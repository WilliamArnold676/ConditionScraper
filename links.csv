"Learning that your pet has cancer is devastating. Deciding on which, if any, treatment path to take is confusing and it is normal to feel anxious as you are making decisions for your pet. Owners frequently struggle with feeling a lack of control and search for options to enhance their pet’s prognosis during their treatment plan. While most of these choices are not harmful, sometimes an owner’s best intentions can unknowingly offset their pet’s progress. The following are suggestions of what to consider avoiding during cancer treatment to optimize your pet’s care.
"
"You might be tempted to start your pet on supplements, vitamins, or other medications as part of a regimen to aid in their body’s defenses against cancer and to support them through their treatments. Most supplements do not undergo regulation regarding content. These products, which may be touted as “natural,” could negatively interact with your pet’s prescribed medications, reducing the benefit of chemotherapy and harming your pet’s system.
"
"Owners are often surprised to learn that some of the chemotherapy drugs we administer come from plants and are therefore also classified as natural substances. The effects of interactions between different natural substances, such as with conventional medicine and alternative medicine/supplements, are unpredictable at best. Veterinarians who cannot guarantee that mixing the two would not lead to treatment failure or harm will honestly explain their concerns and advise you on how to proceed.
"
"See Dietary Supplements and Cancer Treatment: A Risky Mixture to learn more about potential negative interactions between supplements and chemotherapy.
"
"Some pets with cancer, especially cats, will show signs of a poor appetite during treatment. This occurs because of the disease process itself and in response to the prescribed treatments. In those cases, veterinarians frequently lift the typical dietary restrictions placed on companion animals and permit owners to offer a wider variety of foods, including typically prohibited menu items such as fast food or other kinds of “people” food. But for pets whose normal appetites are not being affected by treatment, overfeeding them and/or routinely offering food items the pet would not normally ingest can cause gastrointestinal upset, which may mimic adverse signs from treatment, leading to confusion about how best to proceed. In addition, pets can easily become overweight even with minimal overfeeding, which can exacerbate previous orthopedic disease and lead to concurrent health problems, including cardiorespiratory disease and pain, resulting in a reduction in the pet’s quality of life.
"
"While it’s understandable to want to keep your pet happy during this difficult time, it’s better to shower your pet with attention and toys and activity and not to overdo it with calorie-rich “comfort” foods.
"
"You may encounter individuals who question your decision to treat your pet’s cancer, arguing that you’re being selfish or traumatizing your animals. Personally, I’ve been told countless times that treating pets with cancer is the equivalent of “torturing” them. Such harsh judgment can be isolating, making you second-guess your choices and intentions. Please find reassurance in knowing that there are thousands of owners who choose to treat their pets, just as you are, and these individuals can be your best resources for information and as sounding boards for you to express your concerns, questions, and frustrations.
"
"Many owners of pets that have undergone cancer treatment are happy to provide insight and advice to owners considering their options. This may be in person or via the Internet. For example, Tripawds is an online community of owners of pets with three (or fewer!) limbs that is an excellent resource for owners considering limb amputation for bone tumors.
"
"Pets receiving chemotherapy can experience temporary drops in their white blood cell counts at specified times following their treatment. During these periods where the immune system is being compromised, animals are more susceptible to infection. While the overall risk of illness is low, there will likely be times you should avoid situations where your pet might encounter new pathogens. This may mean occasionally missing a trip to the dog park or groomer, or keeping your typically outdoor cat indoors for a short period of time. In addition, reducing stress levels to a minimum during periods where your pet may have lowered immune defenses is of utmost importance. This means limiting houseguests (two or four legged) if your pet is the kind to become anxious in such situations, avoiding boarding your pet if you decide to travel (get a pet sitter to stay at your home instead), or taking your pet with you rather than leaving them alone if they have a tendency toward separation anxiety.
"
"While such physical challenges may seem to cause significant negative impacts in your pet’s quality of life, the important consideration is that this change is truly temporary and will only be for a few days following certain medical treatments your pet receives.
"
"You will likely have dozens of questions about your pet’s condition and treatment plan and it’s important to have those questions or concerns addressed as quickly and efficiently as possible. You probably won’t think of all of them right away, so writing them down as they occur to you is important.
"
"While the internet is a valuable resource, internet writers do not know your pet personally. Your veterinarian and/or veterinary oncologist will be the most appropriate resource for your concerns. You should never feel that any question is insignificant, and if you are feeling that you or your pet’s needs are not being met, voice your concerns. This empowers you to make the best decisions about your pet’s care and to feel confident in the plan.
"
"Some questions to consider:

"
"With cancer in dogs and cats, early detection and treatment are critical. By detecting cancer early, you can work with your veterinarian to increase the chance of cure or remission.
"
"But noticing the subtle signs of cancer early enough can be difficult if you don’t know what you are looking for, and sometimes the signs can be so subtle that pet parents may mistake them as a normal part of aging.
"
"Talk to your veterinarian if you notice any of the following subtle signs of cancer in your pet. If the cause is cancer, you can catch it early and start a treatment plan.
"
"Unexplained weight loss in dogs and cats—especially when a pet isn’t on a calorie-restricted diet—can be a sign of cancer. While some cancers can cause quick and dramatic weight loss that is hard to miss, it’s more common that the weight loss is gradual over time. It can be so gradual that, initially, it goes unnoticed by the pet parent.
"
"Sometimes, weight loss isn’t even noticed until the pet is taken to the veterinarian and the change in weight only becomes obvious when compared to historical weight measurements.
"
"If a pet is losing weight even though they’re eating normally, then the top diseases to consider are diabetes mellitus, conditions that affect the digestive tract’s ability to digest and absorb nutrients, hyperthyroidism (more common in cats), and cancer.
"
"While lumps, bumps, and other skin changes are easier to notice on short-haired dogs or cats, many times they go unnoticed on long-haired pets.
"
"Pet parents will also often postpone a veterinary visit if a lump is small; however, you cannot determine if a skin lump is cancerous based on the size. Even the smallest skin lumps can be cancerous.
"
"Tumors of the mammary chain—also known as breast cancer—are often missed by pet owners. Female dogs and cats most commonly develop breast cancer when they were not spayed early in life.
"
"Dogs and cats are also subject to cancers of the gastrointestinal system, vascular system, liver, kidneys, urinary bladder, endocrine glands, immune system, lymphatic system, and reproductive organs. These cancers may cause fluid to accumulate or masses to form in the belly. If your pet is large or overweight, you may not notice any changes until they become life-threatening.
"
"Another place where lumps and bumps can be hidden is in the mouth. Dogs and cats can get oral tumors on the gums, palate, or tongue. Tumors under the tongue are very hard to find—unless you are looking for them!
"
"A normal, healthy pet has a glossy, full coat. Changes in the coat can indicate cancer, such as:
"
"Hair loss
"
"Brittle or dry hair
"
"Excessive dandruff or scaling
"
"Skin infections that don’t respond well to treatment
"
"Excessive shedding
"
"Skin cancers can directly affect a pet’s coat, but so can cancer elsewhere in the body. For example, cancers of the endocrine system, such as tumors on the pituitary, thyroid, or adrenal glands, can all cause changes in your pet’s coat.
"
"Overgrooming, no grooming, or excessive licking at a body part can also be subtle signs of cancer in both dogs and cats. If a body part is painful due to cancer, a dog may excessively lick that area, which can cause brown lick stains and hair loss.
"
"If a cat feels sick or is in pain, they may not groom enough or at all, which can lead to a matted, unkempt coat. Alternatively, cats are also known to overgroom and pull out hair in response to stress or pain.
"
"An increased or decreased appetite can be subtle signs of cancer in dogs and cats. If a pet is feeling yucky or is in pain, then they may not want to eat. Conversely, other cancers can cause a pet to eat more than normal. Some cancers consume a lot of calories, which will increase a pet’s appetite (if they are feeling well enough to eat).
"
"Certain types of aggressive, malignant cancers can cause a pet to eat normal or more than normal amounts of food and still lose weight. And benign tumors of the adrenal or pituitary glands can cause a condition called Cushing’s disease that leads to hormonal changes and an increased appetite.
"
"Changes in your pet’s bathroom schedule are worthy of note when it comes to early detection. Different types of cancer can cause changes in your pet’s potty habits, from an increased need for potty time to constipation.
"
"For example:
"
"Cancer of the gastrointestinal system can cause diarrhea and/or constipation.
"
"Cancer of the adrenal gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, liver, or kidneys can increase thirst in dogs and cats and lead to an increased need to urinate.
"
"Cancer of the urinary system can increase the urge to pee but sometimes obstruct the urethra, which makes it difficult to urinate. So, pets with urinary cancer may have to pee frequently, have accidents inside the house, or seem to strain when urinating.
"
"A change in behavior can also be a subtle sign of brain cancer, metabolic changes associated with cancer, or cancer pain. This includes:
"
"A lack of energy or lack of interest in the things that used to bring your pet joy
"
"Accidents in the house
"
"Changes in sleep patterns
"
"Pacing
"
"Increased aggression or clinginess
"
"Seizures or tremors can also be a sign of cancer, and unless you witness them, they can be missed by pet parents. Some signs that may indicate a pet has experienced a seizure include loss of balance, twitching, excessive drooling, and temporary blindness.
"
"Cancer can cause dogs and cats to cough, so any dog or cat that develops a persistent cough needs to be seen by a veterinarian. A persistent cough can be a potential sign of a tumor pressing on an airway, fluid in or around the lungs, or lung tumors.
"
"Persistent coughing can also be a sign of other pet health issues, so if your pet has a cough they cannot seem to kick, it’s always best to take them to their veterinarian.
"
"Veterinarians are trained to notice any abnormalities in your dog or cat, and a veterinary examination is your best weapon against cancer.
"
"However, most pets only see their veterinarian once or twice a year. So, it’s helpful if you play an active role in monitoring your pet’s health as well. As a pet parent, you see your pet every day, which means you can keep a look out for these potential subtle signs of cancer.
"
"To do at-home checks, you can run your hands over your pet to feel for any lumps or bumps and visually inspect your pet. Don’t forget to inspect the nipples and surrounding tissues in female dogs and cats for any changes, lumps, or bumps.
"
"Feel your pet’s rib cage for any signs of weight gain or loss, or better yet, weigh them monthly and keep a log so you can notice trends early. Look in your pet’s mouth and check their teeth and gums. Hold a treat out, and let your pet lick the treat while you visually inspect the top and bottom of the tongue.
"
"Pet guardians know their pets best, and by conducting these monthly at-home inspections, you may be more likely to catch subtle signs of cancer early enough to make a difference.

"A fistula is characterized as an abnormal passageway between two openings, hollow organs, or cavities. They occur as a result of injury, infection, or disease. A communicating, vertical passageway between the mouth and nasal cavity is called an oronasal fistula. Dolichocephalic dog breeds are more likely to be affected with this condition, especially the Dachshund.
"
"These types of fistulas are caused by the diseased condition of any tooth in the upper jaw. The most common location for an oronasal fistula is where the root of the fourth premolar on the upper jaw enters the palate. This condition will need to be surgically corrected to prevent food and water from passing from the mouth into the nasal cavity. If this should occur, it will cause irritation of the nose, runny nose, inflammation of the sinuses, infection, and possibly pneumonia.
"
"These fistulas can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Symptoms of an oronasal fistula include a chronically runny nose, with or without bleeding, and persistent sneezing.
"
" 
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and oral exam using a periodontal probe to investigate the suspected oronasal fistula.
"
"Canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CCD or CDS) is a condition related to the aging of a dog's brain, which ultimately leads to changes in awareness, deficits in learning and memory, and decreased responsiveness to stimuli. This syndrome in dogs has been compared to dementia or Alzheimer's in humans.
"
"Although the initial dementia symptoms in dogs are mild, they gradually worsen over time, beyond what can be expected with normal aging. These pups experience cognitive decline, or the slow decrease in the brain’s ability to perform normal tasks.
"
"Dementia symptoms in dogs usually start slowly and build over time. 
"
"Every pet is different, and the signs will also vary between animals. If your pup is starting to show signs of concern, contact your veterinarian. 
"
"You can use the DISHAA map shown below to help know what to look for. For each category, give your dog a score from zero to four. Zero means no signs at all, while three means significant changes. 
"
"If your dog scores more than four when you add up the total categories, it’s time to contact their veterinarian.
"
"The DISHAA acronym can help pet parents characterize the most distinct signs and changes associated with CCD.
"
"DISHA refers to these symptoms:
"
"Let’s look at the most common dementia symptoms in dogs.
"
"One of the most common things you may notice is that your senior dog gets disoriented even when he’s in his normal or familiar environment.
"
"Your dog may also have trouble with spatial awareness. They may wander behind the couch and then realize they doesn’t know where they are or how to get out.
"
"At bedtime, you may find your dog in a different part of the house, staring at the wall instead of curled up in their dog bed.
"
"Canine cognitive dysfunction can affect your dog’s interactions with people and other animals.
"
"Some dogs with CCD withdraw from their family and their favorite activities. They may fail to notice when the doorbell rings and seem disinterested in greeting visitors, or they may stop barking at the mail carrier. Your dog may not even respond when you get his leash out to go for a walk. 
"
"Talk with your veterinarian if you notice changes in the way your dog interacts with those around him. They can help rule out potential health issues and help you learn how to support your dog’s evolving needs.
"
"A change in sleep patterns or a disruption in circadian rhythms is one of the more specific dementia symptoms in dogs.
"
"Dogs that used to sleep soundly may now pace all night. Many dogs reverse their normal schedules, so their daytime activities become their nighttime activities. This nightly routine can be frustrating and tiring for pet parents.
"
"Urinating or defecating in the house is one of the most common dog dementia symptoms, especially if the dog was previously house-trained.
"
"It’s important to consider that your dog may have lost their ability to voluntarily control elimination or even to let you know that he needs to go outside.
"
"Dogs with cognitive dysfunction may show a decreased desire to explore and a decreased response to things, people and sounds in their environments.
"
"They may not greet you or they may no longer respond on cue to fetch their favorite toy. They may also be less focused and show an altered response to stimuli.
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. The blood-work should be performed before anesthetizing the dog for surgical correction of the fistula.
"
"
"
"Surgical removal of the tooth, and closure of the passageway is the treatment of choice. A skin flap will be placed in both the mouth and in the nasal cavity during closure.
"
"Since a flap to repair an oronasal fistula undergoes constant tension each time the dog breathes, oronasal fistulae tend to reopen. Additional surgeries with advanced tissue flaps can be performed if this occurs.

"
"Some dogs have trouble finding their food bowls. 
"
"When dogs become disoriented and find themselves somewhere in the house where they do not usually spend time, they may have difficulty tracing their way back to their normal turf, including where their food and water lives. 
"
"Although older dogs experience a normal decline in activity levels, they may also experience symptoms that seem like restlessness. 
"
"Dogs may begin to pace randomly or stare out a window and bark when there is nothing there. They may repeatedly return to an area like a corner and then appear to get ""lost"". 
"
"This will often be more common in the late evening and overnight hours, particularly if they are not able to use their vision as well as they used to. 
"
"Using night lights and confining your pup to familiar areas may help to reduce these concerns.
"
"It’s important to rule out medical conditions as certain symptoms—such as inappropriate urination or defecation—may have other causes.
"
"Many dementia symptoms in dogs can also occur with medical problems, so it’s important to consult your veterinarian when you first notice these signs. 
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend some baseline tests such as blood work. This is not only check for a current underlying problem, but also to have results to compare to should things change in the future.

"
"The abnormal development and formation of the mandibular tooth, a molar located three teeth away from the midline of the jaw, is an oral health issue seen primarily in small breed dogs. The mandibular tooth is one of the first permanent teeth to develop a calcified crown, and one of the largest.
"
"There is no gender or particular breed predilection, but small breed dogs are at risk due to the small amount of space in the jaw  for the molar to grow into. Therefore, it is generally recommended that small breed dogs be given a full evaluation of the mandibular first molars as they are growing in. 
"
"The defect will appear at the neck of the madibular tooth, often with gum evidence that the gum is receding. There may even be extensive bone loss near the root and possible exposure of pulp inside of the tooh. X-rays may reveal discontinuity between the roots and crown and/or presence of pulpal stones in the 	canal or chamber of the tooth.
"
"One of the possible causes for this developmental problem is a  mechanical challenge (lack of space) in the mouths of small dogs that  impede proper crown-root development. Invagination, a folding in of the  enamel and/or cement of the tooth, sometimes occurs at the neck of the  tooth, often with some degree of gingival recession (receding of gums)  at the site.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and oral exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms, if there have been any. Dens-in-dente, an anomaly of development resulting from the deepening of enamel into the dental papilla (the cells involved in the developing tooth), typically begins at the crown and often extends to the root before the calcification of the dental tissues takes place. Traumatic damage to the tooth, possibly from aggressive deciduous tooth (i.e., baby tooth) extraction, may be linked to a loss of dental integrity.
"
"If your veterinarian finds that the tooth is too damaged to remain, an assessment of the remaining mandibular bone will be an important prior to an extraction attempt. The diagnostic evaluation will include taking a dental X-ray to evaluate the extent of the changes, particularly at the roots.
"
"
"
"Treatment for a dilacerated mandibular first molar will begin with the appropriate pre-operative antimicrobial and pain management therapy as it is indicated. In most cases, there will be indications of a non-vital pulp in the tooth, indicated by a wide canal, periapical (apex of the root), and bone loss. Extraction of the tooth is typically warranted. However, this should not be an aggressive procedure. Care should be taken, as osteolysis (the active resorption or dissolution of bone tissue) could result in a compromised mandible (lower jaw). Your veterinarian may consider the use of bone-promoting material after the extraction.
"
"Although rare, an endodontic procedure may be attempted to save the tooth in cases with minimal pathological changes. There is also a possibility stones in the tooth chamber could complicate canal access.
"
"Your veterinarian will prescribe pain medication to help mitigate the amount of pain your dog is in, and to facilitate normal eating. After the initial care, your veterinarian will want to recheck your dog’s teeth at least once to be sure there is no infection and that the healing is on schedule. The prognosis is guarded for maintaining the tooth. However, an affected dog's long term health is fair to good if a tooth extraction is performed.

"
"Rectoanal polyps is characterized by the growth of flap-like protrusions in the anal and rectal walls. The polyps may be directly attached to the intestinal wall (sessile), or attached through a stalk-like cylindrical connection.
"
"Most rectoanal polyps are non-cancerous, and are merely extensions of the innermost tissue lining of the intestinal walls. And while most cases of polyps are usually isolated, there are occasions dogs suffer from multiple polyps.
"
"The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how rectoanal polyps affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Dogs suffering from this condition will demonstrate straining or pain while passing stools. The stools may be stained with blood and/or covered with mucus.
"
"The exact cause of rectoanal polyps is not clearly known. However, middle-aged and older dogs are more likely to contract this disorder.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Some of the common tests include a complete blood count and a urinalysis, which will usually return as normal. Imaging tools, such as X-rays and ultrasounds, are not applicable to this particular diagnosis.
"
"Some conditions that may produce symptoms similar to those caused by polyps include abscesses, tumors, inflammation, infection of the intestine, and rectal prolapse. Diagnosis, therefore, is usually made on the basis of a manual rectal examination by a veterinarian, or by direct visualization of the polyp through the external anal opening.
"
"After a polyp is identified, a colonoscopy, using a tubular, flexible camera inserted through the anal opening, may be performed to check for the presence of other polyps. A detailed pathological study of the tissue, as well as the fluid from the polyp, may also be completed.
"
"
"
"Surgery is usually indicated for the effective management of polyps. The polyps may be removed through the anal opening, after which the anal opening will be closed with stitches. The same removal surgery may be performed endoscopically, or by using an electrical needle or probe. Some medications that may be prescribed are:
"
"Possible complications include a relapse of the polyps and narrowing of the anal opening due to scarring and/or inflammation.
"
"An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal, low resistance connection between an artery and a vein. If large enough, the fistula may cause a significant fraction of the total cardiac output to bypass the capillary bed, making it so that the tissues receive little or no oxygen. The heart, in turn, tries to compensate for the lack of oxygen by pumping blood out to the body at a faster rate, which may lead “high output” congestive heart failure.
"
"The location of arteriovenous fistulae varies; reported sites include the head, neck, ear, tongue, limbs, flank, spinal cord, cerebrum (part of the brain), lung, liver, vena cava (major vein leading back to the heart), and gastrointestinal tract.
"
"The symptoms associated with an arteriovenous fistula will ultimately depend on the size and location of the fistula. Typically, there is a warm, non-painful lesion at the site of the fistula. If the lesion is on a limb, the dog may display:
"
"Signs of congestive heart failure, which is often associated with this type of fistula, include:
"
"If the arteriovenous fistula causes organ failure, your dog may display:
"
"Dogs are rarely born with arteriovenous fistulas. Typically, they acquire the fistula due to  traumatic damage to blood vessels, surgery complications, tumor(s), or problems arising from drawing blood or injections around the blood vessels (e.g., barbiturates)
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel to help identify complications associated with an arteriovenous fistula. Biochemical abnormalities, for example, may suggest liver, kidney or other organ dysfunction.
"
"Because arteriovenous fistulae significantly affect the dog's blood flow, thoracic X-rays may show enlargement of the heart and signs of over-circulation to the lungs. In addition, a Doppler ultrasound may show high-velocity, turbulent flow within the lesion.
"
"To locate the arteriovenous fistula, your veterinarian may employ an echocardiogram on the dog. And to outline the lesion, which may be necessary for definitive diagnosis and is highly desirable for presurgical evaluation, the veterinarian may use selective angiography.
"
"
"
"Dogs with clinical signs must undergo surgery to divide and remove abnormal connections between blood vessels.  However, surgery can be difficult and labor-intensive and may require blood transfusions. While often successful, the arteriovenous fistula may recur even after surgery. Some dogs may even require amputation of the affected appendage.
"
"A newer treatment option called transcatheter embolization involves using a catheter to block blood vessels. This method is particularly advantageous because it is relatively noninvasive and provides access to remote lesions via the blood vessels.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to schedule regular follow-up appointments to evaluate your dog, especially if it underwent surgery. This will also enable him or her to determine whether the arteriovenous fistula has recurred.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to examine the surgical site after 14 days to make sure that the condition has been resolved and the tissue is healing properly.
"
"Another examination will be made at three months, and again at six months after surgery. Follow-up examinations will continue twice a year to check for recurrence. Dogs with single polyps usually do not relapse, those with multiple or diffuse lesions are at a much higher risk for recurrence.

"
"Ah, the joys of the outdoors. Swimming, hiking and going to the park—all reasons to look forward to going outside. But fleas? Not so much.
"
"Not only are these blood-sucking parasites unsightly and creepy, but they can also cause some serious issues, such as allergies and skin infections.
"
"So, how can you keep your dog flea-free year-round?
"
"All pets in your household should receive flea prevention, even if you don’t think they have fleas. All pets are at risk, including those that don’t spend much time outside. It just takes one trip outdoors to bring fleas into the home, which can quickly infest the house and put you and your pets at risk.
"
"It’s also important to provide flea prevention year-round, even in colder climates, as fleas will happily survive in a heated home environment for up to a year.
"
"Here are 9 methods for keeping fleas away—not just from biting your canine companions but also from getting into your home in the first place.
"
"Giving your dog a flea bath with a special medicated flea shampoo can be an inexpensive (though labor-intensive) method of protecting your dog year-round. Many flea shampoos kill fleas on contact and prevent them from returning.
"
"In addition to killing adult fleas during bathing, the best flea shampoos for dogs also prevent flea eggs and larvae from maturing into adults for a prolonged period of time. Many of these shampoos also include ingredients like oatmeal or aloe to soothe itchy skin.
"
"You may need to give your dog a flea bath as often as every one to two weeks, as the effective ingredients won’t last as long as a topical or oral medication.
"
"While topical flea medications seem like they would only work on the spot they are applied to, they are actually very effective at covering the dog’s entire body.
"
"The drops work by a process of translocation, where the dog’s oil glands spread the medication throughout the body.
"
"These medications are not affected by bathing, swimming or being out in the rain.
"
"Topical treatments will kill and repel fleas for several weeks before the need for reapplication and may also work to interrupt the flea life cycle.
"
"Your veterinarian can help you to pick out the best topical product for your dog that’s appropriate for her age, size and breed. You will need your vet’s prescription to purchase topical flea and tick medication.
"
"Flea pills are popular with pet parents, and they can be used alone or in combination with topical treatments depending on how severe the flea risk is.
"
"Once-a-month flea control pills come in the form of small, chewable tablets. They work to disrupt the life cycle of fleas but will not kill adult fleas on your pet.
"
"Flea pills are somewhat easy to administer, even for dogs that are difficult to medicate, with added flavors to make them more like treats.
"
"Flea collars are another option, though their effectiveness may depend on the invasiveness of the fleas in your environment and how much contact the flea collar makes with your dog's skin (in order to transfer the chemicals).
"
"Your veterinarian can help you decide if a flea collar is an effective solution for your dog.
"
"Before choosing a particular flea collar, find one that is appropriate for your dog’s age and size. Keep in mind that some collars can have a strong smell that may be offensive, so be sure to read reviews before purchasing. 
"
"After fitting a flea collar for your dog, cut off any excess length of collar to prevent your dog from chewing on it. Watch for signs of discomfort (e.g., excessive scratching) when your dog is wearing the collar in case an allergic reaction occurs.
"
"A flea dip is a concentrated chemical that needs to first be diluted in water and then applied to the dog’s fur with a sponge or poured over their back.
"
"This is not like a shampoo bath, and you will not rinse your dog off after applying the dip product.
"
"The chemicals used in flea dips typically kill adult fleas for two weeks or less. These chemical products can be very potent and are messy to administer, so flea dips have become less popular than other control methods.
"
"Ask your veterinarian if a flea dip is recommended for your dog; misuse can lead to toxic reactions, both in pets and in the people treating them.
"
"Flea powders (the kind you apply on your pet), sprays and wipes are relatively inexpensive methods for repelling fleas.
"
"However, the spray or fine powder forms can be irritating to the mouth and lungs if breathed in (for both dogs and humans). It’s important to avoid applying these products near your pet’s eyes, nose and mouth.
"
"As these products will wear off the skin faster than a topical treatment, you may need to reapply them as often as every two days.
"
"Ask your vet before using flea powders, sprays and wipes, and use them with caution. These are not the most effective or convenient methods for flea control on your pet.
"
"Did you know that adult fleas account for less than five percent of the total flea population in an infected home? That’s why a thorough house cleaning is a crucial step in breaking the parasite’s life cycle for even mild infestations.
"
"You will need to clean daily until the situation has been brought under control, as immature fleas can persist for several months in the environment.
"
"Vacuum the entire house, giving extra focus to your dog’s favorite areas and all corners and baseboards. A recent study has shown that vacuuming can collect and kill fleas at all life stages—it is 96 percent effective at killing adult fleas and 100 percent effective at killing flea eggs.
"
"Wash all of your dog’s bedding and toys with hot, soapy water, and vacuum the car, too. Even if your dog never rides in your car, you may be carrying fleas on your shoes or pant cuffs.
"
"Removing the majority of flea eggs and larvae will help reduce the population of adult fleas hatching in your home.
"
"To further treat your home, sprays, carpet flea powders and/or foggers are available that will kill the adult fleas, as well as the larvae and eggs as they hatch.
"
"Sprays and foggers are available at your veterinarian’s office, but they must be used with caution, as these products can be toxic to fish, birds, cats and children.
"
"Most carpet flea powders claim to kill adult fleas, flea eggs and flea larvae, and some will even kill ticks.
"
"Read labels carefully and ask for advice from your veterinarian before attempting to use these products. If you’re concerned about treating your home thoroughly in cases of severe infestation, you may want to hire a professional exterminator.
"
"           
"
"Keeping your lawn, bushes and trees consistently trimmed back will help reduce the population of fleas in your backyard.
"
"If you still have a problem, consider using yard sprays or granular treatments. Or, you might consider hiring a pest control service for regular yard treatments.
"
"Just be careful when using these products, as they can be harmful to pets, pond fish and humans.
"
"Talk to your vet about which of these methods you should be using for your own flea situation—you might need combine several to provide comprehensive flea treatment for your pets and your home.

"A dog’s urinary tract consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. These anatomical parts of the urinary tract are located inside the abdomen as well as in an area in the back of the abdomen called the retroperitoneal space.
"
"The urinary tract has many functions, some of the most important include filtering the blood to remove toxins, maintaining balance of electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium), and reabsorbing water for the body. Urine is created as a waste by-product. Unfortunately, problems can occur at any of the areas along the urinary tract. Problems of the urinary tract can range from an uncomplicated infection to serious cancers
"
"Urinary tract infection or “UTI,” is a general term most often used to describe infection of the lower part of the urinary tract (the urinary bladder and/or urethra). Urinary tract infections can cause straining to urinate, blood in the urine, frequently urinating small volumes only or urinating in inappropriate places. Urinary tract infections are common in dogs and can be caused by many different types of bacteria. Urinary tract infections can also occur secondary to an underlying problem such as urinary crystals, stones, or cancers.
"
"Urinary bladder infections are also common in dogs and typically are treatable and curable. A UTI can be painful and require a prescription medication to resolve. Some dogs with a urinary bladder infection will drink more water. Therefore, it is important to monitor your dog’s drinking and urinary habits. 
"
"“Lower urinary tract disease” is a general term that can describe multiple problems of the bladder and/or urethra. Some dogs experience infection, while others can have inflammation without infection (sterile cystitis). The symptoms are similar for both issues, but are treated differently, depending on the cause. Many dogs will drink more, strain to urinate, pass blood in their urine, or have accidents in the house.
"
"Stones that develop in a dog’s urinary bladder can become an emergency, if left untreated. When first formed in the body, they may go unnoticed for some time. However, if a stone from the urinary bladder moves to the urethra (which has a much smaller diameter), it can become stuck and block the flow of urine.
"
"This can cause the urinary bladder to overfill and rupture, causing dogs to become septic and die from urine leakage inside the abdomen. Many dogs with urinary bladder stones will strain to urinate or attempt to urinate repeatedly but pass only small amounts of urine.
"
"The most common type of cancer that develops in the urinary bladder in dogs is called transitional cell carcinoma. It most often develops in an area of the bladder called the trigone, where urine exits the bladder into the urethra to be voided. This painful cancer can cause symptoms such as straining to urinate, blood in the urine, and urinating small volumes at a time.
"
"Urinary incontinence is a common urinary problem seen most often in female dogs, but it can also occur in males. Urinary incontinence typically is seen as leaking of urine (large or small volumes) where the pet has been lying. Urinary incontinence often results from weak sphincter muscle tone at the urinary bladder.
"
"There are many causes of kidney failure in dogs, including injury, infection, toxins, some medications, and cancer. Ultimately, when the kidneys can no longer perform their function, dogs struggle with multiple symptoms. Typically, dogs suffering with kidney failure have a decreased appetite, often urinate large amounts of urine, experience possible weight loss, and may have episodes of vomiting and/or diarrhea.
"
"Diseases of the urinary tract in dogs that can have similar symptoms—but are less common—include pyelonephritis (kidney infection), kidney stones, proteinuria, neurologic conditions affecting the urinary bladder (atony), and problems of the ureters or urethra (e.g., strictures, diverticulum).
"
"Diseases that start in other body systems, but may show signs in the urinary tract, include prostate diseases in male dogs, pyometra in female dogs, Cushing’s disease (hyperadrenocorticism), diabetes mellitus, and diabetes insipidus. 
"
"As a pet parent it’s important to know your pet’s normal patterns and behaviors when drinking, eating, urinating, and defecating. For pets that live in multiple-pet households and share the same bowl for water, it can be difficult to tell, so you may need to temporarily separate your pets to determine what is normal and abnormal for each.
"
"The most common symptoms of urinary issues in dogs are related to the amount of water consumed (too much or too little) and abnormal urination patterns such as straining to urinate, urinating small or large volumes, having urinary accidents, or having blood present in the urine.
"
"Urinary issues in dogs are common and many are treatable. Dogs of all ages, breeds, and sizes, as well as both male and female dogs, get urinary issues. Sometimes the cause can be prevented with proper hygiene and weight management. Other times, genetics, diet, and lifestyle play a role in the development of urinary issues.
"
"Many types of urinary problems have similar symptoms. However, treatment is different based on the cause of the issue, so it is important to make a proper diagnosis. Your veterinarian will likely order some tests to aid in determining the cause.
"
"Initially, a urinalysis test is performed to examine your pet’s urine. This urine sample needs to be fresh. Sometimes, your veterinarian may also analyze bloodwork, submit urine for culturing, take X-rays, or use an ultrasound to better evaluate your pet’s urinary problem. Most of these tests can be done with your regular veterinarian, but in some cases pets may need to be referred to an internal medicine specialist for more advanced testing like an endoscopy or biopsy sampling.
"
"Depending on the issue, treatment can range from a short course of medication or dietary changes to surgical intervention. When you notice any urinary issues, it is best to seek the help of your veterinarian as soon as possible to determine a diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy.   
"
"Many urinary issues can be resolved with therapy, and your dog can get back to its normal activities. If your veterinarian recommends follow-up testing after a course of medications, it is important to complete this step to make sure that the problem is stabilized, improving, or completely cleared. When your dog has its annual exam, make sure to discuss any changes in eating, drinking, and eliminating with your veterinarian.
"
"Try to keep your pet at a proper weight and follow strict hygiene, as long hair/mats around the urogenital area can contribute to urinary problems. Occasionally when a pet has diarrhea, it can lead to urinary issues, as the rectum and vulva in females are near each other. Be sure your pet has access to clean, fresh drinking water at all times.
"
"Some people even choose to use bottled water for their pets with urinary problems. There are some diets and supplements based on promoting urinary health that can be beneficial. However, different urinary problems require different approaches to maintain bladder health, so always work with your veterinarian before starting any therapy, including diets and supplements.

"Sinus bradycardia (SB) is indicated by a slower-than-normal rate of impulses in the sinus node. Also called the sinoatrial node (SAN), the sinus node initiates the electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat or contract. In most instances, slow sinus electrical impulses is benign and may even be beneficial; however, it can also cause loss of consciousness if it is brought about by an underlying disease that disrupts the cardiac autonomic nerves, which act as the heart's control system.
"
"SB is fairly common in dogs, especially in cocker spaniels, dachshunds, pugs, West Highland white terriers, and female miniature schnauzers. In addition, this condition is more common in young dogs than old, with the incidence decreasing with age, unless it is being caused by an underlying disease.
"
" 
"
"Your dog may display no symptoms if it very active or engaging in athletic training. Typically, the sinus bradycardia (heartbeat slower than 60 beats per minute, although depends on the animal's environment and size) is most apparent when your dog is at rest. Some other common symptoms associated with sinus bradycardia include:
"
" 
"
" 
"
" 
"
" 
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms, your dog's overall condition, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. 
"
" 
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis -- the results of which may indicate the presence of substances that might be causing a slowed heart rate. These tests will also reveal deficiencies in the blood if that is the underlying cause. They also may offer clues to possible kidney failure. Your doctor can also use X-rays and ultrasound to visually examine your dog's internal organs for abnormalities in the heart, kidney and other organs. An electrocardiogram (EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction, which underlies the heart’s ability to contract and beat. An initial 24-hour heart monitoring may be indicated to conclude a diagnosis. 
"
" 
"
"
"
" 
"
"Treatment will be determined by any underlying disease that is found. Many dogs exhibit no clinical signs and require no treatment. In dogs without structural heart disease, heart rates as low as 40 to 50 bpm (beats per minute) are still generally able to provide normal cardiac output at rest. Therapeutic approaches vary markedly; they depend on what’s causing the SB, the ventricular rate, and the severity of clinical signs.
"
" 
"
"If your dog is in critical condition, it may be treated as an inpatient, where intravenous fluid therapy can be administered and the dog's health stabilized. Restrictions on activity will not be recommended unless your dog has symptomatic SB that is related to structural heart disease; then exercise restriction will be recommended until medical and/or surgical intervention can stabilize the problem.
"
" 
"
"Your physician will order further monitoring depending on the final diagnosis. Signs, if present, should resolve with correction of the causative underlying condition. However, the overall long term prognosis varies with the nature of the structural heart disease, if there is one present. For example, treatment of symptomatic SB with a permanent pacemaker generally offers a good prognosis for rhythm control.

"Dogs have two types of sweat glands: apocrine and eccrine.
"
"Apocrine sweat glands: These are located at the base of hair follicles all over the dog’s body. Although they are considered a type of sweat gland, apocrine glands don’t actually produce sweat. Instead, they produce a thick fluid loaded with pheromones that help dogs identify each other by scent. 
"
"Eccrine (or merocrine) sweat glands: These are similar to the sweat glands humans have that produce a clear, odorless fluid and helps cool us off. In dogs, eccrine glands are located in the paws, meaning that dogs “sweat” from their paws. However, sweating is not the primary way dogs cool off (that’s panting), and dogs have far fewer eccrine glands than humans.
"
"Additionally, dogs have another type of skin gland called a sebaceous gland, which is also located near the hair follicle. Sebaceous glands are sometimes called oil glands and secrete an oily fluid called sebum that helps moisturize and protect your dog’s skin and coat. 
"
"An adenocarcinoma is type of malignant tumor that occurs in the dog’s skin, including sweat glands and the sebaceous glands. Adenocarcinomas in the eccrine glands in dog paws are extremely rare. Instead, the vast majority of these tumors occur in the skin.  
"
"Adenocarcinomas in dogs commonly look like raised, irregularly shaped masses, but they may also look like a skin ulcer or sore. They can appear anywhere on the body, but are most commonly found in a dog’s “armpit” where their legs meet their bodies and in the groin area. They are most common in mixed-breed dogs, as well as large breeds including German Shepherds and Norwegian Elkhounds. 
"
"The most common symptom of a sweat gland, sebaceous adenocarcinoma is a bump, or mass, on the skin that develops quickly and may grow rapidly. These masses are usually irregular in shape, are firm, and may be the same color of your dog’s skin or another color. They are usually not painful when touched but may occasionally bleed or ooze.
"
"There are no known causes of sebaceous in dogs. However, they often occur more frequently in older animals and some breeds are predisposed to developing sweat gland sebaceous adenocarcinoma.
"
"If your vet suspects a skin adenocarcinoma, they will perform an examination. This may include reviewing the dog’s health record and discussing any symptoms you’ve noticed, including difficulty swallowing or eating, bad breath, etc.
"
"You veterinarian may perform a fine needle biopsy to collect cells from the tumor to examine under a microscope. During this test, the vet will insert a very fine needle into the tumor to collect a small sample of cells. The cells will be examined under a microscope to determine if they are cancerous.  
"
"Your veterinarian may also perform a surgical procedure to remove all, or a piece, of the tumor. The removed tissue will be sent to a medical provider called a pathologist who specializes in examining tissue to determine if the tumor is an adenocarcinoma. 
"
"Surgical removal of the tumor is the most common treatment of skin adenocarcinomas.   
"
"Chemotherapy may also be recommended if your veterinarian was unable to remove all of the tumor or the cancer has spread (also called metastasized) to your dog’s lymph nodes. 
"
"Radiation therapy may also be prescribed to treat a skin adenocarcinoma.
"
"Following surgery, your veterinarian may prescribe medicine to ease pain and reduce inflammation, along with antibiotics to prevent infection. Your dog may also require a follow-up visit with your veterinarian to inspect the surgical site and ensure proper healing. 
"
"Your dog should recover completely if a sweat gland, sebaceous adenocarcinoma is completely removed before the cancer spreads to other parts of the body. In rare instances, a sebaceous adenocarcinoma spreads to nearby parts of the body, but it can also spread throughout a larger portion of a dog’s body. 
"
"Most dogs live full lives after diagnosis and treatment for sebaceous  adenocarcinomas.
"
"Skin adenocarcinomas are locally invasive and spread easily to nearby lymph nodes, but they generally do not metastasize to other parts of the body.
"
"Yes, skin adenocarcinomas are curable with surgical removal and chemotherapy, if required.

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) refers to a condition of sudden respiratory failure due to fluid accumulation and severe inflammation in the lungs. ARDS is a life-threatening problem, with current mortality rates in dogs at almost 100 percent. This condition is also medically referred to as shock lung, as it occurs following an episode which leads to a state of shock, such as traumatic injury. As typified by a syndrome, ARDS is indicative of an underlying medical condition, usually an injurious event that has allowed blood, fluid and tissue to cross over the barrier and into the alveoli, the air cells in the lungs, causing them to collapse. Once the alveoli have been compromised in this way, breathing becomes labored, and eventually impossible if not treated with haste.
"
"In humans there appears to be a genetic factor for the development of ARDS, but this factor has not yet been investigated in dogs.
"
"Acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur in a number of conditions and with varying symptoms, depending upon the underlying cause. Following are some general symptoms seen with ARDS:
"
"Following are a few of the major causes of ARDS in dogs:
"
"Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention. Your veterinarian will evaluate your dog's condition and start emergency treatment at once. You will need to provide your veterinarian with a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as trauma to any part of the body, or inhalation of gases, fumes, or solid matter. Along with the emergency treatment your veterinarian will work to find the underlying cause for the sudden lung failure. Various laboratory test panels will be ordered, including blood tests, serum biochemical tests, urine tests and blood gas analysis. Blood gas analysis is one of the most important diagnostic methods used in veterinary practice for the diagnosis of ARDS. Your veterinarian will also order chest X-rays and echocardiography in order to visually examine and evaluate the functioning capability of the lungs and heart.
"
"
"
"Dogs suffering from this syndrome will need emergency treatment in an intensive care unit. Along with emergency treatment, the underlying cause must be established and treated in order to prevent further complications or death. Despite recent advances, ARDS remains one of the most difficult and challenging problems to treat in veterinary practice.
"
"Supplemental oxygen therapy will be started immediately to minimize the respiratory distress. If your dog does not respond well to the oxygen therapy and continues to have severe breathing problems, there may be more success with ventilator supported breathing. Medications for treating ARDS include antibiotics, pain killers, fluid therapy, and corticosteroids for reducing inflammation and swelling. Frequent readings of temperature, pulse, respiration rate, and blood pressure will be necessary for following your dog's progress in the initial stage of the treatment. If your dog has been placed on ventilator support it may also require regular physiotherapy sessions and frequent changes in body position to prevent complications related to ventilator support. Dogs affected with ARDS are kept in strict cage confinement until they have fully recovered.
"
"Addison's disease in dogs (also called hypoandrenocorticism) occurs when your dog's adrenal glands aren't producing adequate levels of corticosteroid hormones. If diagnosed and treated appropriately, these dogs can live a long, happy life.
"
"The adrenal glands are two small glands next to the kidneys. The glands are responsible for producing corticosteroid hormones, including the so-called “stress” hormones. The different types of corticosteroids are: 
"
"Glucocorticoids (such as cortisol): Affect protein, sugar, and fat metabolism. These metabolites are stored and will be used in “fight or flight” situations 
"
"Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone): Help control sodium and potassium. 
"
"When animals (and humans) are under stress, the adrenal glands are stimulated to produce stress hormones that may cause a range of internal and behavioral effects. In dogs, a stress response can look like: 
"
"Compulsively climbing the stairs 
"
"Pacing and visibly anxious 
"
"Interactions with other dogs 
"
"Excitement when you come home from work 
"
"In a dog with Addison’s disease, the adrenal glands don’t produce enough hormones to maintain normal stress levels. Without our corticosteroid hormones to help us adapt to stressful situations, even the tiniest of stressors can cause serious issues and in severe cases, death.  
"
"ARDS is a very serious health problem needing constant support from your side for the successful treatment, management and care of the condition. Be sure to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines closely, and if you are in doubt, consult with the doctor. If an underlying disease has not been conclusively diagnosed and resolved, another episode of respiratory distress may follow. Dogs that have been affected, and have survived this condition usually need time, rest, and good nutrition to fully recover. Do not confine your dog to stuffy or hot places, and allow your dog to signal when it has had enough walking or exercise. Some dogs will have scarring of the lungs even after the condition has been resolved, a condition referred to as fibrosis, and the tissue of the lungs will be stiffer and less capable of holding oxygen. Following the diet and management recommendations made by your veterinarian, and keeping activity minimal will be the best course for preventing a recurrence.

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Addison’s disease can be hard to detect by signs alone. Most commonly, Addison's disease is diagnosed as an accidental finding when annual blood work is performed and your vet finds an electrolyte imbalances. Your veterinarian may become suspicious if your dog has waxing and waning signs of lethargy, decreased appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea.  
"
"Approximately 30% of dogs with Addison’s disease are diagnosed after experiencing an Addisonian crisis. An Addisonian crisis occurs when a dog collapses in shock from the inability to adapt to external or internal stressors. This can lead to severely elevated potassium levels, which can cause abnormal heart rhythms and a very slow heart rate. Addison’s disease can also cause severe hypoglycemia (dangerously low blood sugar).  
"
"An Addisonian crisis can only occur when about 90% of the adrenal cortex (the outer layer of the adrenal gland) is not functioning. This crisis can be fatal if shock is not treated quickly, aggressively, and appropriately. 
"
"There are two types of hypoadrenocorticism: 
"
"Primary hypoadrenocorticism: This occurs when your dog’s immune system attacks the adrenal glands. Drug-induced necrosis (or death) of the adrenal gland is possible also with medications such as ketoconazole, trilostane, and lysodren.  
"
"Secondary hypoadrenocorticism: This may occur when the releasing hormones produced in the brain are decreased. This can be caused by inflammation, cancer, brain trauma, or congenital abnormalities. 
"
"Dogs with Addison’s disease are usually young (most commonly around three to six years old), though any age can be affected. Typically, female dogs are affected more often than male dogs. The most common breeds with Addison’s disease include: 
"
"West Highland White Terriers 
"
"Great Danes 
"
"Basset Hounds 
"
"Portuguese Water Dogs 
"
"Airedale Terriers 
"
"Standard poodles 
"
"Bearded collies  
"
"Please keep in mind that any dog of any breed or age can be affected. 
"
"There are a couple of different ways that vets diagnose Addison’s disease, including getting a thorough medical history, thorough physical examination, full blood work, and an ACTH stimulation blood test (a test that investigates low cortisol). If the dog responds well to the treatment of shock with intravenous fluids and steroid administration, the veterinarian may suspect Addison’s disease as an underlying cause of the shock. 
"
"Full blood work can reveal elevated potassium and low sodium levels. Atypical, or unusual, Addison’s disease does not reveal these electrolytes changes on blood work and is considered a different type of Addison’s disease. Sometimes azotemia (or elevated kidney enzymes) can mimic kidney disease, while in less common instances, the blood sugar may be low, which can mimic a pancreatic tumor (called an insulinoma).  
"
"The primary test used to diagnose Addison’s disease is the ACTH test. The test starts with drawing a blood sample to measure the baseline cortisol (stress hormone) level, followed by administration of an intravenous dose of ACTH, the brain hormone that is responsible for releasing corticosteroids in times of stress.  
"
"One hour later, another blood sample is drawn to measure how your dog responded to ACTH. If your dog’s baseline cortisol is low and there is minimal response to the stress hormone, Addison’s disease can be diagnosed. 
"
"Baseline cortisol levels are sometimes checked in emergency situations. If they are low, a full ACTH stimulation blood test may be given when the dog is more stable. Sometimes, an abdominal ultrasound is performed to identify small adrenal glands.  
"
"Other blood tests can include urine cortisol creatinine ratio, endogenous plasma ACTH levels, and plasma renin levels (tests focusing on the dog’s plasma levels). Usually, these non-Addison’s disease patients will have a normal ACTH stimulation test. 
"
"Dog breeds originating from the Pacific Rim (such as Shiba Inus and Akitas) usually have elevated potassium levels on blood work. Keep in mind that whipworm infection can falsely raise potassium and drop sodium levels, which may cause confusion when diagnosing Addison’s disease.  
"
"In an Addisonian crisis, treatment focuses on aggressive intravenous fluid therapy and injectable steroids. Treatment of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and/or abnormal heart rhythms might also be necessary. Most dogs respond quickly to treatment and tend to make a complete recovery. 
"
"The most important part of Addison’s treatment is replacing the mineralocorticoids (like aldosterone, which is the steroid hormone). This can be done through administering oral medication (fludrocortisone) twice daily or with an injection of DOCP (desoxycorticosterone pivalate) approximately every 25-30 days. Depending on your pet’s diagnosis, you will be able to determine a treatment plan with your veterinarian. 
"
"If your dog is prescribed fludrocortisone, it has both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity. In contrast, dogs receiving the injectable DOCP require additional glucocorticoid supplementation (such as oral prednisone), since it only has mineralocorticoid activity.  
"
"Some experts believe that DOCP better regulates electrolytes than oral fludrocortisone, but it usually comes down to preference of each veterinarian and what formulation is best for the dog. For example, some dogs do not do well with injections, while others are more difficult to orally medicate. Your vet will be able to determine what works best for your dog based on their diagnosis.  
"
"Electrolyte blood testing and ACTH stimulation testing are usually performed at different intervals after starting therapy, typically on day 10, day 30, and day 90. Mineralocorticoid medication usually gets adjusted after electrolyte levels are stable. Levels will be monitored a few times a year to ensure it’s the correct level for the dog.  
"
"If your dog is under extra stress, glucocorticoid dosing can be increased. For example, veterinary visits, car rides, pet parents going out of town, or other activities can cause stress to Addisonian dogs. Increasing the dose of steroids for a short time may help prevent lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and especially an Addisonian crisis.   
"
"Dogs going through an Addisonian crisis are typically treated with intravenous fluid therapy to correct electrolyte disturbances, steroids, and medications to correct abnormal heart rhythms. This treatment usually leads to a good chance of recovery and dogs tend to respond quickly.   
"
"Management of Addison’s disease is lifelong. Blood work monitoring may be frequent at the start of treatment and over the first three to six months while your veterinarian is determining the best medication dosing intervals. Most dogs with Addison’s disease do well after they’re diagnosed and live a long, happy life.  
"
"No, Addison’s disease does not go away on its own, medications are necessary to stabilize dogs diagnosed with this condition.
"
"Addison’s disease is fairly common in dogs but it’s not as common as Cushing’s disease, which is basically the opposite of Addison’s disease where the body overproduces steroid and cortisol.
"
"If diagnosed and treated with appropriate medications, a dog can live a full lifespan in the face of an Addison’s diagnosis. If an Addisonian crisis occurs and is left untreated, it can be fatal. 
"
"In most cases we don’t know the cause of Addison’s disease in dogs. It’s considered a primary immune mediated condition but can also occur secondary to certain medications, infections, trauma, or cancers of the adrenal glands.
"
"Unfortunately, we do not know the cause of atypical Addison’s in dogs. This is a condition where a dog can control their electrolyte imbalances through other hormones. In these cases, only glucocorticoids need to be supplemented. These dogs can have all the same symptoms as a typical Addisonian dog but don’t have the shock crisis. The recommendation for an atypical Addisonian patient is to monitor electrolytes every three to six months as most of these dogs eventually progress to the typical form of the disease. 
"
"ACTH stimulation testing is typically the test of choice to rule out Addison’s disease. This can be done at most vet offices and all specialty and emergency facilities. The blood samples are sent to a laboratory to complete the testing and return results back to your vet’s office.

"An acral lick granuloma in dogs, also known as a lick granuloma or acral lick dermatitis, is a skin lesion that is self-induced.
"
"Frequently found on the legs, primarily the lower part of the limbs and feet, this skin condition is caused by a dog excessively licking the same spot. The most common area for a lick granuloma is on the wrist, or carpal joint, of the front limb. The second most common location is the hock, or ankle, of the back legs. Hair loss, redness, and thickened skin are all signs of the condition.
"
"Once a dog starts to repetitively lick one area of the skin, a cycle of self-trauma, inflammation, and infection occurs.
"
"Treatment for these skin lesions is often only somewhat effective in chronic conditions. The earlier the medical intervention, the better chance of successfully treating a lick granuloma in dogs. If you suspect your dog has a lick granuloma, it’s important to have it examined by your veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"Repetitive licking is the primary behavioral symptom, which results in the development of a well-defined, raised, firm, hairless, eroded to ulcerated skin lesion or skin nodule. These lesions are often red in color and wet, as saliva and serum leaking from the skin do not allow them to dry.
"
"Lick granulomas are typically an oval patch of skin or skin lump found on the front surface of a leg. Occasionally, more than one leg may be affected. Lick granulomas often lead to secondary bacterial or fungal skin infections and ruptured hair follicles.
"
"Lick granulomas in dogs are caused by multiple factors. This condition is believed to be both physical and psychological in nature. Typically, lick granulomas occur because of boredom, fear, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.
"
"Underlying conditions that may trigger lick granulomas include:
"
"Stress
"
"Allergies
"
"Skin infections
"
"Trauma–injury
"
"Pain
"
"Behavioral abnormalities
"
"Osteoarthritis
"
"All of these are often catalysts leading to a dog licking themselves constantly and causing skin lesions.
"
"The most common cause for acral lick granulomas is allergy, either environmental or food sensitivity. This condition occurs mainly in medium- to large-breed dogs, most commonly affecting:
"
"German Shepherd
"
"Doberman
"
"Great Dane
"
"Labrador
"
"Golden Retriever
"
"Weimaraner
"
"Irish Setter
"
"If your dog has been licking excessively and has developed a skin lesion, that is often enough to diagnose a lick granuloma, as the location and appearance of the lesion is the guide to diagnosis. It’s important to let your vet know everything about your dog’s history, including:
"
"Known allergies

"
"It is not uncommon for dogs and cats to vomit from time to time. They might have eaten something that upset their stomachs, or just have sensitive digestive systems. However, it becomes acute when the vomiting does not stop and when there is nothing left in the stomach to throw up except bile (a yellow fluid). It is important you take your pet to a veterinarian in these types of cases.
"
"While vomiting may have a simple, straightforward cause, it may be an indicator of something far more serious. It is also problematic because it can have a wide range of causes, and determining the correct one may be quite complicated.
"
"Bring a sample of the vomit to the veterinarian. If there is a lot of mucus, an inflamed intestine may be the cause. Undigested food in the vomit can be due to food poisoning, anxiety, or simply overeating. Bile, on the other hand, indicates an inflammatory bowel disease or inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). If bright red blood is found, the stomach could be ulcerated. However, if the blood is brown and looks like coffee grounds, the problem may be in the intestine. Finally, strong digestive odors are usually observed when there is an intestinal obstruction.
"
"The veterinarian will generally look in your pet’s mouth for foreign objects that may be wedged inside, such as a bone. Enlarged tonsils are another good indicator for this. The pet’s temperature will be taken and an examination of the abdomen will be done. If it turns out to be no more than a passing incident, the veterinarian may ask you to limit the diet to clear fluids and to collect stool samples over that period as the underlying cause may be passed along in the stool. Occasionally, the animal's body may use vomiting to clear the intestines of toxins.
"
"Treatment will be recommended according to the underlying cause behind the vomiting; some possibilities include:
"
"Always follow the recommended treatment plan from your veterinarian. Do not experiment with medications or food. Pay close attention to your pet and if it does not improve, return to your veterinarian for a follow-up evaluation.

"New environment
"
"Stress or trauma
"
"A complete physical examination may help your vet determine the underlying cause of the skin lesion. They may also recommend an x-ray of the limb to check for any arthritis or other bone/joint condition that could be causing pain or discomfort.
"
"Skin testing of the lesion itself, such as an acetate test, a skin culture, skin scraping, or a skin biopsy, might be ordered:
"
"Treatment for a lick granuloma is largely based on the underlying cause. An Elizabethan or inflatable collar is extremely important to prevent further self-harm—both before you can see the vet and afterward, during treatment. Bandages should be placed only with the guidance of your veterinarian, because covering an infected wound traps in moisture, often prevents healing, and can make the condition worse.
"
"If your vet suspects that your dog has a food allergy, a food trial will begin, placing your dog on a very limited ingredient diet. It is essential that during this time, all other foods be prohibited from your dog’s diet, including treats. Medications such as antibiotics, antifungals, anti-inflammatory and pain medications, anti-anxiety drugs, and/or antihistamines might be prescribed. Topical therapy with creams, wipes, or shampoos is often recommended to help with infection..
"
"Common antibiotics for skin infections: Cephalexin, Convenia, Simplicef
"
"Common allergy medications: Apoquel, Zyrtec, hydroxyzine
"
"Antifungal: ketoconazole (oral and topical)
"
"Anti-inflammatory: carprofen, prednisone, Temaril-P
"
"Pain medication: tramadol, gabapentin
"
"Anti-anxiety: alprazolam, fluoxetine, clomipramine
"
"Topical antiseptic: chlorhexidine
"
"Behavior modification training to assist with psychological concerns such as anxiety or stress may be recommended by your veterinarian if allergies are not the cause. Increasing the amount of exercise and play time your dog gets daily can help, so that they spend less time focused on licking. Your vet may also refer you to a pet behaviorist to help if these behaviors are extreme.
"
"CO2 laser and cold laser therapies have been described to help in select dogs. Acupuncture around the affected area also has been helpful in some dogs. Douxo S3 wipes and mousses are great over-the-counter products to use at home, in addition to the collar. You can also bathe your dog with a medicated shampoo, or use a spray to help with itching. On average, treatment of the wound should take 7-14 days.
"
"For most dogs, the prognosis for a lick granuloma is guarded; it is rarely life-threatening but it can be very frustrating to both the dog and the pet parent. Determining the best treatment of a lick granuloma often requires trial and error, and several visits to the vet may be necessary to determine the ideal combination of treatments. Often, lick granulomas are managed long-term instead of looking for a full recovery or resolution. It is worth remembering that stressful changes in your dog’s life may lead to recurrence of the problem.
"
"Your dog’s mouth is full of bacteria and other harmful pathogens, so it’s important to always keep a protective collar on your dog, especially when they are alone or at night, to prevent further licking and infecting the wound.
"
" If left untreated, continued licking can also cause serious infection in the skin’s underlying muscles and bones. Dogs with a lick granuloma that get early treatment have a better prognosis for recovery than dogs with a chronic or severe condition.
"
"For dogs that are predisposed to having lick granulomas for behavioral reasons, allowing them more time to actively play or walking them longer to tire them out helps to decrease the amount of time they can focus on licking.
"
"All dogs should have an exam done by their veterinarian at least once a year, as this can help catch medical conditions early to prevent secondary licking behaviors. An exam should also be performed at the first sign of any illness or skin condition to help prevent this issue as well.
"
"Most arthritis, behavioral, or allergy medications that are proven to help need to be used lifelong to prevent unwanted behaviors such as the repetitive licking that causes lick granulomas. If your veterinarian suspects that stress is causing your dog’s behavior, it’s important to evaluate your dog’s environment and remove stressors wherever possible. If your dog has arthritis, this condition may be managed by medications, gradual weight loss, soft bedding, massage, and diet.

"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition where gastric or intestinal fluids reverse into the esophagus (the tube connecting the mouth to the stomach). This may be due to the muscular opening at the base of the esophagus (called the lower esophageal sphincter) relaxing. While this can occur during anesthesia, it also happens for unknown reasons, too.
"
"Gastroesophageal reflux, also called “acid reflux,” is thought to be fairly common in dogs. It can happen to any dog (and it crops up in cats, too), although younger pups and brachycephalic (flat-faced) dogs are at greater risk.
"
"The gastric acid, pepsin, bile salts, and other components of the gastrointestinal juices cause damage to the protective lining of the esophagus. This can result in inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis).
"
"Gastroesophageal reflux can cause esophagitis, but the condition’s tissue damage and pain levels vary. Mild esophagitis is limited to esophageal lining inflammation, while more severe ulcerative esophagitis causes damage to the deeper layers of the esophagus. 
"
"Symptoms of acid reflux in dogs include:
"
"Regurgitating food
"
"Evidence of pain (whining or pacing, for example)
"
"Lack of appetite
"
"Lip-licking
"
"Coughing
"
"Change in the sound of the bark
"
"Weight loss
"
"Gastroesophageal reflux can happen when an anesthetic is administered, which causes the sphincter between the stomach and the esophagus to relax. Head-down positioning of the patient during anesthesia, or if the dog hasn’t fasted properly pre-anesthesia, may increase the chances of gastroesophageal reflux. Congenital hiatal hernias also heighten the risk for gastroesophageal reflux. 
"
"Young dogs may be at greater risk of developing GERD because their gastroesophageal sphincters are still developing. Long-term or chronic vomiting can also cause esophagitis. 
"
"The best means of diagnosis is generally an endoscopy, an examination that uses a small camera to view the lining of the esophagus and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. This is the most effective way to determine if changes in the lining are consistent with esophagitis due to gastroesophageal reflux.  
"
"Keep in mind that esophagitis can be caused by other issues aside from acid reflux, such as:
"
"Ingestion of a caustic agent
"
"A foreign body in the dog’s throat
"
"A tumor in the esophagus
"
"A hernia next to the esophagus
"
"Megaesophagus, a condition in dogs where the muscles of the esophagus do not function properly in pushing food into the stomach
"
"Other diseases of the mouth, throat, or stomach
"
"Most treatment is done at home. Many dogs respond to eating a low-fat, prescription diet given in small, frequent meals. Dietary fat should be limited because fat stimulates gastric acid secretion.
"
"Medications can also help. Drugs known as gastrointestinal pro-kinetic agents help stomach contents move through the organs and strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter. Veterinarians also often recommend medications to reduce stomach acid production and to protect the lining of the esophagus. 
"
"After initial treatment, continue monitoring for gastroesophageal reflux in your dog, as it may flare up from time to time. Watch for signs of discomfort and the other symptoms of GERD.
"
"A continued low-fat, low-protein diet will help prevent future incidences, and high-fat treats should be avoided, as they may worsen gastroesophageal reflux. Some dogs also require long-term treatment with medications. 
"
"If your dog doesn’t respond to initial medical treatments, follow-up diagnostic testing may be advised. 
"
"High-fat foods can worsen acid reflux. The best way to prevent future flare-ups is a healthy diet that’s low in fat. Also, be sure to keep your dog on any maintenance medications that your veterinarian has recommended.

"Clostridial enterotoxicosis is an intestinal syndrome brought on by abnormally high levels of Clostridium perfringens bacterium, a bacteria found commonly inhabiting decaying vegetation and marine sediment. It can also be acquired from raw or improperly cooked meats and poultry, and meats that have been left out in the open. There is also evidence that dogs can acquire this infection from being with other dogs, such as when boarded at a kennel.
"
"Generally, the implications of the clostridial enterotoxicosis are limited to infections of the intestinal tract and do not progress to systemic disease conditions. Symptoms typically last a week in acute cases and include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea. Long-term (chronic) cases of clostridial enterotoxicosis, meanwhile, involve recurrences of diarrhea, which may repeat every two to four weeks, and may continue for months to years. In fact, clostridial enterotoxicosis in dogs is suspected to occur in up to 20 percent of large bowel diarrhea cases.
"
"Although it is more common in dogs as opposed to cats -- perhaps because dog spend more time amongst vegetation, or eating found meat (such as in refuse) -- most animals have antibodies that will effectively fight the bacteria and clear it from the body.
"
"Clostridial enterotoxicosis is caused by an overgrowth of the bacteria Clostridium perfringens in the intestine. Often, the bacteria is acquired from the environment (e.g., flora) or as the result of eating raw, undercooked, or old meat. Other risk factors include:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition, such as time spent outdoors, rummaging through garbage or getting hold of old or uncooked meat, or being boarded at a kennel.
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical exam on your dog as well as standard blood work, including a complete blood count, chemical blood profile, and urinalysis. Most of these tests will return normal. Because this infection has obvious intestinal symptoms, a fecal sample will need to be taken for microscopic analysis.
"
"This intestinal disease is sometimes difficult to identify because there is no one good test for it. Often, false positive results will return as the result of interfering substances in the feces. Your veterinarian may also want to use an endoscope to visualize the interior of your dog's intestines, and possibly take a tissue sample.
"
" 
"
"Treatment is generally simple, with outpatient care provided until your dog has recovered from the infection. In some cases, when diarrhea and/or vomiting has been severe and the animal has become dehydrated and low in electrolytes, fluid therapy will need to be administered.
"
"Your veterinarian may prescribe a week’s worth of oral antibiotics if the Clostridium perfringens toxin is found. Dogs that are being treated for long-term cases of diarrhea may need to be given antibiotics for a longer period of time.
"
"Dietary management is also helpful in the treatment of this condition. High-fiber diets and diets formulated with prebiotic and probiotic ingredients (like lactobacillus) can help to balance and maintain the intestinal flora of the gastrointestinal tract.
"
"This disease is treated and managed in long-term cases by switching your pet to a high in fiber diet, which reduces Clostridium perfringens and enterotoxin production in the intestinal tract. Your veterinarian might also recommend that you supplement your dog's high-fiber diet with psyllium, a soluble source of fiber. Prebiotic and probiotic diets might also be recommended by your veterinarian in order to try to maintain the normal balance of good bacteria in your dog's intestine.
"
"Fortunately, dogs with good immune response will generally fight off the infection easily.

"Hypercalcemia is defined as abnormally elevated calcium levels in the blood. Of the various types of substances that are poisonous to dogs, there are those that include hypercalcemic agents. Hypercalcemic agents contain vitamin D, medically known as cholecalciferol, which works by raising the calcium content in blood serum to high toxic levels, resulting in cardiac arrhythmias, and then death. Hypercalcemic agents are popular for use in rodent poisons, since rodents do not have resistance to cholecalciferol. In most cases, poisons containing cholecalciferol must be directly consumed by an animal for it to fall ill, however the exception to this is when a dog eats a poisoned rodent.
"
"Dogs that have consumed hypercalcemic poisons typically will not show immediate symptoms. Signs of poisoning may show 18 to 36 hours after the cholecalciferol containing poison was consumed. Left untreated, a dog can die from cholecalciferol poisoning and the resulting hypercalcemia. If the dog does survive, it will have elevated calcium levels for weeks after the poisoning, and this excess of calcium can lead to secondary health problems, like renal failure.
"
"The main cause of hypercalcemic poisoning is from the ingestion of rodent poison. If you suspect that your dog has come into contact with rat or mouse poison, and you are seeing some of the symptoms listed above, you will need to bring your dog to a veterinarian before your pet's health becomes critical.
"
"Keep in mind that outdoor dogs (or dogs that go outside frequently) are at risk of rodent poisoning. It might be in a neighbor's yard, in a trash bag, or in an alleyway. Dogs that engage in chasing and killing rodents may also be susceptible to this type of poisoning. Even if you do not live in an area where rats or mice are a concern, rodent poison may be used for other common suburban pests like raccoons, opossums, or squirrels.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account your pet's background medical history, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that precipitated this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, and a complete blood count. Your veterinarian will conduct a blood test to check your dog's calcium levels and presence of poison. If possible, you should take a sample of your pet's vomit with you to the veterinarian, so that it can also be examined for the presence of poison. If you have the poison that your pet ingested, you should take that to your doctor as well.
"
"One of the side effects of hypercalcemic poisoning is dehydration, which can lead to organ failure and seizures. You will need to make sure that your dog is getting plenty of water, and is able to retain the water it is taking in. Increased salt can help to increase or maintain body fluid, as well as induce excretion by the kidney. Adding a small amount of salt to the water you are giving to your pet will encourage fluid retention. Your veterinarian will work on correcting your dog's body fluids, electrolyte imbalances, and lowering the calcium levels using diuretics, prednisone, oral phosphorus binders, and a low calcium diet.
"
"Dogs that have survived hypercalcemic agent poisoning may succumb to some long term side effects due to the high level of calcium in the blood and in the body's organs. The kidneys, for instance, are commonly damaged as a result of hypercalcemia.
"
"The best prevention is to keep rodent poisons placed in areas that are not accessible to your dog, and to supervise your pet so that it does not get a hold of a rodent that may have ingested poison containing a hypercalcemic agent.

"It can be scary when your dog is shaking or trembling, and you don’t know why. Dogs may display muscle trembling for several reasons. Some of these are relatively simple and easy to fix, such as being cold. Others may be more involved and require diagnostics and treatment.
"
"Involuntary muscle trembling involves shaking or trembling movements of the whole body or a single part of the body, like the head. Sometimes the trembling is constant, and other times it can come and go. Because there are so many different things that can cause involuntary muscle trembling, it is a relatively common condition.
"
"While most cases of muscle trembling are not emergencies, there are some notable exceptions, like when exposure to a toxin is a possibility.
"
"If your dog has been exposed to any toxins, it is important that you get them to an emergency center as soon as possible or call the Pet Poison Helpline at 855-764-7661 to discuss next steps.
"
"Symptoms of involuntary muscle trembling in dogs include:
"
"Shaking
"
"Trembling movements across a dog’s body
"
"Shivering
"
"Head bobbing
"
"Rhythmic, repetitive muscle movements
"
"There are various causes of involuntary muscle trembling in dogs, and their severity can be very different. Causes of muscle trembling can be broken into several categories:
"
"Anxiety, fear, and excitement are all common causes of involuntary muscle trembling in dogs. If your dog is worried about something—perhaps there’s construction in the neighborhood or your smoke detector keeps making high-pitched chirps—it can lead to anxiety-related trembling.
"
"Excitement can also lead to trembling. Perhaps you’re getting ready to take your dog on a walk or have company over. Extreme excitement can also lead to involuntary whole body muscle trembling.
"
"Fear can also cause trembling. You may notice your dog trembling when at the vet or in a new situation where they are scared and uncomfortable.
"
"Pain, nausea, cold, and fever are some of the more common causes of trembling related to discomfort. Senior dogs that have mobility issues and arthritis may tremble in their back end when trying to stand on slick floors with poor traction or after standing for a while when their muscles fatigue.
"
"Sometimes dogs with stomach aches or nausea may tremble. Trembling is often seen before a dog begins to have diarrhea or vomiting, because of a combination of abdominal pain, nausea, and worry about what’s to come.
"
"Sometimes dogs are simply cold. Small-breed dogs with a short hair coat may chill quickly and tremble as a result. Fevers can also lead to trembling.
"
"Like people, dogs may feel very cold when they have a high fever.
"
"Many toxins can cause trembling in dogs. Because of this, if you believe your dog has had exposure to a toxin, it’s important that you get them to a veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"Insecticides and pesticides, like snail bait, can cause muscle trembling when eaten or licked. Let your veterinarian know if you have recently sprayed your garden and your dog had access to these chemicals.
"
"Marijuana, chocolate, and xylitol (a sweetener that is often found in chewing gum and causes low blood sugar) can also lead to trembling. Compost can contain tremorgenic mycotoxins and lead to involuntary tremors when eaten.
"
"Little white shaker syndrome, episodic head tremors, cerebellar hypoplasia, and seizure disorders can all lead to trembling. Many of these conditions more commonly affect certain breeds.
"
"Little white shaker syndrome is more common in small-breed dogs weighing less than 30 pounds. While it’s more often seen in Maltese, Miniature Poodle, and West Highland White Terrier breeds, it can occur in dogs of any color. Affected pups develop a tremor that can be subtle or severe, often in early adulthood.
"
"Episodic head tremors, known as idiopathic head tremor syndrome (IHTS), is a condition seen more commonly seen in English Bulldogs, Doberman Pinschers, Boxers, and Pit Bull-type breeds that results in head bobbing episodes, usually with up and down movements.
"
"Cerebellar hypoplasia and cerebellar abiotrophy are diseases that affect the cerebellum, the part of the brain that helps with regulating movement and balance.
"
"Dogs affected with cerebellar disease tend to have jerky, uncoordinated movements and have trouble walking.
"
"Cerebellar hypoplasia is usually inherited and noticed when dogs first start to walk and play as young puppies. This disease is more commonly seen in the Boston Terrier, Chow Chow, and Bull Terrier breeds.
"
"While cerebellar hypoplasia is inherited and shows up in very young puppies, cerebellar abiotrophy is a breakdown of the cerebellum and can occur in dogs of any age.
"
"Cerebellar abiotrophy is usually progressive and worsens over time.
"
"Seizure diseases, like epilepsy, can also lead to involuntary muscle trembling. Most dogs that experience seizures lose consciousness and will have grand mal episodes, where they fall on their side, paddle their legs, and lose control of their bladder or bowels.
"
"Occasionally dogs may experience more subtle, or petit mal, seizures, where they have less severe signs, and involuntary muscle trembling may be a sign of a seizure disorder.
"
"Some dogs, like Dachshund and Basset Hound breeds, may be prone to a myoclonic seizure disorder called Lafora disease, where they have sudden muscle twitches and jerky head movements that may or may not progress to full-fledged, whole-body seizures.
"
"Hypoglycemia means low blood sugar.
"
"This can occur in small-breed dogs who have not eaten in a while, dogs with diabetes who got too much insulin, or even secondary to a toxin ingestion, as seen with xylitol. When dogs experience hypoglycemia they may have weakness, tremors, or even seizures.
"
"Hypocalcemia is the term for when there is too little calcium in the bloodstream. Calcium is needed for most of the important functions in a pup’s body. When calcium becomes dangerously low, it can lead to shaking, trembling, or even death.
"
"Hypocalcemia can occur in pregnant or nursing dogs (referred to as eclampsia) or in dogs with disease of their parathyroid glands.
"
"Hepatic encephalopathy is a neurologic condition that can develop because of a poorly functioning liver. This is most seen in animals with shunts that divert normal blood flow away from the liver. When it’s not getting the blood flow it needs to function, the liver is not able to detoxify things like ammonia and clear these compounds from the bloodstream.
"
"This can lead to a dog seeming out of it, being unsteady on their feet, and experiencing muscle trembling and even seizures. These episodes are most seen shortly after they eat a meal, and the condition is more commonly seen in Yorkshire Terriers.
"
"Canine distemper is a very contagious viral disease that is spread from infected dogs or wildlife. This disease attacks the respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, and nervous system of infected dogs.
"
"Affected dogs usually have green-yellow drainage from their eyes, a fever, cough, and vomiting. They can develop muscle tremors and seizures once the virus gets into their nervous system, and they usually have rough, thickened pads on their feet.
"
"Fortunately, there are very good vaccines for canine distemper. Most puppies are vaccinated for a full series of three to four DAPP (distemper, adenovirus, parvovirus, and parainfluenza) vaccines when they are young, with the last vaccine given after they are 16 weeks of age.
"
"Your veterinarian will give a vaccine booster every one to three years depending on your dog’s age and how many vaccines they’ve had in the past.
"
"Tetanus is a bacteria disease caused by Clostridium tetani bacteria getting into a wound, often a deep puncture wound.
"
"Affected dogs can develop rigid muscles and muscle tremors, usually about a week after the original injury happened. It’s important that any wounds your pup gets be thoroughly cleaned and checked by a veterinarian for therapy if needed.
"
"Involuntary muscle trembling is usually noted in a veterinary clinic during a physical exam. Your vet will likely want to run several tests to figure out the underlying cause.
"
"They will likely run bloodwork and may do X-rays. They may even recommend referral to a veterinary neurologist if an underlying primary neurologic disease is suspected as the cause.
"
"Your veterinarian will likely want to know the following information to best help your dog:
"
"Has your pup had exposure to any toxins (pesticides, insecticides, chocolate, xylitol, and any other nonfood items)?
"
"How long ago did the trembling episodes start?
"
"How often do they occur?
"
"How long do they last?
"
"Is there any pattern that you’ve noticed at home for when your pup has these episodes?
"
"Does your dog have access to compost?
"
"Has your dog had any recent wounds/injuries?
"
"Is your pup showing any other unusual behaviors (like a cough, vomiting, poor appetite, or weakness)?
"
"Is your dog pregnant or have they had puppies recently?
"
"Sometimes trembling episodes are inconsistent and occur occasionally.
"
"In these cases, it is very helpful if you can bring a video of your dog shaking to show your veterinarian what they look like when the episodes happen.
"
"Treatment depends entirely on the underlying cause of your dog’s muscle trembling.
"
"If your pup is trembling because of an emotional issue like excitement or anxiety, it’s possible that no treatment will be needed. If the anxiety is severe or your dog’s quality of life is affected by chronic stress or fear, your vet may prescribe some antianxiety or mood-regulating medications like trazodone, Clomicalm®, or fluoxetine.
"
"If the trembling is related to pain, your dog may be prescribed pain medications to manage their discomfort if the source of the pain does not have a cure, like in the case of arthritis.
"
"Anti-inflammatories, like carprofen, may be paired with other pain medications like gabapentin. In severe cases, other pain control options may be recommended or explored, including new monthly injectable medications like Librela™ or physical therapy with underwater treadmills, cold laser therapy, and acupuncture. Your vet may also recommend joint supplements like Dasuquin® or regular injections of polysulfated glycosaminoglycans, like Adequan®, to lubricate painful joints.
"
"If the pain is related to gastrointestinal upset, nausea, or other internal issues, treatment will be  geared more toward visceral pain control and resolving the underlying problem.
"
"If your dog was exposed to a toxin, decontamination will be the first order of business.
"
"If ingestion occurred within the past four hours, your veterinarian may induce vomiting. Never induce vomiting at home without being directly told to do so by a veterinarian. Some toxins are caustic and can cause double the harm if they travel through the esophagus again.  
"
"Intravenous (IV) fluids may be given to flush the toxins from your dog’s body.
"
"They may give your dog activated charcoal to bind up any remaining toxins so that they can pass through your pup's body without causing further harm.
"
"Neurological disorders are treated differently, depending on the diagnosis. Dogs with little white shaker syndrome are often managed with steroids, while other conditions like cerebral hypoplasia and episodic head tremors can’t be treated.
"
"In dogs affected by tremor diseases that cannot be treated, pet parents must instead focus on management and keeping their dog comfortable. Sometimes that involves staying calm and distracting them during an episode, like in the case of episodic head tremors. Other times, that may mean avoiding slick footing with poor traction or access to stairs or other dangers to a dog with poor muscle control and balance.
"
"If your dog is having true seizures in addition to involuntary muscle trembling, your veterinarian may recommend antiepileptic medications based on the severity and frequency of the episodes.
"
"Other medical conditions leading to involuntary muscle trembling will be managed depending on which system is affected. Sometimes these treatments are simple, while other times they are complicated and may require time in the veterinary hospital.
"
"A dog with hypoglycemia may simply be treated with oral glucose (by eating a meal or rubbing sugary Karo syrup on their gums). Or they may need hospitalization and IV fluids with dextrose sugar added until their blood sugars are regulated.
"
"Bacterial infections, like tetanus, are treated with antibiotics while doing supportive care until the antibiotics can clear the infection.
"
"Some conditions, like hepatic encephalopathy, may have a surgical treatment if liver shunts are the underlying cause.
"
"If your dog’s involuntary muscle trembling is emotion-related, consider counterconditioning, where you provide your dog with a task to do when they are stimulated by the trembling-inducing event.
"
"You can teach them to focus on you or give them a simple command like “sit” and reward them with a treat. Keeping their mind occupied with another safe, routine task may help distract them from the emotionally charged situation.
"
"If it’s safe and practical to do so, desensitization therapy may also be helpful. This involves exposing your dog to the source of their anxiety in very small doses, with lots of rewards and positive experiences surrounding the training episode.
"
"If your dog’s involuntary muscle trembling is related to orthopedic pain, make sure they are in a good, healthy body condition. Each pound your dog is overweight will likely increase the amount of joint pain they experience. Working on getting them to a healthy weight will help their joints and overall quality of life.
"
"Sometimes this can be done with diet, either by limiting the amount of food fed or by changing to a lower-calorie diet. Prescription diets like Hill's® Metabolic and Mobility  may be helpful. Speak to your vet before changing your pup’s diet.
"
"Other times, exercise can be used to improve your dog’s health. Remember, if they are experiencing pain-related muscle trembling, rest may be needed. Low-impact exercise, like swimming or long slow walks, may be recommended.
"
"Talk to your veterinarian before starting any exercise programs.
"
"If your dog is diagnosed with a condition that will require lifelong management and some trembling episodes can be expected, consider making your home safer for your dog.
"
"Add nonslip runners to long hallways or carpets to rooms that have hardwood or tile flooring. Put up child gates at the top or bottom of stairwells to avoid your pet falling on the stairs.
"
"Many of the medical conditions that cause involuntary muscle trembling are not preventable, but some are.
"
"Making sure your pet does not have access to any toxins is something all pet parents should do. Keep rodenticides, insecticides, and other chemicals in latched or unreachable cabinets.
"
"Keep food items in pantries and on high shelves that your dog cannot get to. Make sure compost piles are fenced and/or outside your dog’s accessible outdoor space.
"
"Avoid letting your dog roam unsupervised.
"
"Keep your dog at a healthy weight and consider joint supplementation when they are middle-aged. Avoid letting them get into the trash or feeding fatty table scraps that can upset the stomach and pancreas.
"
"If your dog is diagnosed with an underlying inherited medical condition, like a neurologic disorder or liver shunts, don’t breed them.
"
"Keep your dog up to date on all vaccinations (like canine distemper virus) and give any wounds veterinary care right away to prevent tetanus.
"
"Worry about muscle twitching in dogs when it develops suddenly and is persistent. It is especially concerning if the muscle twitching comes with any other signs, like lethargy (lack of energy), vomiting, or weakness.
"
"A myoclonic seizure looks like a sudden onset of muscle twitching or jerking movements in a dog’s body. It can be in just a single part of the body, like the head, or affect the whole body.

"Zika is all over the news these days. While evidence that the virus is linked to severe birth defects in some babies is understandably alarming, getting an accurate picture of all the virus’s effects is important.
"
"Zika virus is transmitted primarily through Aedes aegypti mosquitos. A mosquito bites a person carrying the Zika virus (who may or may not have symptoms) and when it subsequently bites someone else, passes the virus on to this person. Evidence is mounting that Zika can also be transmitted through sexual intercourse. The virus has been found in saliva, but whether it can be passed through contact like kissing is not known.
"
"Most people who are infected with Zika do not become sick. The 1 in 5 people with Zika who do fall ill generally report symptoms like headaches, light sensitivity, joint pain, rashes, and eye inflammation.
"
"Zinc is one of the most important minerals for maintaining a healthy body, but excessive zinc can be harmful and can cause toxicity. More commonly referred to as zinc toxicity, it occurs when animals ingest an exorbitant amount of zinc-containing materials. Though mostly reported in small breed dogs, zinc toxicity can affect dogs  of all sizes.
"
"Ingestion of zinc-containing materials, such as:
"
"Your veterinarian will take a detailed history of your dog, including any incident of ingestion of unusual materials which may have precipitated the symptoms. He or she will also perform a complete physical examination on the animal. Routine laboratory tests include biochemistry profile, electrolytes, urinalysis, and a complete blood count. The complete blood count may reveal anemia due to zinc-related destructions of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) with possible formation of Heinz bodies, or granules present in the red blood cells. The complete blood count may also reveal variations in red blood cells coloration known as polychromasia.
"
"The biochemistry profile, meanwhile, may reveal abnormally high levels of hemoglobin and bilirubin in blood. If biochemistry profile shows derangements -- like high levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver enzymes, and pancreatic enzymes -- it will indicate multiple organ failure, which is not a good sign.
"
"While examining your dog's blood, the veterinarian may also note abnormal red blood cells with an unusual dark ring surrounding a dark center known as target cells; this is associated with anemia.
"
"Due to rapid destruction of red blood cells, your veterinarian will administer a test called packed cell volume (PCV), which will calculate the number of viable red blood cells. This test is important in determining whether a blood transfusion is required.
"
"To confirm the diagnosis, however, your veterinarian will order laboratory tests to measure the levels of zinc in your dog's blood. These tests can also help evaluate your dog's blood clotting mechanism, an indicator of zinc toxicity. In addition, X-rays are often used to confirm if your dog has ingested zinc-containing materials.
"
"
"
"To prevent further damage, removal of the object is imperative. To maintain the bodily fluid levels as well as promote urination, intravenous fluid therapy is initiated. Drugs to lower the stomach acidity and promote the release of zinc will also be instituted. In case of severe red blood destruction, blood transfusions may be required.
"
"Prompt treatment is crucial in saving the life of a dog with zinc toxicity. Subsequent check-ups will be required to monitor the health of the patient and to evaluate the progress of therapy through laboratory testing.
"
"Often, the levels of zinc in the blood drop quickly once the source is removed. However, dogs with severe complications like multiple organ failure have poor chances of survival.

"But, strong evidence now exists linking Zika virus infection in pregnant women and the birth of babies with microcephaly (abnormally small heads and brain defects) and eye abnormalities. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has found the virus in the brains of two babies from Brazil that died of microcephaly.
"
"People in the United States have been diagnosed with Zika, but all of them have recently travelled overseas to endemic areas. In the western and northern parts of the U.S., large outbreaks of Zika are extremely unlikely since the climate is too cold and dry and Aedes aegypti mosquitos are not prevalent. People living in the southeastern part of the U.S. are most at risk for a Zika outbreak.
"
"Treatment for Zika virus is limited to symptomatic care. There is no form of direct treatment for babies born with birth defects resulting from Zika virus infection. A vaccine is not available. The best forms of prevention in endemic areas are aggressive measures to prevent mosquito bites (keeping windows closed or screened, using nets over sleeping areas, wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts, using mosquito repellant, environmental control measures, etc.).
"
"Talk to your doctor if you are planning to travel to a Zika-endemic part of the world and consider postponing your trip if you will or might be pregnant at the time.
"
"We know very little about the possible effects of Zika in pets or livestock. The virus causes only relatively mild illness in a fraction of people bitten by an infected mosquito, and it seems likely that a similar outcome would be seen in animals.
"
"At this point, mosquito control measures and the use of repellants labeled for animals are the best preventative measures available should you have to travel to a Zika endemic area with your pet or if natural transmission through mosquito bites does become a problem locally in the future.
"
"To my knowledge, there have been no reports of illness or birth defects related to Zika virus infection in animals. That does not necessarily mean that it does not occur, however. It simply means that the research has not been done. 
"
"Interestingly, a virus that is related to Zika (Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus, or BVDV) is known to cause birth defects in calves, including microcephaly and eye deformities, when their mothers are infected during pregnancy.

"Itchy skin on a dog, also called pruritus, is a symptom of many different conditions. If your dog is itchy, they may scratch, bite, or lick an area repeatedly, or it may seem like their whole body is itchy.
"
"Not only is this nonstop itching uncomfortable for your dog, but it can cause infections if your dog keeps scratching and licking. Here’s what you need to know.
"
"If your dog has hives, a swollen face, lips, or eye, or is panting excessively, see your vet immediately. These could be signs of a severe allergic reaction.
"
"Other than scratching, you may see these signs of itchy skin in dogs:
"
"Licking
"
"Biting
"
"Rubbing
"
"Hair loss
"
"Oozing, inflamed skin
"
"Stench
"
"If your dog’s skin is oozing or inflamed, or if you smell a strong stench, you also need to see the vet, because these are signs of infection.
"
"There are several possible reasons why your dog is excessively itching. Common reasons may include:
"
"Bacterial or fungal infections: Bacterial or fungal infections are a common cause of pruritus, with other symptoms including oozing, inflamed skin, a strong stench, and hair loss.
"
"Atopic dermatitis: Also called allergic dermatitis, this is often caused by an allergen from the environment, such as from pollen, dander, and plants, so it can be seasonal.
"
"Flea allergy dermatitis: This is a type of allergic dermatitis that occurs when fleas inject saliva into a dog’s body. The proteins within the saliva trigger the immune system, causing itching that typically lasts several days. Even one flea bite can cause a reaction.
"
"Food allergies: Food allergies are often seen in dogs with year-round itching, and allergic reactions can be tested through a diet trial.

"Free for Chewy customers, exclusions apply. Virtual consults are supplementary to in-office visits. Our telehealth team does not prescribe, treat, or diagnose.
"
"Your vet will likely recommend a range of testing options, including skin scrapings and blood tests, to determine the underlying cause for itching in your dog.
"
"Skin cytology (scrapings): This test involves analyzing a tissue sample under a microscope. The vet will look for mites or infections from bacteria or fungus, such as ringworm.
"
"Intradermal testing: In this test, a veterinarian pricks the skin with a small amount of allergen. If the area swells after a half-hour, it means your pet is allergic to that substance.
"
"Radioallergosorbent test (RAST): A blood test used to identify environmental allergens such as pollen.
"
"Xylitol is a natural sugar alcohol, which is a type of carbohydrate that does not actually contain alcohol. It has a sweet taste and is often used as a sugar substitute.
"
"Xylitol, also known as birch sugar, is found in:  
"
"Sugar-free foods: Baked goods/desserts, peanut butter, ice cream, candy, fruit drink, drink powder, jelly/jam, cereal, pudding/Jell-O, ketchup, syrup, chewing gum, and breath mints 
"
"Medications: Cough drop, gummy vitamin, chewable vitamin, and prescription medication  
"
"Dental care products: Toothpaste and mouthwash 
"
"Beauty products: Shampoo, moisturizer, and deodorant 
"
"While xylitol may be unharmful to humans, it is toxic and potentially lethal to dogs. The difference is in the way blood sugar is controlled in the body.
"
"In both humans and dogs, blood sugar is regulated by the release of insulin from the pancreas. In dogs, xylitol triggers a large release of insulin which causes the blood sugar level to drop quickly and dangerously; this is called hypoglycemia. In humans, however, xylitol does not affect the pancreas or insulin release, so people do not experience any change in blood sugar levels.   
"
"Xylitol can also cause liver damage and even liver failure in dogs. It is unknown how this happens, but it appears to depend on how much xylitol your dog consumes.  
"
"Xylitol’s toxic effects are not yet reported in cats. Scientists, however, are not in agreement that cats are completely clear from the effects of xylitol poisoning, so for now it is best to keep xylitol products away from all your furry pets.  
"
"If your dog ingests xylitol, you should take it immediately to a local veterinary emergency hospital for evaluation and treatment.
"
"Food trial: If food is a suspected allergen, then a vet may suggest a prescription diet (or food cooked at home) without any additional treats. If itchiness subsides, then food may be the culprit.
"
"If you leave itchy skin in dogs untreated, it may lead to new problems, such as hot spots, which are areas of inflamed skin caused by excessive licking and biting. Your pet will also be uncomfortable, and the only way to stop the itching is to see a vet to find and treat the cause.
"
"Over-the-counter treatments should only be given under the guidance of a veterinarian. Depending on the underlying condition, your vet may recommend one of the following options to help get the itching under control:
"
"Antibiotics: In the case of bacterial and fungal infections, antibiotics may be prescribed, often taking 21 to 30 days to fully clear skin infections.
"
"Insect control: Removing or limiting a dog’s exposure to insects can help in cases of allergic reactions to insect bites.
"
"Prescribed diet: If food allergies are suspected, your veterinarian may recommend a special diet. This may mean trial and error to find the right food.
"
"Steroid medications: Medications such as glucocorticoids are highly effective but can have side effects such as increased hunger and thirst; these medications are usually prescribed for short periods.
"
"Anti-itch medication: Cyclosporine, oclacitinib, and essential fatty acids are common medications prescribed to dogs for symptom management.
"
"Antihistamines: While using antihistamines for treating itchiness is common, studies have not established it as a reliably effective treatment for dogs.
"
"Dog shampoos: Your vet may recommend over-the-counter dog shampoos to help with itching in the short-term.
"
"Yes, stress can cause short-term itching in dogs. Taking your dog for a walk or playing with them may help relieve symptoms.
"
"In addition to following your veterinarian’s recommendation for treatment, bathing your dog can help, particularly if your dog has atopic dermatitis.
"
"Itchiness can be caused by infection or allergies in the air, such as pollen, dander, or plants. You may not be able to see the fleas, or a single flea bite could have caused the reaction. Taking your dog to the veterinarian will help rule out causes and provide the necessary care.

"Symptoms of xylitol poisoning in dogs are typically due to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and may include:  
"
"Vomiting  
"
"Weakness/Loss of balance  
"
"Stumbling/Lack of coordination  
"
"Lethargy/Depression  
"
"Tremors/Seizures  
"
"Collapse/Coma  
"
"Signs of hypoglycemia may appear as early as 30 minutes after xylitol ingestion but may be delayed up to 12 hours. If you notice any of these symptoms, and believe your dog may have ingested xylitol, contact your local veterinary emergency hospital immediately.
"
"Xylitol poisoning in dogs is usually caused by accidental ingestion of a product containing xylitol which is included in many foods and household products. Therefore, xylitol poisoning relatively common in dogs.  
"
"Xylitol is not always clearly labeled as such, so look for words such as “birch sugar” or “artificial sweetener” in a product’s ingredients list. If in doubt, call the Pet Poison Helpline or ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center for more information on a specific product, and if your pet needs treatment.   
"
"One of the most common causes of xylitol poisoning in dogs is ingesting sugar-free chewing gum, which dogs may find rummaging through a bag or purse. Be sure to keep all gum securely away from your pets.   
"
"A dog only needs to eat as little as 0.045 grams/pound. (0.1gram/kilogram) to experience hypoglycemia from xylitol ingestion. Liver damage occurs at a much higher dose of 0.11 to 0.22 gram/pound (0.25 to 0.5gram/kilogram). Most chewing gums contain 0.2 to 1.0 grams of xylitol per piece, which means only one piece of gum can cause low blood sugar in a 20-pound dog, and as few as 2 to 4 pieces of gum can cause liver damage and failure.   
"
"If you see your dog eat a product containing xylitol or suspect it may have eaten it, take your pet to a local veterinary emergency hospital immediately.
"
"The vet will ask for a thorough history of the incident, so it is very helpful to bring the packaging (or what is left of it) from the product your dog ingested. To diagnose xylitol poisoning, a vet will perform a physical exam to assess your dog’s mental and neurological status.
"
"A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis are likely recommended for a baseline evaluation. This includes checking your dog’s blood sugar and baseline liver values, which will need to be monitored for the next 72 hours to ensure there is no liver damage.   
"
"Dogs should be treated as soon as possible for xylitol poisoning.
"
"If your dog is not showing symptoms of poisoning, and the ingestion occurred fewer than six hours prior, your vet will likely induce vomiting.   
"
"Next, the vet will try to maintain your dog’s normal blood sugar levels, which may include IV fluids with dextrose supplementation. Your dog will likely be hospitalized overnight for observation and serial blood sugar will be monitored. It may also be given a liver protectant medication.
"
"Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are crucial in treating xylitol poisoning in dogs. Hypoglycemia may lead to seizures and coma, and severe liver damage may lead to liver failure. Overall, the prognosis is very good for dogs with only hypoglycemia, and who are treated promptly upon ingesting xylitol.
"
"Most dogs are hospitalized for observation for 12 to 24 hours. The pet’s bloodwork is rechecked to monitor Its liver values for 72 hours after ingesting xylitol. If the liver values are normal at that time, then there should be no long-term damage.   
"
"Reading product labels is one important way to prevent xylitol poisoning in dogs. Look for xylitol as an ingredient, also for products labeled as “sugar-free,” “no sugar added,” “diabetic friendly,” “reduced sugar,” or “birch sugar.” 
"
"If you are unsure about a product’s safety, don’t feed it to your pet. Peanut butter is often used as a treat or to administer medication to dogs, so be sure to select the kind that is safe for your dog.   
"
"Keep all xylitol-containing foods and household products away from your dog and in a secure place. Dogs are very clever and will find ways to get to these dangerous items.   
"
"Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can occur if a dog ingests as little as 0.045 grams. (0.1gram/kilogram). Liver damage can occur by ingesting 0.11 to 0.22gram/pound. (0.25-0.5gram/kilogram). This means that as little as one piece of gum can cause xylitol poisoning in a 20-pound dog.
"
"Xylitol is quickly absorbed, so you may see signs as early as 30 minutes, or they could be delayed for up to 12 hours. Clinical signs of xylitol poisoning in dogs include vomiting, weakness, stumbling/loss of balance, lethargy/depression, tremors/seizures, and collapse/coma.
"
"Seek emergency veterinary care if your pet has ingested a product with xylitol, or you suspect they have. Xylitol is contained in many foods and household products including baked goods, chewing gum/mint, medication, oral hygiene, and beauty products, and more. If you did not see your pet eating xylitol but notice issues such as vomiting, weakness, trouble walking, balance concerns, lethargy, seizures, collapsing, or a coma-like state, it is experiencing xylitol toxicity.  
"
"Ingestion of xylitol can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in dogs, and at higher doses it can also lead to liver damage and even failure. The mechanism of liver damage is unknown, but it can be fatal if untreated.

"Does your dog frantically itch their skin? Have you noticed a bad smell or greasy fur when you pet them?
"
"If so, they may have a yeast infection.
"
"Yeast are fungal organisms that normally live on a dog’s skin without causing problems. However, when a dog’s immune system weakens or an underlying health condition, such as hypothyroidism, is present, yeast can overgrow and cause an infection.
"
"The yeast that commonly causes skin infections in dogs is Malassezia, which grows on warm, moist areas of the skin. Yeast infections cause extreme itchiness and changes to the skin, such as thickening and discoloration over time.
"
"Yeast infections in dogs are common among pups of all ages.
"
"While yeast infections in dogs are not considered medical emergencies, they should be treated by a veterinarian immediately to prevent symptoms from worsening. If left untreated, yeast infections can cause extreme discomfort, which can lead to a decreased appetite and lethargy, necessitating prompt veterinary care.
"
"Because yeast infections typically develop secondary to an underlying illness or suppressed immune system, they are not contagious among dogs or to pet parents.
"
"Yeast infections can affect various areas of the skin, including the ears, skin folds, paws, armpits, vulva, and groin.
"
"Ears—Yeast infections of the ear—also referred to as yeast otitis—cause a thick, brown discharge and strong odor in the ear canal. Affected dogs repeatedly scratch their ears to try to relieve the discomfort. They may also shake their heads and develop a head tilt. Ear infections are commonly related to food allergies.
"
"They are also more common in dog breeds with long ears, such as Cocker Spaniels, Labrador Retrievers, and Basset Hounds.
"
"Skin—Yeast dermatitis refers to a yeast infection anywhere on the skin. Affected dogs have a musty odor, greasy coat, flaky or thickened skin, and hair loss. They tend to lick the affected areas of the body, which leads to brown discoloration of the skin over time.
"
"Dermatitis, which is often due to allergies or a suppressed immune system, can affect a dog’s skin folds, armpits, vulva, and groin.
"
"Paws—Yeast infections that affect the paws are generally related to environmental allergies, such as allergies to grass or pollen. Dogs constantly chew or lick their itchy paws, which leads to brown discoloration between the paw pads. Over time, open sores can develop on the paws.
"
"Signs of yeast infections in dogs can vary depending on what area of the body is affected.
"
"Symptoms of yeast otitis may include:
"
"Shaking of the head
"
"Scratching of the ears
"
"Thick, brown ear discharge
"
"Red, inflamed ear canals
"
"Strong odor
"
"Symptoms of yeast dermatitis may include:
"
"Itchy skin
"
"Small, red bumps on the skin
"
"Brown discoloration of the skin
"
"Frequent licking or chewing of the affected area
"
"Greasy hair coat
"
"Thickened skin
"
"Strong odor
"
"Symptoms of a yeast infection affecting the paws may include:
"
"Licking and chewing the paws
"
"Brown discoloration of the skin and fur
"
"Red, moist areas between the paw pads
"
"Yeast is opportunistic, which means that although it is naturally present on the skin, it can cause an infection when conditions are favorable.
"
"Yeast infections in dogs can develop if a pup has a weak immune system or an underlying health condition. Underlying environmental or food allergies can predispose dogs to developing yeast infections.
"
"Skin parasites, including fleas and mites, can cause dogs to repeatedly itch their skin, which disrupts the normal skin barrier, making an infection more likely.
"
"Some breeds—such as Pit Bulls, Boxers, and Cocker Spaniels—are more frequently affected by yeast infections.
"
"A vet may use several tests to diagnose a yeast infections in dogs.
"
"First, they will gather a through medical history, including when the symptoms started, if your pet is taking any medications, and if they have previously been diagnosed with any health conditions.
"
"Next, your veterinarian will perform a full physical exam to check your dog’s overall health. They may also perform blood work to check for any abnormalities.
"
"Additional tests will depend on what your veterinarian finds during the initial exam, but may include the following:
"
"Tape impression—During this test, your vet presses a piece of clear tape to the affected area of skin to collect a sample. It’s then stained and examined under a microscope to identify yeast.
"
"Cytology—A cotton swab is used to collect a sample from the affected area, and it is then rubbed gently onto a microscope slide. The sample is then stained and examined under a microscope to look for yeast.
"
"Culture—A sterile cotton swab is used to collect a sample from the affected area. It is then sent to a lab to identify the type of organism present.
"
"Skin biopsy—For chronic infections or those that are unresponsive to treatment, a small sample of skin can be taken and sent to a lab for a more accurate diagnosis.
"
"Treatment for yeast infections in dogs will depend on the location and severity of the infection. Yeast dermatitis is often treated with antifungal medications and prescription shampoos.
"
"If the infection affects only one area, a topical medication may be all that is needed. For more widespread infections, oral medications and frequent bathing can help resolve the issue.
"
"Yeast otitis is typically treated with topical antifungal medications and steroids to reduce inflammation. Your veterinarian may recommend that you use a medicated ear wash prior to instilling ear medications.
"
"Paw yeast infections may benefit from medicated antifungal wipes and oral medications, a topical mousse, including antifungals and steroids.
"
"Because yeast infections in dogs often develop secondary to another health condition, they will not resolve without veterinary treatment.
"
"Determining the underlying cause of the yeast infection and treating it accordingly improves treatment success. For example, if your dog has an underlying food allergy, an accurate diagnosis and treatment can help their skin improve.
"
"It can take a few weeks to a few months for a yeast infection to fully resolve, depending on the severity. Most dogs start to feel relief from their symptoms in a week or two, but it can take several additional weeks for a pet parent to notice significant improvement to their skin and coat.
"
"Ensuring your dog receives regular preventive care and vaccinations keeps them healthy and less likely to develop infections.
"
"Additionally, health conditions that can lead to yeast infections in dogs can be caught and managed early during routine wellness visits.
"
"Most of the food ingredients that cause allergies in dogs are proteins. Chicken is the most common food allergen related to yeast infections.
"
"If a dog’s yeast infection is left untreated, it will progressively worsen and lead to extreme discomfort. Over time, the discomfort can cause the dog to become very sick.
"
"Unless the yeast infection is due to an underlying food allergy, it’s generally fine to continue your dog’s usual diet. However, it is best to follow your veterinarian’s recommendations when deciding what to feed your dog.

"Xanthine is a naturally occurring by-product of purine metabolism. It is normally converted to uric acid (the waste product of proteins found in the blood) by the enzyme xanthine oxidase and passed out of the body via urine, but because xanthine is the least soluble of the purines excreted into the urine, excessive amounts of xanthines may be associated with formation of xanthine uroliths (stones). Impairment of xanthine oxidase ultimately results in xanthines in the blood (hyperxanthinemia) and xanthines spilling over into the urine (xanthinuria). It may be naturally occurring, as with enzyme deficiency, or drug-induced (allopurinol). Xanthinuria can be a congenital or an acquired disease.
"
"In naturally occurring xanthinuria, a familial or congenital defect in xanthine oxidase activity is likely. In Cavalier King Charles spaniels, an autosomal (non-sex-linked) recessive mode of inheritance has been supposed to occur.
"
"Acquired xanthinuria is a common complication in dogs that are being treated with the drug allopurinol for urate urinary tract stones or leishmaniasis (a parasitic infestation). Consumption of high purine diets (high protein) also increases the risk of xanthinuria in patients that are being treated with allopurinol.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible prior conditions that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The urinalysis will show xanthine crystals in the urine sediment.
"
"These crystals cannot be distinguished by light microscopy alone. For a precise diagnosis, the urine should be sent for infrared spectroscopy, which can be used to differentiate xanthine uroliths (urinary tract stones) from other types of uroliths. Also, high-pressure liquid chromatography of urine can be done to detect xanthine, hypoxanthine, and other purine metabolites.
"
"Ultrasonography, double-contrast cystography, and intravenous urography are some additonal diagnostic tools that can aid in detecting uroliths and the location they are originating from. Uroliths generally do not show up on normal X-rays.
"
"Xanthine uroliths in the urethra and bladder stones near the urethra may be detected by urethrocystoscopy, which uses a small flexible tube that is equipped with a camera and can be inserted into small spaces, in this case, the urethral passage. Small uroliths may be retrieved for analysis by removing fluid using a transurethral catheter, or using a method called voiding urohydropulsion. This latter method involves filling the bladder completely while the patient is anesthetized, and then emptying the bladder, after attempting to shake stones into the urethra, so that the stones can be collected.
"
"
"
"Voiding urohydropulsion is effective for removing the smaller xanthine uroliths that will easily pass through the urethra, but surgery is still the best way to remove larger uroliths from the lower urinary tract. Perineal urethrostomy surgery may minimize recurrent urethral obstruction in male dogs.
"
"Urine pH may be increased to prevent xanthine uroliths, and a low-purine diet may be fed along with plenty of water to increase urine output. Depending on your dog's overall health and the severity of the condition, your veterinarian may also recommend a diet that is designed for dogs suffering from renal failure. The goal is to reduce the amount of ingested purine, along with reducing the formation of acid urine, in addition to increasing the amount of urine that is voided from the bladder so that the passages remain clear of stone forming chemicals.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule monthly follow-up appointments for your dog in order to conduct urinalysis, contrast X-rays, or ultrasonography exams. Your dog's treatment may be adjusted to how well its health is progressing since the initial treatment.

"Normally, the electrical impulse causing the heart to beat begins in the sinoatrial node -- the pacemaker of the heart located in the right atrium (one of the heart's top two chambers) -- is transmitted to the ventricles (the heart's bottom two chambers) and then passes through the atrioventricular (AV) node into the AV bundle. Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW) is when ventricular pre-excitation occurs as impulses originating in the sinoatrial node or atrium activate a portion of the ventricles prematurely through an accessory pathway without going through the AV node, causing, among other things, an abnormally fast heart beat rhythm (supraventricular tachycardia). (The remainder of the ventricles is activated normally through the usual conduction system.) 
"
"WPW syndrome can be associated with congenital or acquired heart defects.
"
"Congenital Heart Disease
"
"Acquired Heart Disease
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel -- the results of which are typically normal. Echocardiography, meanwhile, may show structural heart disease often associated WPW syndrome.
"
"
"
"If your dog is suffering from ventricular pre-excitation but does not have tachycardia, no treatment is needed. However, those with WPW syndrome will require conversion by dirrect shock (the most effective treatment) or by ocular or carotid sinus pressure, or drugs.
"
"Catheter ablation with radiofrequency current is a relatively recent technique that allows accessory pathways to be destroyed or ablated by a transvenous catheter positioned at the site of the pathway in the heart. It may be recommended due to the alternative: a lifelong therapy of drugs.
"
"The prognosis depends on the severity of the underlying cause. Most pets with WPW syndrome, however, respond well to therapy for supraventricular tachycardia.

"Wobblers Syndrome (or Wobblers, Wobblers disease) is a painful and debilitating neurologic disease in dogs that affects the spine in the neck or cervical region. This condition has about 14 different names in veterinary literature. The name most used is cervical spondylomyelopathy (CSM), a disease of the neck vertebrae that affects the spinal cord. Other common names are:
"
"Cervical vertebral instability (CVI)
"
"Cervical vertebral malformation (CVM)
"
"Cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation (CVMM)
"
"Cervical spondylopathy
"
"There are two forms of Wobblers: Disc-Associated Wobbler Syndrome (DAWS) and Bony-Associated Cervical Spondylomyelopathy (BACS).
"
"Dobermans and other large-breed dogs usually have the classic form of the disease characterized by disk herniations, while Great Danes have the typical form seen in Giant breeds (bony changes). Dobermans usually have the disease when they are middle-aged to older (mean age 6 years), whereas Great Danes are typically younger. Small breed dogs occasionally get the disease, but it is very uncommon.
"
"Any large or giant breed can develop the condition, but breeds that appear to be predisposed to Wobblers include:
"
"Borzoi, Rottweiler
"
"Mastiff
"
"Weimaraner
"
"Irish Wolfhound
"
"German Shepherd
"
"Bernese Mountain dog
"
"Swiss Mountain dog
"
"Basset Hound
"
"Spinal cord disorders in dogs cause a loss of motor function and coordination in the legs and/or a loss in their sense of position. Motor function is an activity or movement controlled by motor nerves. For both forms of Wobblers, signs can occur slowly, or they appear suddenly.
"
"Dogs with Wobblers typically have a “wobbly” gait mostly in the back legs. This wobbly gait may only be visible on slippery floors and when the dog walks slowly. They may walk with their head down, which is usually a sign of neck pain. In the more advanced stages of Wobblers, the symptoms become noticeable in all four legs. Dogs may have trouble getting up, appear very weak and even “buckle over” in the front legs. Approximately 5 percent of dogs with Wobblers may become suddenly paralyzed in all four legs.
"
"The most common clinical signs noticed in a dog with Wobblers Syndrome are:
"
"Strange wobbly gait
"
"Neck pain, stiffness, holding head down and crying when shaking head
"
"Weakness
"
"Short-stride walking, spastic or very weak in the front limbs
"
"Muscle loss near the shoulders
"
"Worn or scuffed toenails from uneven walking
"
"Increased extension of all four limbs
"
"Difficulty getting up from a lying position
"
"Partial or complete paralysis
"
"Veterinarians do not know exactly what causes Wobbler Syndrome.
"
"There is a genetic basis for the disease, but the evidence for genetics is still unclear. Nutrition has been suggested in some cases when Great Danes ingest too much protein, calcium and calories in their diet. However, nutrition does not appear to play a role in the development of Wobbler Syndrome in giant-breed dogs.
"
"If your dog appears to show any of these symptoms, especially difficulty walking — or any signs of neck pain—a trip to your veterinarian’s office is highly recommended. During the visit, your vet will obtain a complete medial history and perform both a physical and a neurological examination to see if the symptoms can be attributed to a neck/neurologic problem.
"
"A physical exam consists of taking a dog’s weight, body temperature, and heart rate, as well as the breathing rate, listening to the chest, and feeling the abdomen/belly. Your vet will assess range of motion in all joints and detect any abnormalities in the way that the dog walks/runs.
"
" A neurologic exam checks the following:
"
"Head and neck
"
"Cranial nerves - which help dogs taste, smell, hear and feel sensations; also help to make facial expressions, blink eyes and move tongue
"
"Gait - the way a dog walks and runs
"
"Front and hind legs
"
"Torso - main part of the body that contains the chest, abdomen, pelvis and back
"
"Anus – assessing muscle tone
"
"Tail
"
"Some baseline lab tests are performed, including bloodwork (complete blood count and chemistry panel), urinalysis and stool testing to rule out conditions causing similar symptoms.
"
"X-rays and myelogram (imaging done on the spinal canal) can help rule out other conditions such as diskospondylitis, tumors and inflammatory spinal cord disease. Advanced imaging such as an MRI or CT are preformed to visualize the spinal cord compression caused by the disc herniation or the bony changes.
"
"Typically, these tests are done by veterinary specialists in larger animal hospitals, universities or specialty clinics and require the dog be under general anesthesia to ensure complete stillness during exam.
"
"Treating Wobbler Syndrome depends on the location and severity of the problem. Cervical (neck) surgery is typically recommended for the best chance of improvement, but as with any surgery, there is always a risk of complications.
"
"For affected dogs in which surgery is not appropriate, medical management is another reliable treatment option. This can include:
"
"Anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids, such as Prednisone, or non-steroids, such as Carprofen) to reduce the pressure on the spinal cord and spinal nerve roots
"
"Pain medication
"
"Limiting activity for a period
"
"Medical management may be suggested for dogs with few clinical signs, dogs with spinal cord compression in several places or those that have other health concerns that make surgery risky. 
"
"Because dogs with this condition have a neck problem, neck leashes should not be used, and chest harnesses are strongly recommended. Dogs that are not able to walk should be kept on soft bedding and rotated frequently to avoid sores.
"
"Some dogs also require help emptying their bladder and their bowels on a regular basis if they are not able to do so on their own, because these are functions controlled by the affected nerves. Dogs with continuing signs that are not responding to medical management are advised to undergo surgery, if they are a good candidate. 
"
"The goal of surgery is to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and prevent further damage. It cannot correct damage that has already occurred and most dogs will never walk normally. However, the surgery can improve quality of life. As with any surgical procedure there are risks that your veterinarian will discuss with you depending on your dog’s diagnosis.
"
"Following surgery, activity should be restricted for at least 2-3 months to allow the spinal cord and the vertebral bones to heal.
"
"Other treatment methods are being investigated, including artificial disc replacement (the gold standard surgical treatment for people with a very similar disease called cervical spondylotic myelopathy).
"
"The prognosis for a dog with Wobblers depends on three factors: the severity of spinal lesions, neurologic damage and the type of treatment used.  
"
"For dogs unable to stand or walk, it is not clear how much a surgical intervention will help. Dogs with mild symptoms have a much greater chance of recovery. Even after surgery and medical management, some dogs with Wobbler Syndrome may never walk normally again. However, when combined with physical therapy and post-operative care, treatments can provide a significant chance of improving your dog’s general quality of life.
"
"It is not known yet what exactly causes Wobblers in dogs. Research indicates there is a genetic origin for the disease, but the evidence for genetics is still unclear.
"
"The average survival time of dogs with Wobblers is approximately four years. This survival is the same whether the dogs is treated medically or surgically.
"
"Even after both surgery and medical management, some dogs with Wobblers syndrome may never walk normally again.
"
"The estimated cost for spinal surgery alone in dogs in $1,500 to $5,000, which usually considers both the size of the dog and the extent of the spinal cord compression lesion(s). The total cost of the surgery/post-operative care, including the medical workup and diagnostic imaging can range from $5,000 - $10,000. Your geographical location will also affect costs as prices follow trends related to cost of living in your area.

"Dogs rely on their fur to protect their skin, help regulate body temperature, and insulate the internal organs from cold and heat. Like our own daily hair loss, some shedding is natural in pets. Some breeds of dogs and cats naturally shed more than others, especially during seasonal changes.
"
"But excessive shedding in dogs can be a sign of disease or illness that requires veterinary care. That’s why it’s important to determine the normal shedding pattern of your dog and know what to do if your dog is shedding a lot.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The amount of shedding that is “normal” for your pet depends on many variables, including breed, anatomy, physiology, and genetics, said Roy Cruzen, DVM in Phoenix. Ideally, a pet parent should determine their dog’s baseline shedding as soon as they bring home their new furry family member.
"
"The notion that long-haired dogs shed the most is a myth. In fact, short-haired dogs have denser coats and generally shed more—but the length of their hair makes it less noticeable.
"
"Of course, there are no hard and fast rules. But some dogs are just naturally heavy shedders, explains Cruzen.
"
"“Labrador Retrievers are shedding machines,” Cruzen says. “When a Lab comes into the vet clinic for 20 minutes, we have to immediately go in and vacuum. The floor is covered with hair.”
"
"Other high-shedding dog breeds include:
"
"Akitas
"
"Chow Chows
"
"Dalmatians
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Siberian Huskies
"
"If you notice your dog’s shedding more than usual, there are many reasons that could cause this.
"
"One of the first things to do if it occurs is to look at your dog’s hair. Does it have a healthy sheen? Does the skin beneath the fur appear normal, or is it flaky, dry, or discolored? If the hair is dull, dry, or broken, it can be a sign of an underlying medical condition and you should contact your veterinarian.
"
"Some dog breeds, especially those with double coats, shed a lot more seasonally, with peak shedding occurring in the early spring and early fall. Dogs may also shed more in response to temperature changes or the amount of sunlight they are exposed to.
"
"When the warmer months approach, dogs shed their winter undercoats for a lighter summer coat. When the colder months approach, dogs shed their lighter undercoats and grow thicker, warmer coats for winter.
"
"The number one reason for excessive shedding in dogs is a poor diet, Cruzen says. “People go to discount stores, buy a 40-pound bag of cheap food, and then see their pet’s shedding increase,” he says. “Even though the food meets the minimum quality requirements, it may not have enough protein or nutrients for your pet.”
"
"Choose a high-quality dog food that meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). The best food for your dog depends on their age, lifestyle, and health. Talking to your veterinarian will help you find the best fit.
"
"Food allergies or intolerance is a common cause of excessive shedding in dogs. This often causes itchy skin and skin infections, which will contribute not only to more shedding but also areas of total hair loss in these pups.
"
"Environmental allergies, such as those to pollen, grass, or dander, can also make your dog shed a lot, so it’s important to discuss your dog’s coat changes with your veterinarian before switching to an allergy-friendly dog food. The issue might not be their food!
"
"If your dog’s shedding a lot but you don’t believe food quality, a food intolerance, or food allergies are to blame, consider your grooming habits.
"
"Never use human shampoo on your dog. It’s too harsh on their skin and coat, and it can cause excessive shedding, flaking, and even skin infections. Bathe your dog with a dog-safe shampoo instead, and make sure to rinse it all out of your pup’s coat.
"
"Stress, such as a sudden change in routine or welcoming a new family member into the home, can also cause excessive shedding. You may also notice your dog shedding a lot during fireworks, thunderstorms, or even a trip to the vet. This is due to the body’s stress response.
"
"Although it’s not known exactly why dogs shed when they’re stressed, it’s suspected to be due to epinephrine (aka adrenaline), which is the primary stress hormone in the body.
"
"If your dog is shedding more than usual and excessively scratching, they may have fleas, ticks, or mange mites. Those parasites—and the itching and scratching they cause—can lead to more serious health issues, including inflammation of the skin and secondary skin infections.
"
"All dogs should be on year-round flea and tick preventatives. Because these parasites can hitch a ride on clothing or come in through screened windows and doors, all pets at home—even indoor cats—need regular preventatives. Talk to your vet about the best flea and tick medications for your dog.
"
"Excessive shedding may also be a sign of hormonal imbalances. Some dogs shed excessively after giving birth or after spaying or neutering.
"
"Shedding on various parts of the body, clumps of shedding, and skin discoloration may also be signs of an array of serious issues, including: 
"
"Bacterial infections
"
"Ringworm and other fungal infections
"
"Thyroid disease
"
"Cushing’s disease
"
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
"
"Skin allergies
"
"If your dog’s shedding is leading to other issues, such as areas of hair loss or skin abnormalities, your dog should be examined by their veterinarian to help determine treatment. You should take your dog to the vet if your pup’s shedding has become excessive (outside of the high-shedding seasons of early spring or fall).  
"
"Take your dog to the vet if you notice any accompanying symptoms to the shedding, including:
"
"Increased thirst
"
"Increased urination
"
"Weight gain
"
"Noticeable parasites on the skin
"
"Excessive itching
"
"A trip to the vet is never a bad idea if you’re doubting whether your dog’s shedding is normal.
"
"Take your dog to the vet if they’re shedding heavily while exhibiting other symptoms such as total hair loss, itchy skin, skin lesions, and changes in their weight or temperament. These can be signs of an underlying medical issue.
"
"Dogs, especially dogs with thick double coats, tend to shed more in the early spring and early summer.
"
"While shedding cannot be totally stopped, routinely bathing and brushing your dog with a slicker brush, FURminator, or hand mitt can help remove dead hairs before they’re shed.

"Dog farting can be an unpleasant part of being a pet parent—the gaseous odors that emanate from your pup can be surprising and overbearing.
"
"In most cases, dog farting is harmless. However, excessive gas in dogs can be indicative of an underlying health condition that needs to be treated.
"
"Let’s look at everything you need to know about dog farting.
"
"Dog farting can be caused by a variety of reasons. From their diet to health issues, here’s a breakdown of a few of the more common reasons for gas in dogs.
"
"Many people are looking for ways to live a more natural lifestyle—and pet parents want to include their pets in this natural lifestyle as well.
"
"While your veterinarian will wholeheartedly support some of your efforts—by helping you pick out an all-natural, nutritionally complete, and balanced dog food, for example—they will want to address, educate, and discuss any treatments that could have serious health implications. 
"
"One natural approach they likely won't recommend is natural heartworm prevention. While you can find myriad online articles about common home remedies for heartworms, at the end of the day, prescription medication is the only option backed by science and proven effective.
"
"While there are natural ways to slightly decrease the likelihood that your dog will develop heartworm disease, none are effective enough to make skipping prescription heartworm preventatives a wise or safe decision. There are, however, natural or drug-free options that can be used in addition to preventatives.
"
"Since dogs contract heartworms through the bite of infected mosquitos, many common home remedies for heartworms involve making dogs less attractive to mosquitos.
"
"The problem is that while mosquito repellents may reduce the number of mosquito bites, they don’t completely eliminate all bites. Just think back to the last time you were slathered in mosquito repellent but still came home with a couple of itchy welts.
"
"Since one mosquito bite is all it takes for your dog to develop heartworm disease, ensuring fewer mosquito bites is not enough protection to be considered an effective, natural heartworm treatment.
"
"Other natural heartworm prevention methods focus on building up a dog’s immune system so that it’s better able to fight off a heartworm infection.
"
"Some of these approaches involve dietary changes or making sure your dog gets plenty of exercise. Your veterinarian will absolutely support a healthier lifestyle for your pup; however, a good diet and exercise regime is not going to protect your dog from heartworms.
"
"Just like with people, a stronger immune system can help reduce the chances of contracting illness, but individuals who “do everything right” still get sick every day. The same can be said about heartworm prevention methods that only uses vitamins or other supplements.
"
"Here are several compelling arguments for using conventional heartworm prevention.
"
"Like any medication, prescription heartworm prevention isn’t completely without risk. Side effects are possible, but most are quite mild and infrequent.
"
"A small number of dogs may experience diarrhea, vomiting, or lethargy after conventional heartworm prevention is administered. Seizures or other neurological complications are also possible with some classes of preventatives, as are allergic reactions. And while some serious reactions like these have occurred, they are very rare.
"
"What your dog eats can play a huge role in how their digestive tract functions. Here’s a list of the most common dietary culprits of bad gas in dogs:
"
"Change in diet
"
"Foods that are difficult to digest (soybeans, beans, etc.):
"
"Spoiled food
"
"High-fat diets
"
"Milk products
"
"Spices
"
"High-fiber foods
"
"Bacterial fermentation of nutrients, as in humans, does sometimes result in the noxious gases that escape from time to time.
"
"You may be surprised to find that the source of most gas in dogs comes simply from swallowing too much air.
"
"How do dogs swallow too much air, though?
"
"One of the causes is gobbling food, which may have to do with competing with another animal for food and then eating too quickly.
"
"A respiratory disease that causes an increased respiratory rate might be the problem, or feeding shortly after exercise before your dog has had an opportunity to slow their breathing.
"
"Disease may also play a part in causing a dog to fart a lot, such as acute and chronic intestinal ailments.
"
"When gastrointestinal disease is the cause, there are usually other symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting. Your dog may also suffer from a loss of appetite and weight.
"
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a possibility, as is bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. Neoplasia, cancer of the bowel, may also be a cause.
"
"Some other diseases that may cause excessive flatulence are food sensitivities/allergies, parasites, an inflammation of the intestine caused by a virus, or a failure of the pancreas to function normally.
"
"Breeds that have short heads—brachycephalic breeds—also tend to swallow a lot of air because of the positioning of their noses.
"
"Panting heavily, such as after playing or running, can also cause pups to swallow excess air.
"
"
"
"
"
"The gas produced by your dog can vary dramatically from nearly silent and odorless to loud and foul smelling. 
"
"There are several reasons for this, but usually is caused by either diet, or metabolism. 
"
"High-fiber foods take longer to digest, which then results in stronger smelling flatulence.  Some foods will contain sulfur, which result in gas that smells like rotten eggs.
"
"If your dog has a dietary intolerance (such as to lactose), the food may be fermented by bacteria in the gut, which also triggers a foul odor. 
"
"Certain dogs may be more sensitive to particular types of medications, like those with the MDR1 genetic mutation (also known as ABCB1), which is relatively common in herding breeds.
"
"However, FDA-approved heartworm medications are still very safe for these animals at the recommended dosages.
"
"Most adverse reactions to heartworm medications occur in cases of overdose. Therefore, keeping medications in a secure location and using them as instructed will likely prevent your pet from experiencing them.
"
"Many pet owners who seek out natural heartworm prevention for dogs do so because they’re trying to avoid exposing their pets to synthetic chemicals. But many of the active ingredients in conventional heartworm preventatives are derived from natural sources.
"
"Ivermectin (Heartgard, for example), milbemycin (Interceptor, for example) and moxidectin (Advantage Multi, for example) are compounds that come from the fermentation processes of organisms that live in dirt.
"
"The doses of the medications used in heartworm preventatives are also very small. For example, the dosage of ivermectin used for heartworm prevention is 0.0006 mg/kg, while up to 0.4 mg/kg can be used for the treatment of other parasitic diseases in dogs.
"
"The risks of conventional heartworm prevention are much smaller than those associated with leaving your dog open to developing a potentially fatal case of heartworm disease.
"
"Heartworm treatment is possible, but it is very expensive and involves the use of arsenical medications, which are far more dangerous than prescription heartworm preventatives.
"
"Talk to your veterinarian if you’re concerned about overmedicating your dog. They can help you develop a preventative heartworm plan that is safe for your pet.

"
"Similarly, bacterial infections and inflammation in the intestinal tract can result in excessive smell. 
"
"Anything that moves food too slowly or too quickly through the intestinal tract will result in gas that has a strong odor.
"
"Some gas is normal in dogs, so the occasional smelly fart isn’t anything to be overly concerned about. 
"
"However, if your dog has smelly gas and/or belly gurgling several times a week, or gas combined with vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of weight or appetite, then it’s time to discuss possible causes with your veterinarian.  
"
"You should also seek medical advice from your veterinarian if dog farting is accompanied by:
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Weight loss
"
"Lethargy
"
"Loss of appetite  
"
"Examining your dog’s diet and ruling out actual disease are the first steps in addressing flatulence. There are medications that can help if you feel that the problem is great enough to justify it.

"
"Dog farting can be unpleasant for everyone. A few tips for helping to minimize your dog’s gas include:
"
"Encourage an active lifestyle.
"
"Feed smaller meals more frequently.
"
"Feed meals in a quiet, isolated, noncompetitive environment.
"
"Make certain your dog’s diet is highly digestible—consider a GI-friendly dog food.
"
"Limit treats to those specifically made for dogs and that are low in fiber.
"
"Consider changing your pup's source of protein and carbohydrates. You should do this slowly, under the guidance of a veterinarian, as acute diet changes can lead to more of an upset stomach.
"
"Finally, be cautious about where your dog has access to food. Put secure covers on garbage cans and don't let your dog roam into the neighbors’ yards or into garages where trash might be stored.

"Although dogs may seem perpetually interested in food, an excessive appetite (called polyphagia or hyperphagia) may signal a more serious issue that should be examined by a veterinarian.
"
"If your dog is always hungry, they could have a problem with their metabolism, leaving them abnormally hungry, and they may be begging or whining even after eating.
"
"So how can you tell if your dog is just very interested in food or has an underlying problem?
"
"Here’s what to look for, possible causes, and when to see a vet.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"If your dog doesn’t have any other symptoms and appears to be fine other than wanting to eat all the time, schedule a vet visit within 1-2 weeks or at the earliest time available.
"
"Dogs that are suddenly hungrier than usual often have other symptoms. As a rule of thumb, any change in eating or bathroom habits should prompt a visit to the veterinarian.
"
"Call your vet if you see any of the following:
"
"Increased thirst and urination
"
"Vomiting or diarrhea
"
"Changes in weight (gain or loss)
"
"Changes in body shape, such as a growing potbelly and shrinkage of muscle
"
"Eating non-food items
"
"There’s no clear-cut cause for why a dog might be obsessed with eating. It could stem from a psychological issue, such as stress or learned behavior, or a medical issue, such as not getting the right nutrients or an underlying health condition.
"
"That’s why you’ll need your vet’s help in getting the root of the problem. They can perform tests and ask questions to rule out certain causes. Here are some of the most common causes of increased appetite in dogs:
"
"Psychological issues, such as anxiety or stress
"
"Learned behavior, due to poor nutrition (either fed too much or too little)
"
"Aging process (as dogs age, some will begin to crave food more)
"
"Medication, such as prednisone
"
"Metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and hypoglycemia
"
"Cushing’s disease (hyperadrenocorticism)
"
"Gastrointestinal disorders that interfere with nutrient absorption, which can include:
"
"Inflammatory bowel syndrome
"
"Cancer
"
"Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
"
"Parasites/infections that interfere with nutrient absorption
"
"Your veterinarian may want to run a range of tests to determine the underlying cause for the sudden increase in appetite. They will usually start with the least invasive tests to try to rule things out. Here are some diagnostics your vet may want to do:
"
"Complete medical history and physical examination
"
"Blood panels, such as a complete blood count
"
"Facial swelling in dogs is considered an emergency situation, because it’s possible for the swelling to move to the airway and cause trouble breathing. Seek immediate medical care if you see more serious symptoms of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock), such as difficulty breathing, signs of pain, lethargy, drooling, or dizziness.
"
"A dog’s face will swell when fluid builds up in the tissues. Dogs often get swollen faces from allergic reaction, but there are many other possible causes.
"
"Here are some possible causes of facial swelling in dogs, along with other symptoms to watch for, when to see a vet, and what to expect at the vet visit.
"
"Swelling on a dog’s face can be caused by many conditions, but it is most commonly due to dental disease or a reaction to an allergen.
"
"These are some typical allergens that can affect dogs:
"
"Dust and molds
"
"Foods
"

"
"For exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, your vet will recommend dietary changes and medications.
"
"Treatment for cancer can include chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatments.
"
"Yes. Sometimes this is due to underlying health conditions, such as diabetes mellitus or Cushing’s disease, or a medication they’re taking, like prednisone.
"
"Many conditions can trigger increased appetite in dogs. A dog may have learned the behavior because they were not properly fed or became anxious about food. Or, they may have developed a metabolic condition or infection or have parasites. Your vet will need to do an exam, ask questions, and do some tests to rule out certain causes.
"
"You should call your vet if you notice a sudden and dramatic change in your dog’s dietary habits.

"Gingivitis and gum (periodontal) disease
"
"Skin cancer (mast cell tumors are the most common cause)
"
"Oral cancers
"
"Retrobulbar cancer (space behind the eye)
"
"Injury
"
"One clue to figuring out the cause is identifying which part of your dog’s face is swollen:
"
"A swollen muzzle could be a sign of dental problems (periodontal disease). Other signs of periodontal disease usually include reddened gums, bad breath, and pain.
"
"With swollen salivary glands (a condition called sialocele), the neck and jaw area become swollen.
"
"Swelling around the eye (conjunctivitis) is usually accompanied by red eyes and watery discharge.
"
"Puffiness around the ears might be due to allergies. When swelling is due to an allergic reaction, other signs can include hives (raised skin areas called wheals), sneezing, and conjunctivitis.
"
"Swelling may occur in other parts of the face if the cause is from a tumor (such as mast cell tumors or oral masses)
"
"Swelling of the face or neck can cause trouble breathing and become an emergency situation. It’s always best to contact your vet for facial swelling in dogs or if your dog has hives that worsen or last longer than 24 hours.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a physical examination of your dog’s head and neck and check other areas of the body. They will ask questions about when it started, any medications, substances, or allergens your dog may have been exposed to, and your dog’s recent activities. They may recommend testing, including:
"
"X-rays: If periodontal disease is suspected, an x-ray may be taken of the jaw.
"
"Medications: Antibiotics may be given experimentally in suspected cases of abscess. A diagnosis may be made if the therapy succeeds in treating the abscess.
"
"Skin scraping: Tissue may be extracted (by skin scraping or fine needle aspiration) to test for tumors.
"
"Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): May be used in suspected cases of cancer or severe dental disease and facial fractures.
"
"The treatment depends on the underlying condition that’s causing your dog’s face to swell.
"
"Mild swelling may resolve on its own, but you still need a vet to check your pet out and determine why their face swelled up.
"
"If the cause is due to dental disease, treatments can range from cleaning to tooth removal.
"
"If an abscess has formed, antibiotics will be given to treat the infection, which will reduce the swelling.
"
"Allergic reactions will be treated by a range of therapies, depending on the severity:
"
"A simple cold compress to relieve itching for mild cases
"
"Glucocorticoids, a type of anti-inflammatory steroid
"
"Antihistamines (their usefulness in dogs has not been proven in studies)
"
"Intravenous fluids may be provided for very serious cases
"
"When the cause is due to injury or cancer, anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed to treat swelling while the underlying condition is addressed.
"
"Pain medication may also be prescribed for some causes.
"
"Do not try to treat the swelling without first immediately consulting your vet, because certain medications can be dangerous to a dog. Be prepared to provide information about your dog’s medical history and possible exposure to a triggering substance.

"Trichuris Vulpis, also known as whipworm, is a type of intestinal parasite that can infect dogs. The time between infection with the parasite and production of whipworm eggs by female worms is between 74 to 90 days. The duration between infection with parasite, and actual production of whipworm eggs, impacts how this parasite is treated. If treatment does not cover the reproductive cycle of the parasite, it will make it difficult to clear the infection.
"
"There are three stages in the life cycle of the whipworms, including the eggs, larvae and mature adult whipworms.
"
"Stage 1 Eggs: Whipworms eggs are released in the stool of an infected dog out into the environment. Over a period of 9 to 21 days, the eggs mature into an infective stage. This maturation process is impacted by the temperature and moisture of the soil, and eggs can survive in the environment for years.
"
"Stage 2 Larvae: Once the eggs are ingested by your dog, the larvae hatch from the eggs and attach to the mucosa (walls of the intestines). They remain there for a period of 2 to 10 days and continue to develop before moving on to a different part of the intestinal tract (cecum or sometimes colon area).
"
"Stage 3 Adult: The adult worms mainly reside in the cecum or colon areas of the large intestine where they consume blood, tissue, fluids and mucosal lining. After 70 to 90 days, the female adult worms produce eggs. Female worms can produce more than 2,000 eggs per day. The immature eggs are released in the dog's feces, and the life cycle continues. If a dog ingests infective whipworms eggs from the soil, it can become infected with the parasite.
"
"Some pets with whipworms may not show any clinical signs. The infection can be asymptomatic with low numbers of worms present. As the worm burden increases, there is more potential for inflammation and even hemorrhage into the cecum and colon.
"
"Clinical signs of whipworm include:
"
"Pet parents typically do not see whipworms in the stool, but if they were present, they would look like small pieces of thread with one end enlarged.
"
"Dogs become infected with whipworms by being in contact with infected soil. Whipworm eggs thrive in moist, warm soil but over time are susceptible to desiccation (drying out). The eggs can remain in the environment for several years. Unlike other intestinal parasites that can be transmitted by the placenta, breast milk or from an intermediate host, your dog would have to ingest the infective eggs from the soil to become infected.
"
"To diagnose this condition, your veterinarian will test your pet's fecal sample for the presence of whipworm eggs. The eggs, viewed under a microscope, will look like football-shaped eggs with caps on both ends. Whipworm eggs can be difficult to find in fecal samples because of the long reproductive cycle and the eggs are shed into the stool intermittently. They are heavier than other parasite eggs so different laboratory techniques may be needed.
"
"If none of the eggs are found in your dog’s fecal sample, but your veterinarian is still suspicious about possible whipworm infection, then a parasite antigen test can be performed. This is a test usually performed at an outside laboratory where the feces is tested for the presence of a protein associated with whipworms. The Companion Animal Parasite Council recommends fecal testing puppies at least four times per year, and adult dogs twice yearly to check for whipworms.
"
"There are various anthelmintic (deworming) medications available for treating whipworms. The most used is Fenbendazole. The medication is given once daily for three days and then repeated in three weeks and finally once again in three months. This is to make sure medications cover the long 70- to 94- day reproductive cycle of the whipworms.
"
"The other options for treatment include several of the monthly heartworm prevention medications that will treat and help prevent future whipworm infections
"
"After three months of treatment, your pet should be recovered from whipworms.
"
"Monthly prevention medications are important as they can help prevent and even treat whipworm infections. It is better for your pet’s health to try to prevent intestinal parasites than to have to treat these infections and have your pet deal with the underlying clinical signs.
"
"Common preventative medications include:
"
"If you are not able to keep your pet on a monthly preventive, it’s best to treat adult pets four times a year with a broad-spectrum dewormer.
"
"It is possible to see whipworms in your dog’s feces; however, they are not seen very often. They would look like thin pieces of thread.
"
"It takes three months to get rid of whipworms in dogs.
"
" Humans are not able to catch whipworms from dogs.
"
"Whipworms are not spread directly from dog to dog, but if your dog comes into an environment where another pet has released infective eggs (in their feces), then your dog can potentially become infected.

"Fleas and ticks pose more of a problem for dogs and cats in certain parts of the United States than in others. A climate where the environment is warmer and more humid allows populations of fleas and ticks to explode, causing serious health concerns for the cats, dogs, and humans in these locations.
"
" 
"
"The distribution of certain tick and flea species varies depending on an area's climate. Climates that experience colder winter seasons get some respite from dealing with ticks and fleas for a few months during the year, while hot, dry climates are less hospitable for fleas and ticks year round.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"In recent years, ticks that were more commonly found in the southern part of the country have started to expand their populations into northern areas. Ticks of the Ixodes and Amblyomma species are making their way to climates that were previously too cold for them. With warming temperatures, wildlife conservation programs, reforestation, and expansion of urban areas, tick migration is on the rise.
"
" 
"
"For example, the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) is finding its way to new locations with the help of a growing deer population in the eastern part of the United States. Along with the increasing population of deer ticks comes the increased likelihood of Lyme disease and/or anaplasmosis transmission to dogs and cats in that part of the country.
"
" 
"
"Because migrating tick populations bring with them potential diseases that have not been a problem in certain areas before, it's becoming increasingly more important to protect your pet from ticks. Using tick prevention medications, vaccinations, and having your pets screened for various tick-borne diseases is essential. Your veterinarian can provide the best advice as to which diseases are more prevalent in your area.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"The most common flea species affecting cats and dogs in the U.S. is Ctenocephalides felis, or the cat flea. While fleas may be found anywhere in the country, they are found in greater numbers in areas where higher humidity levels and warmer temperatures exist.
"
" 
"
"This is why you will see a major flea problem in Florida even in the winter, while in Chicago they become less active for a few months of the year. In the drier desert regions of the U.S., humidity levels are typically not high enough to support the flea life cycle. Because of this, your pets are at lower risk of developing a flea infestation in those states.
"
" 
"
"Even if you live in an area of the U.S. that may not be known for having large numbers of fleas and ticks, your pet may still benefit from preventive medications. Your veterinarian can give you the best advice as to your pet's risk for flea infestation or tick-borne diseases. Prevention is always easier, safer, and less expensive than treating a disease once it's become established in your pet.

"
"Few diagnoses in the veterinary world bring more pain to a dog owner than one simple word: cancer.
"
"The mind instantly goes to the perceived harshness of chemotherapy, surgery or radiation treatments; the likelihood of remission; and the possibility of losing the battle altogether.
"
"And while conditions such as kidney and heart disease can be more difficult to treat—and have a poorer chance of survival than some types of cancer—this doesn’t stop the specter of cancer from casting a dark shadow over your pet and family.
"
"Canine cancer is common enough that you are likely to hear those words from your veterinarian, but there are many options for treatment and care.
"
"In veterinary medicine, the goal of cancer treatment is entering remission, not curing it.
"
"Why? The reason is that aiming for curative treatment would make too many dogs sick. Veterinarians take into account the dosage of treatments and the symptoms they cause. Lower doses can be used to achieve remission, and in some cases, to cure it.
"
"As part of the protocol for treating canine cancer, veterinarians made the decision that dogs should not feel sick during treatment. You cannot explain to your dog that he has to go through bad days now in hopes of having good days later.
"
"The course of your dog’s cancer treatment will be determined by your veterinarian or veterinary oncologist, and will depend on the type of cancer as well as other factors specific to your dog.
"
"Your vet may recommend chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, or a combination of these dog cancer treatments.
"
"If symptoms relating to chemotherapy or radiation therapy cannot be treated with supplementary medicine, your veterinarian or veterinary oncologist may recommend discontinuing treatment.
"
"Veterinary medicine has also made some recent strides in other treatments, such as immunotherapy or antibody therapy.
"
"Here are the three most common forms of treatment for cancer in dogs.
"
"Performing surgery to physically remove as much of the cancer as possible is usually part of treatment whenever feasible.
"
"Surgery may be the only type of therapy that is recommended, or else it will be performed before or after chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
"
"While chemotherapy is a blanket term for using drugs to combat disease, it can be administered in several ways.
"
"According to Dr. Joanne Intile, DVM, MS, DACVIM, chemotherapy can be administered orally, intravenously (into a vein), topically, subcutaneously (under the skin), intramuscularly (into a muscle), intratumorally (directly into a tumor) or intracavitarily (into a body cavity).
"
"The majority of dogs treated with chemotherapy don’t suffer much in the way of serious side effects. This is because veterinarians do not use the same high doses of medicine as is used for people with cancer.
"
"Dogs may experience these side effects during chemotherapy:
"
"Most dogs will not lose their fur, but some breeds (those with continuously growing haircoats like Poodles) might experience some hair thinning.
"
"Your dog might also have a smaller appetite and experience temporary diarrhea or vomiting—typically mild and short-lived and will occur 24-72 hours after a chemotherapy session.
"
"Bone marrow suppression is another worry with chemotherapy treatments because it can lead to anemia and/or increased risk of infection. But these types of side effects are typically treatable.
"
"The Clinical Oncology Service at the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania estimates that the chance of “severe side effects … is estimated to be less than 5% of all pets receiving chemotherapy. With proper management, most animals recover uneventfully within a few days.”
"
"Your veterinarian will keep track of your dog’s progress through regular examinations, blood work and discussions with you regarding what you observe at home. They may make changes in the dosage or types of drugs that are used for treatment based on how your dog responds to them.
"
"Depending upon the type of cancer and how it is affecting your dog, your vet may recommend radiation therapy rather than chemotherapy.
"
"“Chemotherapy is a systemic treatment—once we inject it, it goes all throughout the body, battling microscopic disease when it starts spreading to other locations. Radiation therapy is a localized therapy, like surgery,” says Dr. Rick Chetney Jr., a veterinary oncologist who specializes in radiation treatments to fight cancer. “It’s often used for tumors that we can’t surgically remove because they’re up against necessary structures such as the heart or brain.”
"
"Whole- or half-body radiation can be used to treat cancers that are not contained in one location, such as lymphoma.
"
"Animals are given varying levels of sedation for radiation treatments, mainly to keep them still. There’s no direct pain from the radiation treatment itself, although some discomfort, skin problems or fatigue may be associated with its effects.
"
"“A definitive radiation therapy protocol is given once daily—usually with between 16-20 daily treatments—so it takes about three or four weeks,” says Dr. Chetney.
"
"Dr. Chetney explains, “An individual treatment takes about an hour and a half to two hours, and most of that time is spent waiting for the patient to become sleepy from the sedative, and then later to recover from the anesthesia. The treatment itself only takes about 5-10 minutes.”
"
"Depending on your dog’s specific cancer and situation, radiation may be administered less frequently, such as every other day or every third day.
"
"Talk to your veterinarian or veterinary oncologist about your options to make your dog’s therapy protocol practical for you to carry out.
"
"When your dog is diagnosed with cancer, one of the first concerns you may have is the cost. It’s hard to determine a general cost for treatment, because there are many different options and dosages depending on your dog and the type of cancer.
"
"Consulting with your vet or oncologist will certainly help get you a ballpark figure, but they may be hesitant to give you a specific figure since it’s impossible to predict just how your dog will respond to treatment. 
"
"They will lay out a treatment plan and proposed rate, but many factors that affect the eventual cost.
"
"“There are some cancers that are very affordable and inexpensive to treat, and others that really start to add up. Some cancers can be a couple hundred dollars a month, and others can start to add up into the thousands before you’re done. Everything is completely customized to that pet, what we know and what the wishes of the family are,” explains veterinary oncologist Dr. M.J. Hamilton, DVM, DACVIM (O).
"
"If you already have pet insurance, many types cover cancer treatment (most likely partially), but rules concerning preexisting conditions will generally prevent you from getting coverage once your dog has been diagnosed.
"
"According to the National Canine Cancer Foundation, an initial visit to confirm a cancer diagnosis can be upwards of $200.
"
"That doesn’t include any diagnostic tests that may be necessary for diagnosis, including X-rays, blood work and ultrasound examinations. Major surgery to remove a cancerous tumor that’s deep inside the body or that will require reconstruction, can start at $1,500.
"
"Chemotherapy treatments might range from $200-$5,000, depending upon the type and severity of the cancer. Radiation therapy can range from $2,000-$6,000 or higher.
"
"You will also need to factor in additional medications that might be needed—such as pain relievers or antibiotics—which could cost another $30-$50 per month for an indefinite period.

"
"According to Dr. Patrick Mahaney of Los Angeles, “It’s crucial that all veterinarians and pet owners be attuned to whole-body health, especially when a pet is diagnosed with cancer and is going through surgery, radiation or chemotherapy,” says Dr. Mahaney. “What’s not totally addressed in the veterinary oncology community is nutrition.”
"
"In terms of a cancer diet for dogs, keeping your dog on a diet that is easily digestible and contains the right balance of nutrients can help them feel better when undergoing radiation and chemotherapy. This is especially important as many of the milder side effects of treatment relate to the digestive system.
"
"While a diagnosis of cancer in your dog is by no means a certain death sentence, it’s sure to be a stressful time for you and your dog.
"
"Your veterinarian and veterinary oncologist will work with you to give you options for treatment and help walk you through any difficulties that come with it.
"
"Don’t just assume that you can’t afford certain treatments. There are palliative options that are inexpensive and can give you and your dog more good days together.
"
"Palliative care will help your dog feel like herself for as long as possible by minimizing pain and sometimes slowing the growth of the cancer.
"
"Maintain communication with your veterinarians, as they are your best resource for helping you maintain a good quality of life for your dog.

"Just the word “flea” can make us itchy—and it’s no wonder why. One flea can rapidly turn into an infestation of parasites that lay innumerable little flea eggs on dogs and cats.
"
"By Sarah Wooten, DVM
"
"Puppies that are not growing at a normal rate or who are too small for their age are stunted; that is, something has prevented them from growing naturally or at a normal rate.
"
"There are several things that can cause stunted growth in puppies, ranging from intestinal worm infections to genetics. In this article, we will address the most common concerns associated with stunting, and whether or not these concerns actually cause stunted growth in dogs.
"
"The most common reason why a puppy’s growth becomes stunted is because they are infected with hookworms or roundworms. Intestinal worms are extremely common in puppies in the United States — they either contract worms from their mother or from the environment around them. If a puppy has an extremely heavy worm infestation, the worms can steal enough calories from the puppy to slow down her growth. Puppies that have a heavy worm burden typically look unthrifty: they have a poor haircoat, diarrhea, a big pot belly, and are small and thin despite a voracious appetite.
"
"The good news is that once the puppy is free of worms, the body can heal itself and regain normal growth and development.
"
"To prevent worms in your puppy, follow the deworming schedule set forth by your breeder and/or veterinarian. If the schedules differ, follow the worming schedule set forth by your veterinarian.
"
"A common question puppy parents ask is whether a puppy’s growth can be stunted by taking him off puppy food too soon. The short answer is no, you will not stunt your puppy’s growth by switching to adult food too soon or by mildly under-feeding. Puppy food is formulated to support normal growth and development, and, while it is not ideal, there are millions of dogs out there that do just fine on a diet that is formulated for all life stages, and which are fine to feed to a puppy.
"
"On the contrary, you can do much more damage to your puppy’s long term joint health by over-feeding or giving supplements while the pup is still growing. According to the lifetime studies conducted by Purina on Labrador Retrievers, dogs will live on average two years longer and have much less chronic disease if you keep them slim their whole life. Ask your veterinarian about what the right body condition is for your puppy, and for tips on how much to feed to keep your puppy in his ideal condition.
"
"Just like a human child, your puppy will go through growth spurts during the first year. There will be days when she may need to eat more than the amount she will need as an adult. My 75-pound Goldendoodle, for example, eats two cups a day of dry dog food, but when she was growing (about eight months of age) she would eat up to four cups of food a day. You will need to be flexible about the amount you are feeding her sometimes in order to support her growth and development.
"
"Another common question is whether malnutrition itself will cause stunting. To be sure, puppies that suffer under extreme situations like starvation are at risk for stunted growth. But most puppies that are in caring, loving homes with pet parents who measure the appropriate amount they feed to their puppies — food that is adequate for supporting bones, muscles, and other tissues as they grow — will not have stunting from malnutrition, even if they keep the puppies slim.
"
"Having your dog spayed or neutered early will not stunt your puppy’s growth, but it might affect the joints of large breed dogs. Studies show that early spay/neuter does affect the growth plate, delaying its closure and causing dogs to grow taller than they should have. This can predispose the dog to later joint problems. 
"
"This is an excellent topic to discuss with your veterinarian. For small or medium sized dogs, the standard recommendation is still to spay/neuter the dogs between 6-8 months of age. For large breed dogs, however, the recommendation is to hold off until the dog is older to lower the risk of joint disease. For females, spaying should wait until after the first heat cycle, and for males, neutering can be scheduled when the dog is around two years old.
"
"Ask your dog’s doctor for her or his recommendations on when to spay or neuter your dog, and ask them for their reasons behind their recommendations.
"
"Catching fleas early is essential for controlling a flea outbreak. To get a flea infestation under control, it is important to fight fleas at every life stage, including targeting flea eggs.
"
"Here are some tips for identifying flea eggs on pets and how to get rid of them so you can keep your pet (and home!) pest-free.
"
"While adult fleas can be identified pretty easily, flea eggs on dogs and cats can be a little trickier to detect.
"
"Flea eggs are almost microscopic—typically about 0.5 millimeters in length and about half as wide. That’s about the size of a grain of salt. Flea eggs have a soft shell called a chorion that has an off-white color, similar to a grain of salt, though they are more oval in shape.
"
"Because flea eggs are easy to mistake for dry skin or sand, it’s usually not the first thing pet parents notice if their pet has a flea problem. If you have a flea infestation, finding flea dirt or actual fleas on your pet or in the home are more obvious signs.
"
"If you’d like to discern a flea egg from something else, place the speck on a dark piece of paper under a magnifying glass to identify the characteristically oval shape of a flea egg.
"
"People often mistake “flea dirt,” or flea feces, for flea eggs—though both are signs of a flea infestation.
"
"Unlike flea eggs, flea dirt is dark and crumbly. You can identify flea dirt by putting a few of the specks on a white piece of paper and adding a couple drops of water. If you see a red color—which signals the presence of digested blood—then you’re dealing with flea dirt.
"
"Flea dirt itself isn’t actually harmful and it’s easy to wash away with a gentle bath. The bad news is that it absolutely indicates a flea problem, which means your pet will require more than just a bath for treatment.
"
"Flea larvae hatch from flea eggs. They are an off-white color and look like tiny worms, ranging from 2–5 millimeters in length. But you may not see them during an infestation because they quickly burrow deep into carpets, cracks, and grass.
"
"At any given time, flea eggs make up more than half of a flea population, so you’ll want to address them quickly and effectively. However, getting rid of flea eggs should be a part of a multi-pronged approach to eliminating a flea infestation.
"
"Many modern flea treatments for pets contain ingredients that kill adult fleas and insect growth regulators (IGRs), which stop flea eggs from maturing into adults. Some IGRs also work to sterilize female fleas so they can’t lay viable eggs.
"
"Talk with your vet to decide which treatment they recommend for killing flea eggs on cats or dogs. They can help you choose the best product for your pet.
"
"Foggers provide a simple way to kill flea eggs (and many other pests). It’s recommended to use foggers in combination with sprays or other products that can be used under furniture, where foggers have trouble reaching.
"
"Many pet parents choose to use an environmental insect growth regulator to stop fleas from developing. Sprays with IGR, such as Sentry Home® household flea and tick spray for pets, are great for killing flea eggs in your home.
"
"Another effective way to get rid of flea eggs at home is to vacuum thoroughly. Flea eggs aren’t sticky, so while adult fleas typically lay their eggs on their host, those eggs soon fall off into the environment.
"
"Several years ago, people commonly believed that the fleas would continue to develop in the vacuum and make their way into the environment, but that’s simply not the case. Vacuuming kills adult and non-adult fleas (eggs, larvae, pupae), which means you don’t need to worry about what to do with the vacuum bag or canister.
"
"You can remove 32–90% of flea eggs (depending on the type of carpet you have) by simply vacuuming every other day while treating your flea infestation. Vacuuming will also lift up carpet fibers so that other environmental treatments work more effectively.
"
"Vacuuming is a great idea even if you don’t have carpet—on hard surfaces such as hardwoods or tile, vacuuming can lift flea eggs from hard-to-reach cracks. Mopping and steam cleaning can help to kill flea eggs, and washing linens, bedding, and pet beds in the washing machine on the hot cycle is also advisable.
"
"If possible, declutter your home so it’s easier to clean and there are fewer places for flea eggs to hide.
"
"It’s important that your flea-control program tackles fleas at all of their life stages, including flea eggs. Employing multiple types of flea protection will help to cover any gaps in your strategy.
"
"Be sure you speak with your veterinarian about the safety of any products you choose to use in your home and on your pet.
"
"Flea eggs are off-white in color.
"
"Flea eggs look like off-white and oval grains of salt on your pet. They can easily be mistaken for flakes of dry skin or sand.
"
"Engaging in strenuous exercise with your puppy will not stunt his growth, but the excessive impact associated with running may damage the growth plates of the long bones and cause them to develop abnormally, predisposing your puppy to joint issues later in life. Again, this is more a problem for large breed dogs because they simply weigh more.
"
"Playing fetch and allowing your puppy the space to run around until she is tired is fine, but don’t take her jogging or running until she is done growing. For clients who want their medium or large breed dog to be their jogging partner, my standard recommendation is to wait until after 15 months to allow for the bones to grow properly.
"
"Is there any one breed that is more predisposed to stunting than another? There is a rare disease called pituitary dwarfism in German Shepherds and in some Labrador Retrievers that has a genetic component, but these conditions are very rare and not generally seen in companion animals.

"West Nile is a virus that can cause encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. It’s spread by mosquitoes and is more common in warmer regions of the world that have high mosquito populations.
"
"While humans can contract West Nile virus, most don’t develop any symptoms. One person out of five will get a fever, and only one in 150 will develop a serious illness where they experience encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord).
"
"Dogs experience even fewer symptoms than people—most dogs never show any signs of the virus. This disease, however, is especially dangerous to horses, and vaccination against West Nile virus is recommended for all horses in North America.
"
"West Nile virus is very uncommon in dogs and is not considered a medical emergency. Pups who do get the virus are typically immunocompromised, senior, or very young. These symptoms mimic a mild virus and it is not considered to be a fatal virus in dogs.
"
"While most dogs infected with West Nile virus will have no symptoms, those who do may experience any of the following: 
"
"Fever
"
"Weakness
"
"Muscle spasms
"
"Poor appetite
"
"Lack of coordination
"
"Seizures or paralysis (very rare)
"
"The West Nile virus is carried by birds. Crows, raptors, and jays are particularly susceptible to getting the disease.
"
"When a mosquito feeds on an infected bird, it contracts the virus and can then spread it to other animals—including dogs. A dog is more likely to be exposed to West Nile virus if exposed to lots of mosquitoes.
"
"If your dog is experiencing symptoms, your veterinarian will start by getting a thorough medical history.
"
"Let your vet know if you have noticed unusual signs or behaviors in your dog at home and when you first noticed any changes. Be sure to share if your pet has had a high mosquito exposure.
"
"After getting a history, your vet will perform a physical exam. Based on the exam findings, they may elect to do bloodwork. Your vet may also do additional special blood tests if West Nile virus is suspected.
"
"One test looks for antibodies to the virus circulating in the bloodstream. Sometimes the virus is diagnosed by testing of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This fluid is obtained by a veterinarian who collects a sterile sample of spinal fluid while your pup is under anesthesia.
"
"There are no specific treatments for West Nile virus. Most treatment is geared toward supportive care, as with many other viruses.
"
"It’s important to keep your dog well hydrated and maintain adequate nutrition. Sometimes, anti-inflammatory medications such as carprofen or meloxicam are prescribed if your dog has a fever.
"
"Occasionally, hospitalization is recommended if more intense supportive care is needed. Hospitalization would usually entail IV fluids and possible supported feeding.
"
"Fortunately, it is uncommon for dogs to become severely ill from West Nile virus, and hospitalization is not common.
"
"Recovery from West Nile virus is usually smooth and uneventful, with most pet parents never knowing their dog was even infected. However, if your dog is diagnosed with West Nile virus and does become ill with a fever or other clinical signs, supportive care can often be done at home.
"
"If this is the case, make sure your dog has easy access to fresh food and water. Rarely, hand feeding may be necessary to encourage intake.
"
"If your dog is acting lethargic or not as excited about their food following a diagnosis of West Nile virus, it may be helpful to track their temperature.
"
"Consider purchasing a digital thermometer if you don’t already have one. If they are running a fever, your vet may prescribe dog-safe, anti-inflammatory pain medications for use during recovery. Remember—never give over-the-counter human medications to dogs without speaking with your veterinarian first.
"
"Most affected dogs recover within a couple of weeks. The rare, severely affected pup with neurological signs (such as lack of coordination or balance issues) may take months to recover. 
"
"The best way to prevent West Nile virus is to avoid exposing your dogs to mosquitoes as much as possible.
"
"Try to eliminate any mosquito habitat on your property. Mosquitoes like to lay their eggs in standing water, so regularly empty or turn over any items that hold water, such as planters, birdbaths, and trash containers.
"
"Tightly cover water storage containers like buckets and rain barrels so that mosquitoes are unable to get in and lay their eggs. Consider having a pest control company treat your home’s outdoor areas for mosquito adults and larvae.
"
"DEET-containing products are not safe for dogs and should never be used.
"
"Talk to your veterinarian about dog-safe mosquito repellents or consider a topical product labeled for dogs, such as Elanco™ K9 Advantix™ II.
"
"Because West Nile virus is extremely rare in dogs and is unlikely to cause any symptoms, there’s no vaccine for dogs.

"Roundworms are among the most common types of worms found in dogs—along with hookworms and whipworms.
"
"Roundworms can significantly impact a puppy’s health, and in rare cases, they can be fatal. But fortunately, roundworms in dogs can be easily diagnosed and effectively treated.
"
"This article will dive into and explain everything you need to know about roundworms in dogs—from what they are and the symptoms they cause to how to treat and prevent them.
"
"Ascaridoid nematodes, also known as roundworms, are large intestinal parasites commonly found in puppies. Although they are more commonly seen in puppies, adult dogs can also be infected by roundworms.
"
"There are two important species of roundworms:
"
"Toxocara canis (T. Canis)
"
"Toxascaris leonina
"
"T. Canis is the species that most commonly infects puppies and can be transmitted to people. 
"
"There are a few different ways that dogs can get roundworms.
"
"The most common mode of transmission of roundworms to puppies is through the placenta.
"
"In adults, when eggs are swallowed, the larvae hatch, migrate through the intestines and move into several different tissues of the body. Then the larvae stop developing, and they become dormant in cysts until a dog becomes pregnant.
"
"The larvae then start to develop during estrus and migrate across the placenta and into the puppy fetus. 
"
"Puppies can also be infected while nursing, as larvae can migrate into the mammary glands.
"
"If puppies less than 3 months of age ingest roundworm eggs, the larvae can penetrate the intestines and move into the lungs, where they are coughed up.
"
"The larvae are then swallowed and mature into adults in the intestinal tract. They produce eggs that can be identified under a microscope in a stool sample.
"
"Roundworm eggs can also be spread by different animals, including rodents, birds, and earthworms, to name a few. These animals are called paratenic hosts (or dead-end hosts), because their sole purpose is to transport the eggs.
"
"If a dog eats one of these animals, the roundworm eggs can then continue to develop in the dog.
"
"It is possible to easily see roundworms in the stool or vomit without a microscope; however, if you don’t see them, that doesn’t mean they are not there.
"
"A roundworm is white to pale brown in color and can be several inches long (up to 7 inches).
"
"However, it’s more common to diagnose roundworms by identifying the eggs in the feces under a microscope.
"
"After 6 months of age and in adult dogs, the roundworm larvae become encysted in the tissues of the body.
"
"The roundworms stop developing, and very few eggs can be found in the feces. This can make it difficult to diagnose and treat during this stage.
"
"T. canis larvae will then continue to develop during estrus (heat). If a dog is immunocompromised, the larvae can also complete their life cycle.
"
"The signs of roundworms in puppies can be very subtle in the early stages, and most symptoms are due to the roundworms feeding off of the same nutrients in the small intestines that the puppy requires.
"
"Symptoms can include:
"
"Lack of growth
"
"Poor body condition
"
"Dull hair coat
"
"Distended abdomen
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea with mucus
"
"Seeing a roundworm in dog vomit or feces
"
"Coughing
"
"Your vet might also see:
"
"Fluid in the abdomen
"
"Masses (granulomas) on the kidneys
"
"Fatty liver
"
"If larvae are swallowed by humans, they too can become infected. This is why thorough hygiene when handling puppies and the surrounding surfaces is very important.
"
"Most human infections do not cause symptoms; however, roundworm infection can lead to a condition known as Visceral Larva Migrans, which can cause a fever and enlarged liver.
"
"In rare cases, the larvae can migrate into the eyes and cause visual impairment.
"
"Roundworms require a veterinarian for treatment. There are no proven home remedies for roundworms for dogs.
"
"Several drugs are approved for the treatment of roundworms in dogs, including milbemycin, pyrantel, and fenbendazole. These medications are safe and effective. It typically only takes a few days after deworming for the adult roundworms to die.
"
"Heartworm preventatives also help to control future infections.
"
"Since most treatments are effective at killing adult worms and not larvae or eggs, multiple treatments two weeks apart will be recommended.
"
"The number of treatments recommended by your veterinarian will depend on the age and current health status of your dog (e.g., pregnancy). 
"
"Reinfection is also possible, so preventing future roundworm infections is an important part of the treatment.  
"
"Preventing roundworms in dogs is the key to successful treatment. Follow these tips to keep help prevent your dog from getting roundworms.
"
"Pick up your dog’s feces from the yard, dog parks, children’s play areas, etc., as soon as possible. Roundworm eggs live on many surfaces, including soil.
"
"Deworm pregnant dogs late in the pregnancy to help prevent newborn puppies from getting roundworms.
"
"Deworm your puppy regularly starting at 2 weeks of age.
"
"Keep your puppy or dog on heartworm medications to kill adult worms and prevent shedding of eggs in the environment.
"
"Practice strict hygiene, including handwashing after handling puppies or feces, and keeping the environment as clean as possible.

"The immune system is a collection of biological processes that protects against disease by identifying and killing the invading pathogens, as well as tumor cells. It works 24/7, guarding against invading organisms and infections, detecting a wide variety of invading agents including bacteria, viruses, and parasitic worms. One key feature of the immune system function is that it is able to distinguish the invading organisms from the body’s own cells and tissues.
"
"Primary immunodeficiency disorders involve weakened immune response when required. Primary immunodeficiency disorders are seen due to heritable defects in the immune system, whereas secondary immunodeficiency disorders are caused by some other primary disease.
"
"Breeds predisposed to primary immunodeficiency disorders include basset hounds, Cardigan Welsh corgis, Jack Russell terriers, Beagles, German shepherds, Chinese shar-pei, Doberman pinschers, dwarfed Weimaraners, gray collies, and Irish setters.
"
"Immunodeficiency disorders are a congenital disorder; i.e., dogs are born with them.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which may reveal various cell abnormalities or clues for infections. More specific tests are available for a more detailed evaluation of the immune system, and may be employed by the veterinarian with your consent. For example, he or she may take a bone marrow sample from your dog for evaluation.
"
"
"
"Unfortunately, no cure is available for congenital problems with the immune system. In cases of severe disease, hospitalization may be required to stabilize your dog. In the case of mild problems, your dog can be taken home after therapy.
"
"Prevention of infection is the key factor for keeping your dog healthy, and good management practices are required to prevent exposure to infections. In cases of infection, your veterinarian will give an antibiotic cover to treat infection; it may take a few days to a few weeks for a complete resolution of infections. Delay in recovery is due to poor immune system support in treating infections, and prolonged antibiotic cover is usually required.
"
"Prognosis largely depends upon the nature and extent of the problem. However, the animal cannot be complete “cured.” You should discuss the issue of hereditary diseases with your dog’s veterinarian and how these should be prevented in future litters.
"
"In some dogs, complete rest may be advised to prevent further complications. Diet is another important factor to meet for your dog’s daily nutritional requirements. Exposure to infection should be minimized in those animals prone to infections due to some hereditary problem.

"Epiphora is the medical term for the clear, watery substance that drains from a dog’s eyes that looks like excessive tears. You may notice that the moisture leads to a red-brown discoloration of the fur around their eyes. The discoloration is from a normal pigment in tears called porphyrin, and can lead to staining that is especially noticeable in dogs with white fur.
"
"Normal tear production is important to keep your dog’s eyes lubricated. Extra tears are stored in the tear ducts in the corner of dogs’ eyes near their nose. When the eyes are irritated by dust, hair, pollen, or other irritants, the stored tears can help to flush the particles from their eyes.
"
"Watery eyes are very common in dogs and are associated with things that irritate the eye and abnormal drainage of tears, or they may simply be normal for the dog’s breed.  A pet parent should seek veterinary care if the discharge is greenish-yellow and their dog is squinting. This may indicate an eye injury.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Epiphora can affect one or both eyes. It is more common for both eyes to be affected. Occasionally a dog will have an irritant (like an ingrown hair on the eyelid) that rubs only one eye. Sometimes a nasolacrimal duct, which runs from the eyes to the nose, will become plugged on only one side, leading to abnormal drainage of tears.
"
"Green-yellow drainage and squinting of one eye can also be signs of a corneal ulcer. If your dog has drainage from one eye that is not watery or obviously clear, and is accompanied by squinting or pain, they need to be seen by a veterinarian right away.
"
"Epiphora is usually caused by conditions that irritate the eye, the abnormal drainage of tears, or because that breed tends to have watery eyes.
"
"Several conditions can cause acute (sudden) or chronic (long-term) irritation to the eyes. The following are some of the more common conditions leading to irritation of the eyes and subsequent watery eyes:
"
"The following conditions can lead to abnormal drainage of tears and subsequent watery eyes:
"
"Watery eyes can be normal for a breed due to genetics. Some breeds of dog (such as Poodles, Shih Tzu, and Pekingese) can have epiphora with normal nasolacrimal systems and no obvious irritants.
"
"Veterinarians diagnose epiphora with a physical exam. Your vet may decide to measure the amount of tears produced using a method called the Schirmer tear test. A small absorbent strip is placed within the lower eyelid for one minute.
"
"If your vet suspects an eye injury, they may check for scratches (corneal ulcers) by staining the cornea with fluorescein. Your vet may also check the pressure in your dog’s eyes using tonometry, in which a hand-held probe gently touches the eye’s surface. This painless procedure checks for glaucoma.
"
"Treatment is varied, based on the underlying cause of your dog’s watery eyes. If irritation from allergies, like pollen, is the cause, your veterinarian may recommend an antihistamine along with artificial tear drops to flush the eyes. If there is an abnormality like an ingrown eyelash, rolled eyelid, or eyelid mass, surgery may be recommended to correct the problem.
"
"In some cases, no treatment is required if the excessive tearing is the result of shallow eye sockets or a normal condition for that breed. For these dogs, gently wiping the tear tracts regularly with gentle wipes, like Optixcare® Eye Cleaning Wipes, can be helpful to avoid accumulation of debris and secondary bacterial infections.
"
"Some conditions that cause watery eyes in dogs can be treated and carry a good prognosis for recovery. Chronic irritation from eyelid or eyelash abnormalities can be resolved with surgery.
"
"Allergies do not have a cure and are instead managed long term. Allergies may be seasonal or year-round and can be treated with various allergy medications, from over-the-counter antihistamines to prescription medications like Apoquel® or Cytopoint®.
"
"In breeds that are genetically prone to watery eyes with no abnormalities of the nasolacrimal system, the condition can only be managed. While the eyes will continue to produce excess tears, the goal is to prevent moisture on the skin from growing bacteria and the development of secondary skin infections.
"
"These dogs may require regular wiping of the tear tracts with gentle wipes that are labeled for dogs. Angels’ Eyes® Tear Stain Wipes are commonly used for routine cleansing and to minimize tear staining. Sometimes medicated products, like Douxo® Antiseptic Antifungal Wipes, are used to reduce overgrowth of yeast and bacteria.
"
"Remember, it is important to prevent any of these products from getting in your dog’s eyes and to only cleanse the skin beneath the eye where the tears fall.
"
"If your dog’s eyes are watering, but they appear comfortable and are not squinting, make sure to bring it up during your next wellness appointment. If your dog has watery eyes with squinting, decreased appetite, lethargy, or other signs of illness, seek veterinary care immediately.
"
"Most of the time, epiphora is not a painful condition. Occasionally, dogs may experience some mild discomfort or itchy eyes from chronic irritation.
"
"Allergies are a common cause of watery eyes in dogs.

"Belonging to the phylum Oomycota, Pythium insidiosum is a parasitic spore that is capable of spontaneous movement (or a motile zoospore) that enters the body through the nose/sinuses, esophagus, or through the skin. Infection then usually settles in the dog's lungs, brain, sinuses, gastrointestinal tract, or skin.
"
"Affected dogs will exhibit subcutaneous or cutaneous masses, which develop as lesions on the legs, tail, head, neck, perineum, and/or the inside of the thigh.
"
"Pythiosis is typically thought of as occurring in swampy areas in the southeastern U.S., and has thus been nicknamed “swamp cancer.” Signs of pythiosis usually appear in the fall or early winter months, and while this organism does typically thrive in tropical and subtropical waters, such as ponds, wetlands, and swamps, it has been found to occur as far west as the central valley of California.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn about how pythiosis affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Pythiosis of the lungs, brain, or sinus will manifest in the dog as stuffiness, head pain, fever, coughing, and swelling of the sinuses. Infection of the dog's digestive tract leads to a chronic disease, which causes the tissue of the stomach and/or intestines to become severely thick. Other symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) pythiosis include:
"
"Pythiosis of the skin (or cutaneous pythiosis) results in the development of swollen, non-healing wounds, and invasive masses of ulcerated pus-filled nodules and draining tracts. Tissue death (necrosis) follows, with the affected skin eventually turning black and wasting.
"
"Canine viral papillomatosis sounds serious, doesn’t it? But the term is just a technical description for warts (papillomas) in dogs. While a diagnosis of dog warts is rarely serious, the condition is worth your attention, primarily so you don’t confuse warts in dogs with other, nastier diseases. 
"
"Any dog can get warts, but they are more common in dogs who are immunosuppressed or spend a lot of time around other dogs. Young dogs frequently get warts in their mouths, while the skin of older dogs is more frequently affected. Certain breeds also seem to be at an increased risk of dog warts, including:  
"
"Shar-Pei
"
"Cocker Spaniels
"
"Miniature Schnauzers
"
"Kerry Blue Terriers
"
"Pugs 
"
" 
"
"Warts on dogs often look like a small head of cauliflower, but other, rarer types do exist, including an inverted papilloma (usually a firm lump with a dot in the middle) and dark, scaly plaques of skin that have an irregular surface.
"
"This infection is caused by direct contact with water that accommodates Pythium insidiosum, a water borne fungal parasite. It is usually swallowed or inhaled by the dog, and from there makes its way to the animal's intestinal tract.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, with a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. A blood sample will be sent for serological testing (via an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, called ELISA) to the Pythium Laboratory at Louisiana State University.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and recent activities, including any exposure your pet may have had to water in the last several months.
"
"Abdominal radiographs in dogs with GI pythiosis may show an intestinal blockage, intestinal wall thickening, or an abdominal mass. An ultrasound image of the dog's abdomen will tend to show thickening of the wall of the stomach or intestine. Enlarged lymph nodes may also be evident, as it is an indication of an infection.
"
"While biopsy can suggest a diagnosis of pythiosis, a positive culture will be needed for a definitive diagnosis. There is also an immunohisto-chemical stain, which specifically attaches to P. insidiosum hyphae in thin sections of tissue.
"
"Another method for definitively diagnosing pythiosis is to test tissue samples and cultured isolates with nested Polymerase Chain Reaction, a test of dog's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
"
"
"
"The sooner you take your dog for treatment after the first signs appear, the better the prognosis.
"
"All dogs will need to undergo surgical removal of as much affected tissue as possible. The tissue remaining after surgery will then be treated with a laser (photoablation) to kill any fungal filaments in the surrounding tissue. Enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal cavity should be biopsied (tissue will be surgically removed for examination). Medical therapy should be continued for a minimum of six months.

"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments every two to three months after the initial surgery so that ELISA serological tests can be performed. Abdominal X-rays should be retaken at each visit to re-evaluate intestinal signs of disease. A chemical blood profile should be repeated at each check-up, as well, to monitor your pet for liver toxicity while it is being treated with Itraconazole, the drug of choice for treating pythiosis.
"
"In 2004, a new immunotherapeutic vaccine for dogs was made available for pythiosis. As soon as your dog is diagnosed, it should be vaccinated with the pythiosis vaccine to reduce the size of the lesion. Surgery will then be easier and more successful.

"Warts can develop in and around a dog’s mouth, around the eyes, between the toes, and almost anywhere on the skin.
"
"Some dogs develop one or just a few warts that are so small they are easy to overlook. In other cases, entire regions of a dog’s body may be covered with warts of varying sizes. Warts in and around a dog’s mouth may make it difficult for a dog to eat and drink normally. Warts on a dog’s feet can cause lameness, particularly if the area is injured or becomes infected.
"
"Warts in dogs are caused by infection with papillomaviruses. Many different types of canine papillomaviruses have been identified, and each type tends to cause a particular form of the disease (for example, warts in and around the mouth versus warts affecting the feet).
"
"Dogs with warts are contagious to other dogs, but not to other animals or people. Once a dog has been infected with one type of papillomavirus, they are immune to that type—but not to others. 
"
"Papillomavirus can live in the environment for weeks, so it’s possible for a dog with warts to leave the virus behind in a particular area, leading to another dog contracting the virus from that location later. Papillomaviruses enter the body through a break in the skin, and infection develops when a dog’s immune system can’t fight off the virus before it takes hold. It generally takes four to six weeks for warts to develop after a dog is infected with papillomavirus. 
"
"ADVERTISEMENT
"
"In most cases, a veterinarian can diagnose a dog wart with just a physical examination. If there are any questions about the diagnosis, the veterinarian can remove a sample of tissue and send it to a pathologist for identification. 
"
"Warts generally disappear on their own over six to eight weeks or so as the dog develops immunity against the virus. However, there are times when veterinary treatment is necessary: 
"
"Sometimes dog warts are so numerous, large, or located in places that result in secondary symptoms like lameness, difficulty eating or drinking, or eye irritation. 
"
"Warts may bleed or become infected with bacteria. 
"
"In rare cases, warts that fail to resolve on their own can turn into cancerous tumors. In general, warts that are present for more than three to five months should be treated. 
"
"Dogs who are taking immunosuppressive medications or have other, serious health conditions may be unable to get rid of warts without help. 
"
"If just a single or small number of warts is of concern, surgical removal is the treatment of choice. This can be done with a scalpel, laser, or through cryosurgery (using intense cold to destroy the wart).  
"
"Medications are often necessary when a large number of warts are causing problems for the dog. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to assess how effective these treatments are since most dog warts disappear on their own. However, the following treatments have been tried by veterinarians: 
"
"Interferon: an oral or injectable medication that stimulates the immune system 
"
"Imiquimod: a topical antiviral and antitumor medication 
"
"Cimetidine: an oral medication that may have a positive effect on the immune system 
"
"Azithromycin: treatment with this oral antibiotic appeared effective in one study 
"
"Immunostimulation: giving a vaccine made from a dog’s own warts or Immunoregulin (a suspension of killed Propionibacterium acnes bacteria) can stimulate the immune system to respond against the virus 
"
"Reduce immunosuppression: if possible, discontinue or reduce the dose of immunosuppressive drugs and more aggressively treat any diseases that are having an adverse effect on the dog’s immune system 
"
"There are a few things you can do to help protect your dog from developing warts. Obviously, do not let your dog play with or have any contact with dogs who have visible warts. If the protective nature of your dog’s skin is compromised (from wounds, rashes, etc.) or their immune system is not functioning normally, do not take them to areas where other dogs congregate like parks, doggy day cares, and kennels. 
"
"And if, despite your best efforts, your dog does develop warts, keep them isolated from other pups until all the warts have disappeared.

"“Walking dandruff” is the common name for cheyletiellosis, a skin disease in dogs caused by the Cheyletiella mite.
"
"Cheyletiella is a contagious skin parasite that results in scaling of the skin. Sometimes, in a severe infestation, the white mites can be seen walking across the skin, hence the nickname “walking dandruff.”
"
"Cheyletiellosis affects dogs, cats, rabbits, and humans. Due to regular flea-and-tick-prevention product use, Cheyletiella is not a common parasite. These products are not labeled specifically for Cheyletiella mites, but they may reduce a pet’s risk of contracting walking dandruff. Cheyletiellosis is more commonly found in puppies and kittens in unclean or less sanitary conditions or in kennels.
"
"If left untreated, cheyletiellosis may lead to more severe skin infections and chronic skin disease. When the immune system is busy fighting chronic inflammation, it allows secondary bacteria and yeast to grow. This may result in excessive scaling, hair loss, itching, and discomfort.
"
"The most common sign of walking dandruff in dogs is white flakes on the skin and coat. The presence of white mites contributes to the appearance of excessive dandruff.
"
"Keep in mind that most pets with walking dandruff do not scratch a lot. However, they may have an allergic reaction to the Cheyletiella mite and become very itchy. They may also develop scaly, crusty skin, especially on their back. Sneezing may also accompany a Cheyletiella infestation in some dogs.
"
"As noted, walking dandruff is caused by Cheyletiella mites. These mites are very contagious and are most often found in large kennels, boarding facilities, groomers, or where dogs have close contact with other dogs.
"
"The mite lives on the hair, only visiting the skin to feed. The mite spends most of its life on the pet but can survive in the surrounding environment for up to 10 days. An infected pet’s bedding or a kennel they have been in can be a source of infection to other pets.
"
"Walking dandruff is a zoonotic disease, an infection that can be spread between animals and humans. So, other pets and humans in your household are at risk of contracting the Cheyletiella mite from an infected pet. Fortunately, humans are not the preferred host for this parasite. Symptoms of human infection are itchy, red bumps that usually resolve after the pet is properly treated.
"
"If your pet is diagnosed with walking dandruff, talk to your healthcare provider about any recommended testing and treatment for you and your family.
"
"The most common tests veterinarians use to diagnose walking dandruff are skin scrapes and acetate tape preparations. A skin scrape is a procedure that uses a small blade to scrape cells off the surface of your dog’s skin to determine the type of mite. During an acetate tape preparation, your vet uses a piece of tape to collect flakes of dandruff from your pet’s coat, places them on a microscope slide, and looks for Cheyletiella mites.
"
"Other skin tests that are commonly used include:
"
"A Wood’s lamp examination using ultraviolet (UV) light, or blacklight
"
"Fungal cultures where hairs are plucked and placed in a growth medium
"
"Skin cytology from impression smears, scrapes, or plucks
"
"Bloodwork to rule out underlying thyroid disease or other endocrine conditions
"
"Skin biopsies
"
"There are several treatments for cheyletiellosis in dogs, including topical treatments:
"
"Lime sulfur baths
"
"Topical flea and tick spot-on (Revolution, Frontline)
"
"Spray (Frontline spray) products
"
"Oral medications, including Trifexis, Sentinel, and Heartgard
"
"Your veterinarian can help guide treatment of your pet. Remember that all animals in the home (dogs, cats, and rabbits) exposed to Cheyletiella should be treated.
"
"Some treatments are safe for some dogs but not for cats, rabbits, and certain dog breeds or ages. Ask your veterinarian which treatment is best for your pet and follow the instructions. Do not discontinue a treatment before it is completed.
"
"In addition to treating all pets in your household, it is important to treat the environment as well. Remember that Cheyletiella can survive off the animal and in the environment for up to 10 days. Wash all bedding your pet sleeps on with hot water and detergent. Thoroughly clean the house using cleaners that are designed to treat fleas and remove adult mites, and follow the directions on the product label.
"
"If a pet’s bedding is not washed or all pets in the household are not treated, repeat infections can occur. Also, some animals can be silent carriers and have mites on their coat, but they may not show obvious clinical signs of cheyletiellosis.
"
"Pets are no longer contagious 3 weeks after treatment. Most treatment programs last at least 3 weeks.
"
"The prognosis for recovery from cheyletiellosis, or walking dandruff, is excellent when it is treated appropriately. Walking dandruff in humans heals with time, even without treatment, because humans are accidental hosts, and the infection resolves itself.
"
"Untreated pets will continue to be infected with Cheyletiella mites for the long term and may develop chronic skin disease and secondary skin infections.
"
"Dogs that have been infected and treated can become infected again if they are re-exposed. Having cheyletiellosis does not make them more likely to get it in the future unless they are re-exposed to an untreated source.
"
"Many flea and tick products that are on the market today, such as fipronil (Frontline) and selamectin (Revolution), are very effective against walking dandruff in dogs.
"
"To reduce your pet’s risk of contracting walking dandruff, keep them up to date on their topical or oral flea and tick preventative medication.

"Von Willebrand’s disease or vWD is a common bleeding disorder that dogs can inherit from one or both parents. When there is a deficiency in von Willebrand Factor (vWF) proteins, a dog’s ability to form a blood clot is missing. That means that if your dog is injured and bleeding, and there is a lack of, or abnormal vWF proteins, a blood clot to stop the bleeding will not be able to form.
"
"There are three types of von Willebrand disease:
"
"Type 1: There are fewer amounts of vWF proteins.
"
"Type 2: Some proteins are present, or there is an abnormal structure of the proteins.
"
"Type 3: There are little to no proteins available; this is the most severe form.
"
"Proper testing and treatment should be considered equally, regardless of type. Both males and females are at risk—and because it can be passed to puppies, it is recommended not to breed any dogs either affected or found to be carriers of the condition. 
"
"Doberman Pinschers are the breed most commonly associated with vWD, but it’s estimated that vWD has occurred in over 40 dog breeds, such as:
"
"Golden Retriever
"
"Schnauzer
"
"German Shorthaired Pointer
"
"There are four chambers in the heart. The two top chambers are the atria (single: atrium), and two bottom chambers are the ventricles. Valves are provided between each atrial and ventricular pair, each on the left and right side, allowing blood to pass from the atria to the ventricles, where it is then pumped out of the heart into the body – the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps blood  to the body. The heart works with exceptional synchronization between the various atrial and ventricular structures, resulting in a consistent rhythmic pattern.
"
"Ventricular standstill, also termed asystole, is an absence of ventricular complexes (called QRS) measured on an electrocardiogram (ECG), or absence of ventricular activity (electrical-mechanical dissociation). Electrical-mechanical dissociation is when there is a recorded ECG cardiac rhythm (P–QRS–T), but no effective cardiac output or palpable femoral pulse (the pulse of the artery in the inner thigh).
"
"Ventricular standstill will lead to cardiac arrest and irreversible brain injury if the ventricular rhythm is not restored within 3-4 minutes. This condition can result from severe sinoatrial block or arrest (stoppage of the SA node, or pacemaker), or by third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (which also causes blockage of the heart’s beat) without a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm (a junctional or escape rhythm would carry on the beat of the heart, saving the animal from cardiac arrest.)
"
"Once the initial emergency has been managed, your veterinarian will need a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your doctor can then perform a complete physical exam on your dog. Initially, just an electrolyte panel may be taken to determine if your dog has high serum potassium, a condition that is known to lead to ventricular standstill. This will be followed by standard laboratory tests, including a biochemical profile, a complete blood count and a urinalysis. Systemic disease as an underlying cause of heart disease must be ruled out. Additional diagnostics will include an electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording, which can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat).
"
"
"
"This is an emergency situation requiring aggressive treatment. Your veterinarian will perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation to begin your dog's heart beat and will want to make sure that your dog's heart rate is strong and consistent before going forward. Any treatable problems, such as hypothermia, hyperkalemia, or acid-base disorders will be treated.
"
"If primary heart disease is suspected, an echocardiogram (ECHO), a sonographic tool, can be used to visually monitor the heart's ability to pump blood, the pattern of blood flow, and to look for tissue damage. Chest X-rays will also be taken to look for any abnormalities in the thoracic (chest) structure. The patient should be closely and frequently monitored with an ECG.
"
"Unfortunately, patients with this condition have a poor prognosis. Even when sinus rhythm is re-established, the prognosis is still usually guarded to poor, as it is not uncommon for the patients to undergo cardiac arrest again.

"Like humans, the vestibular system in dogs is responsible for maintaining balance, posture, and head position, and influences eye movement.
"
"Vestibular System: The entire vestibular system is located within a portion of the ear, just past the eardrum, called the middle ear. Within the middle ear is a smaller area composed of many inter-related structures, collectively known as the inner ear.
"
"Vestibular Disease: Vestibular disease is any abnormal function of the middle or inner ear (vestibular system) that causes sudden loss of balance and coordination, among other symptoms. Since the inner ear is part of the middle ear, any disease that affects the middle ear—or specifically targets the inner ear—may cause vestibular disease.
"
"Vestibular disease in dogs is also known as geriatric or “old dog” vestibular disease or canine idiopathic vestibular disease.
"
"Like vertigo (dizziness) in humans, vestibular disease in dogs is caused by a dysfunction of the inner ear. The symptoms of vestibular disease in dogs are similar to the symptoms of vertigo in humans.
"
"When a cause of vestibular disease is unknown, it is called idiopathic vestibular disease or syndrome. This type of vestibular disease happens most commonly in older dogs, which is the reason it is known as geriatric or “old dog” vestibular disease.
"
"Old dog vestibular disease happens suddenly, and symptoms traditionally do not progress or worsen over time. Your dog will show the worst symptoms of the disease within the first 48 hours and will typically improve over two to three weeks.
"
"The most common symptoms of vestibular disease in dogs include:
"
"Head tilting
"
"Walking in circles
"
"Lack of coordination
"
"Stumbling or staggering (ataxia)
"
"German Shepherd
"
"Scottish Terrier
"
"Standard Poodle
"
"Shetland Sheepdog
"
"Bernese Mountain Dog
"
"The main symptom of vWD in dogs is any type of excessive, prolonged, or spontaneous bleeding, but other symptoms can include:
"
"Blood in the urine
"
"Blood in the feces (bright red or black tarry coloration)
"
"Nose bleeds
"
"Bleeding from the mouth or gums
"
"Excessive bleeding during loss of baby teeth
"
"Prolonged bleeding after giving birth
"
"Prolonged bleeding during heat cycle
"
"Bruising, which can vary from small, pinpoint hemorrhages (petechiae) to large, coalescing bruises (ecchymoses)
"
"Prolonged bleeding after any signs of trauma or surgery
"
"Anemia (decrease in red blood cell count) and death, if severe
"
"It is important to note that the symptoms do not always occur at a young age. Some dogs aren’t diagnosed until much later in life, often brought on by trauma.
"
"Diagnosis of vWD is often through a blood test. Additionally, your veterinarian may recommend a basic blood cell count, chemistry, and coagulation profile. Most often, these tests are normal and helpful at determining your dog’s overall health status, although some dogs can have prolonged clotting times. 
"
"All dogs used for breeding and breeds predisposed to the condition should be screened for the condition, which can be done through commercially available DNA tests like Wisdom Panel™.  Simply swab your dog’s cheek for at least 15 seconds and then mail the swab back to the lab. Results are returned in a few weeks. vWD Types 1, 2, and 3 are all included in the test. Many veterinary practices now offer this test as a standard part of their puppy wellness visits. 
"
"Treatment often requires a blood transfusion. Your veterinarian will be the best source for all treatment options and recommendations on how to best care for your dog.
"
"Unfortunately, vWD cannot be cured, but it can be managed, and certain precautions can be taken to help improve the outcome and prognosis of any dog affected by the condition. 
"
"The condition can be prevented if ethical breeding standards are upheld. Dogs suffering from the condition or that are carriers should not be used for breeding due to the potential for passing it on to their puppies. 
"
"Notifying the veterinary staff of your dog’s condition is vital so that any medications or future treatments can be performed as safely as possible, or avoided altogether. Limiting rough play, monitoring him for signs of bleeding and/or bruising, and taking steps to decrease stress and anxiety in your dog’s life is key.
"
"Yes! Dogs can certainly live with the condition, and you as the pet parent can help by taking certain precautions such as preventing rough play and minimizing undue stress. 
"
"It is always challenging to predict the life expectancy of a dog living with von Willebrand disease. Though some dogs can maintain a relatively normal life without any significant complications, others can suffer prematurely from complications or from the disease itself.
"
"Rapid eye movement (nystagmus)
"
"Drooling
"
"Vomiting
"
"Horner’s syndrome (drooping of the upper eyelid and face muscles on one side of face)
"
"Various causes of vestibular disease in dogs include:
"
"Ear infection that extends past the eardrum into the middle and inner ear. Middle or inner ear infections are the result of a chronic traditional ear infection, or when an ear infection is left untreated.
"
"Ruptured eardrum or trauma caused, for example, by using a cotton-tipped applicator during your dog’s ear cleaning.
"
"Tumors or polyps growing around the middle ear.
"
"Hypothyroidism
"
"In extremely rare cases, some medications may cause vestibular disease in dogs like aminoglycoside antibiotics, metronidazole, or topical chlorhexidine.
"
"To diagnose vestibular disease, your vet will want to know your dog’s medical history including current medications, the start and progression of symptoms, and any current illnesses or conditions.
"
"At the hospital, a physical exam will determine if your dog is showing signs of vestibular disease. If vestibular disease is confirmed, a neurological exam determines if it is a central dysfunction (tumor or polyp) or a peripheral dysfunction (ear infection).
"
"Based on the findings of the neurological exam, your vet will determine the most appropriate test. Tests may include:
"
"Ear cytology: A sample of debris from the ear canal is collected which identifies if yeast, bacteria, mites (or a combination) is causing an ear infection. Not all ear infections extend past the ear drum into the inner ear. Based on symptoms, the physical exam, and test results, your veterinarian can determine if an ear infection is the likely cause of the vestibular disease.
"
"Complete blood count: Confirms or denies other systemic infections or blood-related abnormalities like anemia that may also cause stumbling similar to vestibular disease.
"
"Internal organ function or biochemistry test: Although it cannot determine cancer or tumor location, this test can suggest if further cancer or other organ dysfunction testing is needed.
"
"Urinalysis: Results, in conjunction with other tests, identify if an underlying condition may be the cause of the vestibular disease.
"
"Advanced imaging: X-rays (radiographs) or CT (computed tomography) scans confirm the suspicion of polyps or tumors.
"
"Since vestibular disease in dogs is caused by an underlying condition, your vet will treat the dog’s underlying condition first, and then control the effects of vestibular disease with supportive care.
"
"Supportive care for vestibular disease is based on each dog’s symptoms and may include:
"
"Anti-nausea medication to decrease vomiting and help with motion sickness.
"
"Topical skin care for pets that cannot walk or hold themselves in position for normal urination and defecation, to prevent urine scald, bed sores, and skin infections.
"
"Oral antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections.
"
"IV (intravenous) fluids, as needed.

"Sedatives to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety.
"
"Overall, the prognosis of vestibular disease in dogs is good if the underlying cause can be resolved.
"
"Most dogs that are diagnosed with vestibular disease start to improve within one week, and often return to normalcy within three weeks. Some, however, may develop a permanent head tilt or may have continued episodes of ataxia. During recovery at home, it is important to provide a calm and quiet environment free of potential dangers such as pools, stairs, or items that may cause injury.
"
"A recurrence of vestibular disease is possible, but uncommon. A head tilt or mild ataxia may linger, even when other symptoms are resolved. However, neither symptom is life-threatening, and dogs can go on to live a normal life.
"
"When your dog’s vestibular disease is caused by an ear infection, resolution of the ear infection usually results in resolution of the vestibular disease.  When the cause of vestibular disease is unknown, symptoms usually resolve completely within three weeks. 
"
"In severe cases—or cases where the underlying cause cannot be resolved—like tumors or polyps that cannot be removed, supportive care at the hospital is needed until your dog can eat, walk, and eliminate on its own. 
"
"Dogs can live a long and normal life with vestibular disease, although side effects like nausea, motion sickness, episodes of ataxia, or a head tilt may still be present.
"
"Yes, for most causes of vestibular disease in dogs, treatment will result in the complete resolution of symptoms. In cases where the cause is a growth, like a tumor or polyp, complete resolution may depend on growth removal.

"If you live in the southwestern United States, you’ve probably heard of Valley Fever. But are you familiar with how common and severe the disease can be in dogs?
"
"If you live in a place where Valley Fever is a risk, or if you’re considering a trip to this part of the country, you need to learn about this disease to protect your canine family members. Here is your guide to Valley Fever in dogs.
"
"Valley Fever is a disease caused by infection with a type of fungus called Coccidiodes immitis. The condition may also be called coccidioidomycosis, California disease, desert rheumatism, or San Joaquin Valley Fever.
"
"The disease is extremely common in south-central Arizona, but it’s also frequently diagnosed in other parts of Arizona and in the desert regions of New Mexico, southwestern Texas, California, Nevada, and Utah. Parts of Mexico and Central and South America are affected, too. 
"
"People and dogs are most commonly diagnosed with Valley Fever, but it can also infect most mammals, including cats.
"
"Coccidiodes organisms live in desert soils and produce long filaments of mold that contain infectious spores. When the soil is disturbed, such as by a digging dog, by construction, or during a windstorm, the spores become airborne and can be inhaled. Once inhaled, the spores transform into a yeast-like organism that infects the lungs. 
"
"Between 6–10% of dogs living in Pima, Pinal, and Maricopa counties in Arizona are diagnosed with Valley Fever every year. It’s thought that dogs are so frequently diagnosed with Valley Fever because they commonly disturb and sniff dirt in their normal, daily activities.
"
"Should your dog develop Valley Fever, you do not have to worry about them passing the disease on to you or to other pets. Valley Fever is not contagious. Rather, it’s transmitted by inhaling spores contained in dirt and dust—not through contact with a sick animal or person. 
"
"Many dogs who are exposed to Coccidiodes immitis do not develop symptoms of illness. In these cases, the dog’s immune system is able to contain and destroy the organisms before they can reproduce and cause Valley Fever. But when a dog is exposed to a large number of spores or has a weakened immune system, Valley Fever can take hold.
"
"Typical symptoms of an infection that is limited to the lungs include:
"
"Coughing
"
"Lethargy
"
"Fever
"
"Poor appetite
"
"Weight loss
"
"Additional symptoms are seen when the infection spreads outside of the lungs. Other possible symptoms include:
"
"Back or neck pain
"
"Lameness
"
"Seizures
"
"Abscesses
"
"Skin wounds that don’t heal as expected
"
"Swollen lymph nodes
"
"Eye abnormalities
"
"Heart failure
"
"Blindness
"
"In Arizona, it appears the highest risk of exposure to Coccidiodes immitis occurs during the drier months of June, July, October, and November, but this may not be the case in other parts of the country. Symptoms of infection may occur weeks, months, or even years after exposure.
"
"Veterinarians who practice in areas where Valley Fever is widespread are very familiar with the disease and will commonly test for it in dogs with typical symptoms. If you have recently traveled to or moved from a region where Valley Fever is commonly diagnosed and your dog is unwell, you MUST tell your veterinarian about your dog’s travel history and/or specifically ask whether a Valley Fever test should be administered.
"
"The most common way to test for Valley Fever is with a titer—a test that measures the level of antibodies against Coccidiodes within a blood sample. In other words, a titer test determines whether or not a dog has been exposed to Coccidiodes.
"
"Veterinarians combine the results of a dog’s titer with other diagnostic tests (complete blood cell counts, blood chemistry panels, X-rays, etc.) and a dog’s symptoms and history to make the final determination as to whether or not a dog has Valley Fever. Additional types of tests are available and can be used to help diagnose complicated cases.
"
"Dogs diagnosed with Valley Fever will be given anti-fungal medications that inhibit the growth of Coccidiodes organisms and allow the dog’s immune system to control—and hopefully eliminate—the infection. Commonly used medications include: 
"
"Fluconazole 
"
"Itraconazole
"
"Ketoconazole
"
"Other options are available for dogs with severe infections or those that don’t respond to traditional treatments. Veterinarians may also prescribe anti-inflammatory medications, pain relievers, nutritional support, fluid therapy, and other treatments based on the specifics of a dog’s case.
"
"Valley Fever requires long-term treatment. Dogs are typically given anti-fungal medications for at least six months to a year, but some may need extended or even life-long treatment to prevent relapses. Veterinarians determine the best time to discontinue anti-fungal medications based on a dog’s response to treatment and follow-up testing, and then they will closely monitor for relapses.
"
"More than 90% of dogs treated for Valley Fever will survive, according to the University of Arizona. Dogs with symptoms involving several parts of the body (particularly the brain) or that do not respond well to anti-fungal medication have a worse prognosis.
"
"Unfortunately, relapses are common even with appropriate treatment, so it’s very important to monitor dogs closely. In general, dogs that relapse respond well again to treatment but may need to stay on an antifungal medication for the rest of their lives.
"
"If you live in or visit a Valley Fever endemic area, take steps to protect your dog’s health. Do what you can to reduce his exposure to soils and airborne dust. For example, keep your dog indoors as much as is practical. When outside with your dog, keep them on a leash and walk them on paved sidewalks.

"Vaginal discharge in female dogs can be clear, bloody and viscous, or a thick yellow or white fluid. For your veterinarian to treat your dog’s vaginal discharge effectively, they need to make an accurate diagnosis.
"
"Heat-related discharge is a common and messy issue for pet parents of unspayed female dogs. Aside from this situation, vaginal discharge is not very common in pups. Pet parents may use doggy diapers if needed.
"
"Several serious health issues can cause your dog to develop vaginal discharge. For this reason, it’s important for your vet to evaluate your pup’s condition to ensure your dog gets the treatment she needs.
"
"A female dog can have vaginal discharge whether she is spayed or unspayed. In addition to discharge, a dog with a vaginal or vulvar condition may exhibit the following signs:
"
"Spotting blood
"
"Licking the perineal region
"
"Vulvar swelling or redness
"
"Hind end scooting
"
"Frequent urination
"
"Vaginitis is inflammation of the vagina that may cause redness, swelling, and discharge. In puppies, it is usually a harmless condition that resolves on its own after its estrus (heat cycle), but older dogs usually need treatment.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Many dogs will not show any signs or the symptoms may be intermittent. If your dog does exhibit symptoms, they may include:
"
"Discharge from the vulva (typically cloudy and white to yellow in color)
"
"Licking the vulva
"
"Attraction of males 
"
"Frequent urination/attempted urination 
"
"Irritation of the skin around the vulva (from excessive licking) 
"
"Dogs with vaginitis typically do not appear sick and will appear playful and happy, despite exhibiting one of the above symptoms.  

If you notice additional symptoms, like lethargy (tiredness), weakness, inappetence, or vomiting, please contact your local animal hospital immediately as these could be signs that a more serious issue is occurring.
"
"Anything that causes inflammation, irritation, or a moist environment can cause vaginitis. Most of the time, vaginitis is caused by a bacterial infection and bacteria tend to thrive in regions where there is warmth and moisture (such as the urogenital tract). Other possible causes include:
 
"
"A structural abnormality of the vulva (such as a hooded vulva that is hidden or recessed by surrounding skin) or urinary tract that makes it easier for bacterial infections to thrive 
"
"Viral infection, such as Canine Herpesvirus
"
"Foreign material in the vagina, like dust or dirt
"
"Medications, such as hormone altering/producing steroids, creams, etc. 
"
"Cancer 
"
"Vaginal discharge in dogs can be caused by numerous factors, including:
"
"The heat cycle—Unspayed female dogs go into heat approximately every six months and often have a bloody discharge from their vulva during this time.
"
"Pyometra—Pyometra is a uterine infection that commonly affects older unspayed female dogs. Although the condition is rare, a spayed female dog can also develop pyometra if uterine remnants are left behind during her spay procedure. The vaginal discharge associated with pyometra typically emits a foul-smelling odor that may be fish-like. Pyometra can be fatal and is considered a veterinary emergency.
"
"Vaginitis—Vaginal inflammation can occur in female puppies and adult dogs. Vaginitis can affect spayed or unspayed females, but the condition is more common in those that are spayed.
"
"Urinary tract infection (UTI)—Some dogs who have a UTI will have a vulvar discharge.
"
"Vaginal trauma—Trauma to the vaginal area, which can occur during mating, can lead to a discharge.
"
"Brucellosis—Brucellosis is a bacterial infection that often causes a persistent vaginal discharge. The infection is zoonotic, which means it can be transmitted to people.
"
"Foreign body—A foreign body lodged inside the vagina, such as a wild grass bristle, can lead to a vaginal discharge.
"
"Pregnancy loss—Dogs who experience pregnancy loss typically exhibit vaginal discharge that may be brown, green, black, or yellow and have a foul odor.
"
"Retained placenta—If a dog does not pass the placenta when birthing puppies, the retained tissue can lead to a vaginal discharge.
"
"Tumor—Uterine or vaginal tumors can cause a discharge.
"
"To effectively treat your pup, your veterinarian will need to determine the cause of your dog's vaginal discharge.
"
"In addition to getting a detailed health history from you about your pup and performing a thorough physical exam, your vet may recommend the following diagnostic tests:
"
"Some causes of vaginal discharge in dogs are life-threatening, but many others are less dire. Depending on the cause of your dog’s vaginal discharge, her treatment may include:
"
"Surgery—Your veterinarian may surgically remove your dog’s ovaries and infected uterus if your pup has pyometra. Surgery may also be necessary to remove a retained placenta or fetus. In addition, dogs who have vulvar fold dermatitis can benefit from surgery to remove the extra skinfolds in the area.
"
"Antibiotics—For a dog with a UTI or vaginal infection, oral antibiotics may be necessary. Your veterinarian will also prescribe antibiotics if your pup has brucellosis, though no treatment completely eliminates the bacteria.
"
"Vaginal douches—If your dog has vaginitis, your vet may prescribe a dilute chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine solution for vaginal douching.
"
"Your dog’s recovery depends on the cause of her vaginal discharge. Recovery for specific issues can include:
"
"Pyometra—If treated before the condition becomes severe, most dogs recover well after an ovariohysterectomy (removal of uterus and ovaries). However, if your dog is left unspayed, the condition will likely recur.
"
"Juvenile vaginitis—Most cases affecting puppies will resolve on their own without treatment.
"
"Adult-onset vaginitis—With appropriate treatment, most cases resolve in two to three weeks. Dog diapers can help keep your dog clean until the vaginal discharge resolves.
"
"Vulvar fold dermatitis—In cases of vulvar fold dermatitis, the condition commonly recurs if treated topically only. However, for dogs who undergo surgery to remove excess skinfolds, the prognosis is excellent after the surgery sites heal. A dog who has had skinfold surgery should wear a recovery collar to help prevent them from licking the area.
"
"While some vaginal discharge causes are unpreventable, having your female dog spayed significantly reduces the risk of pyometra. It also helps your pup avoid experiencing retained placenta and pregnancy loss.
"
"Unspayed female dogs typically experience a bloody vaginal discharge when they are in heat. However, unless you are certain your dog’s discharge is caused by their heat cycle, you should speak with your vet.
"
"Certain conditions that cause sex hormones to be imbalanced
"
"If your dog has discharge from the vulva or any additional symptoms, your veterinarian will need to determine whether simple vaginitis is the root cause or if there’s an underlying problem (such as an infection or urinary tract abnormality) that needs addressing. This can be determined by a physical examination.
"
"The veterinarian will examine the vulvar area for signs of estrus and infection. He or she may also take a sample of the discharge and analyze it under a microscope to determine if a bacterial infection is present. Your veterinarian may also recommend blood work to rule out more serious conditions, or an imaging test (like an X-ray or ultrasound) to examine the urinary tract. 
"
"In some cases, more advanced diagnostics such as a vaginoscopy (a procedure where a small scope with a camera is used to examine the inside of the genital tract) may be required. Your veterinarian may also elect to collect a sample of any discharge present to culture any abnormal bacteria, or collect a sample of any abnormal looking tissue to have a pathologist evaluate the sampled area.
"
"The best way to treat vaginitis in dogs depends on the severity and underlying cause (if one is known/present). In some instances, such as with puppies that haven’t yet gone through puberty, the condition usually resolves on its own, though you can help by keeping the skin around her vulva clean and dry by using wet, unscented baby wipes after your dog has been playing outside or after it has urinated.
"
"In more severe cases, antibiotics or surgery may be required. Antibiotics are often prescribed when bacterial infections are in the vulva, vagina, or urinary tract. If an anatomical problem is to blame, your dog might need surgery to correct it and prevent future episodes of vaginitis.
"
"An episode of vaginitis may last days to months depending on the cause. In puppies, this problem will often resolve at after their first heat cycle, but that is not always the case. If a structural abnormality is present, your puppy may be susceptible to recurrence and flare ups. Knowing whether your pet has a hooded/inverted vulva will help you determine if your pet is at an increased risk. Keeping the area around her vulva area clean and dry should help, as should preventing your dog from licking the area by having her wear a recovery cone or e-collar.
"
"Uncomplicated puppy vaginitis can resolve on its own, within a few weeks to months or faster with good hygiene care. However, sometimes what seems like vaginitis is really a more serious condition, so always schedule an appointment with your veterinarian and get the issue checked.
"
"It can be irritating and uncomfortable, and frequent licking/chewing of the area may make matters worse. If you notice any swelling, irritation, or signs of discomfort, contact your veterinarian immediately.

"Vascular ring anomalies occur when a congenital abnormality of the heart's blood vessels result in the esophagus being compressed at the level of the base of the heart. This, in turn, prevents solid food from being able to pass properly past the compression as well as the dilatation of the esophagus in front of the compressed area. This is termed megaesophagus. Because food is not moved properly through the esophagus, regurgitation occurs.
"
"German Shepherds, Irish Setters, and Boston Terriers are most commonly affected by vascular ring anomalies. Symptoms of the condition include:
"
"Time between eating and regurgitation varies.
"
"The cause for vascular ring anomalies in dogs is a developmental congenital abnormality.
"
"A thorough physical examination and routine blood testing is usually performed. However, imaging is usually necessary for accurate diagnosis. Imaging may include thoracic radiographs (X-rays), contrast esophagography (usually performed with barium), fluoroscopy and/or angiography.
"
" 
"
"Dogs with aspiration pneumonia may require antibiotics and possibly oxygen supplementation. Surgery to repair the vascular entrapment is indicated. However, the esophagus may be permanently compromised resulting from the entrapment itself, especially if surgical intervention does not take place early enough. In these cases, specialized feeding for megaesophagus (i.e. placing food on an elevated surface or feeding with the dog sitting upright, feeding food processed into a slurry) may be necessary indefinitely.

"While there are many conditions that can cause changes in urination frequency or urine color, urine crystals are one of the more common causes. Occasionally, crystals are present in a dog’s urine without causing any symptoms at all. 
"
"Anytime a dog eats and drinks, nutrients are absorbed and waste products need to be eliminated. Some waste products are broken down and eliminated through stool, while others are eliminated in urine. Urine is made by the kidneys filtering the blood and removing salts, waste products, and water—together, these make up urine. The urine passes from the kidneys through tiny tubes, called ureters, to the bladder. It is then stored in the bladder until it’s time to pee. It then travels out another tube, the urethra, to leave the body.
"
"Normal urine is a balance of water, minerals, acids, and protein breakdown products such as urea. This balance is important. If there is too much of a particular mineral, it will precipitate out into a solid.
"
"Sometimes enough urine crystals form that they clump together and form a sand-like sediment. This sediment can make urination very uncomfortable. It can continue to accumulate until actual bladder stones are formed. They look like pebbles inside the urinary bladder and can lead to extreme discomfort.
"
"As long as your dog is able to urinate and has a good stream of urine, crystals can be addressed over time, often with nutritional management. If at any time, your dog is straining to urinate or not able to urinate, this is considered a medical emergency. Untreated urinary blockages can lead to kidney failure and death when not immediately addressed.

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Crystals are typically not visible to the naked eye. Pet parents are more likely to notice their dog urinating more frequently, seeming to take longer when urinating, only urinating small amounts, or having blood in their urine. Crystals can only be seen under a microscope. Some look like clear, square or rectangular gemstones, while others look more like crystal fireworks or hexagons.
"
"Occasionally, a dog will have enough crystals that they clump together and make a sandy grit or sediment that can be observed in the urine.
"
"Calcium oxalate crystals: This crystal type is one of the most common in dogs. Certain breeds are more genetically predisposed to forming this type of crystal, including Pomeranians, Miniature Schnauzers, Bichon Frise, Maltese, Yorkshire Terriers, Lhasa Apsos, and Miniature Poodles.
"
"Struvite crystals: Another common type, this crystal usually occurs in conjunction with a urinary tract infection (UTI). They are seen more often in younger female dogs, with Labradors, Cocker Spaniels, Shih Tzus and Bichon Frises being more commonly affected.
"
"Ammonium urate crystals: These crystals occur more often in dogs that have liver shunts or a genetic mutation. The Miniature Schnauzer, West Highland White, Yorkshire Terrier, and Pekingese breeds are more likely to get this type of crystal due to liver shunts.
"
"Cystine crystals: This is a rare crystal type. Like urate crystals, cystine crystals are radiolucent, meaning they form into bladder stones and are not visible on X-rays. These crystals develop in dogs that have inherited an issue with their kidneys so that they are unable to reabsorb the cysteine amino acid like normal. This crystal type is often found in Labradors and Newfoundlands.
"
"Frequent urination
"
"Increased drinking
"
"Straining or discomfort when urinating
"
"Blood in urine
"
"Urinary accidents in the house
"
"Discolored urine 
"
"Urinary crystals form in a dog’s bladder when the urine becomes supersaturated with minerals and the pH and concentration favors crystallization. Minerals become supersaturated in the urine due to a combination of genetics, nutrition, and underlying medical conditions.
"
"Genetics are involved in crystal formation. Some dogs are more prone to crystal formation than others, based on how their kidneys break down compounds. 
"
"Nutrition plays a large role in both formation of crystals and treatment/management of urine crystals. Two dogs in the same household may eat the same food, but only one develops urine crystals. This is because the dog has a genetic predisposition to an overabundance of minerals.
"
"Underlying medical conditions can also play a big role in crystal formation in the urine. Urinary tract infections can alter the pH, or acidity, in the bladder as well as cause inflammation and debris to form inside the urinary bladder.
"
"Other medical issues, like high levels of calcium in the blood, can also lead to crystal formation. High levels of calcium in the blood can be caused by other conditions including kidney disease, parathyroid disease, Addison’s disease, and some cancers.
"
"Urine crystals are diagnosed by a veterinarian while examining dog urine under a microscope. If your dog is having issues with abnormal urination, your vet will likely ask you to bring a urine sample into the clinic. The best time to try to catch this urine sample is first thing in the morning. The first morning urine will likely be the most concentrated sample, since your dog has held their bladder all night while sleeping.
"
"To collect your dog’s urine, use a shallow plastic container or soup ladle and slip it under their urine stream while they’re urinating. Your vet will prefer as fresh a urine sample as possible, so ideally, bring a urine sample gathered the same day. If there will be time between when you catch the urine and when you bring it into the veterinary office, store it in the refrigerator until you can bring it in. Once a veterinarian has a urine sample, they will run a complete urinalysis.
"
"Urine crystals are typically managed with some component of nutrition therapy. Sometimes your veterinarian may recommend that you switch your dog’s current diet to an over-the-counter food, but often a prescription diet is recommended. Your veterinarian may prescribe a diet to dissolve crystals or recommend one that has a target pH and mineral composition aimed at minimizing future crystal formation.
"
"Common prescription dissolution urinary diets for struvite crystals include:
"
"Other prescription urinary diets more commonly used for different crystal types include Hill®'s u/d and Royal Canin®/MD UC. 
"
"In some cases, diet therapy is not possible or a veterinarian recommends the addition of oral medications. The medications more commonly prescribed for urine crystals are:
"
"Potassium citrate: helps reduce the formation of calcium oxalate stones by binding calcium rather than leaving it free to precipitate out into crystals
"
"Hydrochlorothiazide: works to minimize calcium oxalate stone formation by decreasing the amount of calcium excreted in urine
"
"DL-methionine: acidifies the urine, helping to dissolve struvites and prevent their formation
"
"Tiopronin: works to bind extra cysteine in the urine and allow it to be eliminated safely
"
"Allopurinol: decreases the production of uric acid to decrease formation of ammonium urate crystals
"
"If a urinary tract infection is also present, such as in the case of struvite crystals, your veterinarian will likely prescribe antibiotics. Often it is recommended that your veterinarian take a culture to help determine the type of bacteria growing in their urinary tract and which antibiotic can best clear the infection. It is important that you follow the instructions on the antibiotic and give it until it is gone.
"
"Recovery from urine crystals varies on the type of crystal and the individual dog. Some crystal types, like struvite, can be treated and eliminated by curing the urinary tract infection and feeding a recommended diet. UTIs are often treated quickly with antibiotic courses lasting anywhere from 5 days to 2 weeks. It is not uncommon, however, for prescription diets to be recommended for the rest of your dog’s life.
"
"Other crystal types may be more challenging to eliminate if a dog has a hereditary predisposition to forming that crystal type. If an underlying medical condition, like hypercalcemia or liver shunts, is present, it is important to manage the medical condition to reduce future formation of crystals.
"
"It is very common for crystals to reoccur in the urine. If a prescription diet is recommended, talk to your veterinarian before taking your pet off that diet. Additionally, if you discontinue the prescription food, rechecking their urine periodically after transitioning to a new diet will help determine if the problem is returning.
"
"While your dog is recovering from urine crystals, watch their urine output daily. If you notice any increase in frequency of urination, straining to urinate, or blood/discoloration to the urine, bring a sample to your veterinarian immediately.
"
"Crystals alone are not usually dangerous when present in dog’s urine. However, if the crystals clump together and form sediment, this can lead to urinary blockage, which is dangerous.
"
"While nutrition plays a big role in crystal formation, there are no specific brands or types of food that cause the problem. Different diets affect dogs in different ways, depending on their genetics and the pH of their urine. If your dog has crystals in their urine, your veterinarian will likely recommend a diet change; however, other dogs in the same household may not have the same problem. Discuss any diet changes with your veterinarian before moving forward.
"
"The majority of crystals in dog’s urine are treated with nutrition therapy, most often with a prescription diet. Sometimes, oral medications will be prescribed to aid in dissolving crystals.

"Involution of the uterus is the process by which the uterus contracts to its non-pregnant size after the delivery of the young. This usually takes 12-15 weeks to complete. Subinvolution, on the other hand, is the failure or delay in this normal process. This problem is more common in female dogs that are younger than three years of age, and/or in dogs that have experienced their first litter. All breeds are equally susceptible to this problem.
"
"This is usually not a significant health problem, but because it resembles other reproductive problems, it must be checked by a veterinarian and differentiated as such.
"
"Generally, no systemic signs are present in these dogs. The only complaint is a sticky discharge from the vulva (vaginal opening) that goes beyond the six-week postpartum period, which provokes the owner to seek medical advice.
"
"Unknown, but young and/or inexperienced dogs appear to be at increased risk.
"
"Your veterinarian will take background medical history and will also conduct a physical examination to evaluate your dog's overall health. The results of the routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, all of which are typically normal in these patients. Diagnostic imaging should be used to view the internal abdomen; X-rays may reveal a thick walled uterus.
"
"
"
"In some patients, the disease symptoms resolve spontaneously before or at the next point in the estrus cycle (i.e., heat). In case of complications, medical therapy may be required to resolve these symptoms. In most cases, there are no complications, but in rare instances, severe anemia is present and a blood transfusion may be required to save the life of the patient. If it appears to be affecting your dog's health in an adverse way, your veterinarian may recommend surgical removal of the ovaries and uterus. If future breeding is not desired, this is the best option. Surgical removal of the uterus and ovaries is normally helpful in permanently resolving the problem.
"
"If, however, you do wish to breed your dog again, and your veterinarian gives you the go-ahead, in most cases, subsequent pregnancies are normal and there are no concerns. This may depend on the overall health of your dog and her response to the breeding process.
"
"Few complications are known to occur in patients with this condition. In the rare instance that there is a complication related to subinvolution, anemia is one of the most likely problems. You will need to closely observe your dog's mucous membranes to make sure that her blood supply is sufficient. Any change in the color of the membranes -- whether they are pale or bluish in color -- should be reported to your veterinarian immediately for further evaluation. Laboratory testing is also recommended for assessing the status of  a possibly anemic condition. Similarly, you will need to watch for any excess discharge from the vagina and report to your veterinarian about the consistency, color and quantity of the discharge.
"
"In cases that are absent of infection, show spontaneous remission, or where surgery has been employed to resolve the issue, the overall prognosis is generally excellent and the patient recovers without any further complications.

"Vaginal malformations are recognized as altered anatomic architecture, which can be due to congenital anomalies such as an imperforate hymen (where the hymen is solid, not allowing fluids through the vaginal canal from the uterus, or normal penetration [such as for breeding]; generally a congenital anomaly); dorsoventral septum (or septae, where the vagina has a vertical dividing membranous wall/partition); hymenal tightening; cysts (a sac with liquid inside); or to acquired conditions, such as vaginal overgrowth, foreign bodies, strictures (tightenings), adhesions (abnormal fibrous tissue sticking to the structures), and cancer.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases. The urinalysis may show evidence of a secondary urinary tract infection. After the initial examination, your veterinarian will perform a gynecological examination as well.
"
"The order in which the procedures are performed is important. They are listed here in the recommended order:
"
"Positive-contrast Vaginography
"
"Abdominal ultrasonography
"
"
"
"Manual dilation of closed hymens or of a mild vaginal narrowing may be performed over a course of several treatments while using an anesthetic on the dog. It usually reduces the medical issue, although it does not resolve clinical signs. Surgery can be used to correct many minor congenital and acquired lesions. Spaying to resolve clinical signs  -- typically exhibited during estrus (heat) -- can be performed in patients with no breeding value. Removal of the vagina and ovariohysterectomy can be performed in patients with no breeding value to resolve concurrent severe vaginitis (at all stages of the estrous cycle).
"
"Although it is very rare, there are occasionally cases in which an animal is diagnosed with a vaginal malformation that has been passed on as a genetic trait. If several dogs in a familial line show similar clinical signs of vaginal malformations, they should all be spayed to prevent the trait from being passed on to the next litter. Some animals with vaginal malformations that are not familial may be bred by artificial insemination. They may then give birth via a planned cesarean section.

"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs are usually caused by bacteria in the urine. There are lower and upper UTIs, but lower UTIs are more common. Lower UTIs affect the bladder and/or, in male dogs, the prostate. Upper UTIs affect the kidneys and/or ureters (the tubes that drain urine from the kidneys to the bladder). 
"
"UTIs in dogs are considered either acute or chronic. Acute UTIs usually occur infrequently and are easy to treat with antibiotics and pain medications. Chronic UTIs are defined as three or more episodes of UTI in a year, or two or more episodes of UTI within a six-month period.
"
"A UTI is also considered chronic if it cannot be fully cleared with antibiotic therapy. Chronic UTIs can be frustrating, and though they are often treated and cleared, they tend to return. 
"

"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Dog UTI symptoms result from inflammation and pain due to bacteria invading the bladder wall.
"
"Signs of a UTI in dogs may include:
"
"Inappropriate urination (such as accidents in the house or dribbling urine)
"
"Frequent urination
"
"Straining to urinate with only a small amount of urine production
"
"Blood in the urine
"
"Increased thirst and urination
"
"In more severe cases, where the infection moves into a dog’s kidneys, you may see:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Lack of appetite
"
"Fever
"
"Vomiting 
"
"There are trillions of bacteria that live in the environment. A dog’s external genitalia hold onto a lot of bacteria from direct contact with the environment, licking/mouth contact, and normal bacteria found on the skin. A UTI forms when bacteria enter a dog’s urethra from their external genitalia and enter their bladder.
"
"A healthy bladder has defense mechanisms that help prevent bacteria from causing an infection. These mechanisms break down most types of bacteria. However, when these mechanisms are not functioning well or are broken down due to this invasion, the bacteria penetrate the bladder wall, causing inflammation and pain. Viruses and fungus can occasionally invade the bladder wall, too, with similar effects. 
"
"Acute UTIs in dogs are usually caused by bacteria going up into the urethra and infecting the bladder.
"
"Chronic UTIs can be due to a number of underlying causes:
"
"Kidney disease
"
"Diabetes mellitus
"
"Bladder stones
"
"Vulvar malformations
"
"Tumors in the urinary tract
"
"Benign polyps in the urinary tract
"
"Congenital issues
"
"Neurologic disease
"
"Cushing’s disease
"
"A urinary incontinence issue
"
"A reaction to immunosuppressive drugs
"
"Any dog breed can develop a urinary tract infection, but female dogs develop UTIs more commonly than male dogs.
"
"Male dogs have longer urethras, requiring the bacteria to travel farther to invade the bladder. Picture the bacteria getting tired on their long trek and either giving up on their journey or dying before they make it to their destination. 
"
"Dog breeds that are prone to bladder stones (cystic calculi) are more prone to UTIs in general—especially chronic, recurrent UTIs. This is due to the stones rolling around in a dog’s bladder and breaking down its defense mechanisms, causing inflammation.
"
"Breeds that are predisposed to chronic UTIs secondary to bladder stones include:
"
"Shih Tzus
"
"Bichon Frisé
"
"Yorkshire Terriers
"
"Dalmatians
"
"Pugs
"
"French Bulldogs
"
"Miniature Schnauzers
"
"Standard Schnauzers
"
"Miniature Poodles
"
"There are many ways to tell if a dog has a UTI and to investigate the underlying causes for why an infection occurred in the first place. It’s important to obtain a definitive diagnosis whenever there is evidence of urinary tract disease, or else UTIs may come back.
"
"Here are the ways that veterinarians test for UTIs in dogs.
"
"There are four methods by which your vet may collect your dog’s urine for UTI testing:
"
"Free catch is when the urine is caught directly as your dog pees.
"
"Tabletop is collecting urine after your dog pees a surface, such as a table.
"
"Cystocentesis is sterilely collecting urine via a needle, suctioning it directly from the bladder. (Oftentimes, this is guided by an ultrasound.)
"
"Urethral catheterization is urine collection via a catheter that’s inserted sterilely.
"
"The best option is cystocentesis, as the most sterile way to obtain a urine sample is directly from the bladder. Remember: Because a large number of bacteria normally live in the environment and on a dog’s external genitalia, tabletop and free-catch sampling may reveal other bacterial contamination that makes it difficult to determine if there is truly a UTI.
"
"There are two main ways your vet can test your dog’s urine for UTIs.
"
"Urinalysis is an important screening tool for dogs, whether a UTI is suspected or not. It is often part of the baseline testing performed on your dog during their annual health examination.
"
"Urinalysis is a general screening test, which examines urine for the following:
"
"pH
"
"Specific gravity (a measurement of the concentrating ability of the kidneys)
"
"Protein
"
"Blood
"
"White blood cells
"
"Glucose (sugar)
"
"Ketones (compounds produced by fat breakdown in the body)
"
"Particles such as cells, bacteria, and crystals
"
"Most commonly, vets diagnose UTIs in dogs by finding elevated counts of white blood cells, blood, and protein in the urine, and a low urine specific gravity. Bacteria are not always seen in urine samples in the early stages of a UTI, as the white blood cells can ingest them, effectively hiding them from microscopic sight. 
"
"A urine culture and susceptibility test is the gold standard for UTI diagnosis and the only test that can truly confirm a UTI in dogs. If your vet suspects your dog has a UTI, they should obtain a sterile urine sample by cystocentesis and send it out for a culture and sensitivity test.
"
"To perform this test, vets incubate a small amount of the urine sample on a special medium plate and monitor it for bacterial growth over 1-3 days. Any growth of bacteria on the medium plate confirms a UTI.
"
"Culture and susceptibility tests also reveal the type and amount of bacteria in the sample. Once this is confirmed, your vet performs antibiotic sensitivity testing to determine which antibiotics are best to treat the type of bacteria present. 
"
"For acute UTIs, many veterinarians will start with a urinalysis and will sometimes even treat it with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. A urine culture and sensitivity test is more reliable, though, and your vet should conduct it before treatment if there is any doubt as to whether a UTI is present.
"
"Treatment with an inappropriate antibiotic or giving your dog an antibiotic without a diagnosed UTI can be detrimental, as it can lead to antibiotic resistance in the future.
"
"For chronic UTIs, your dog will undergo both urinalysis and a urine culture. Often, your vet will perform even further diagnostic testing to investigate underlying causes for the recurrence of the UTI. These tests may include:
"
"Full bloodwork to help to rule out kidney disease, Cushing’s disease, and diabetes mellitus as possible contributing factors.
"
"Abdominal radiographs (x-rays), which can reveal certain types of bladder stones. However, some stones are not visible on x-rays. 
"
"Abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the bladder wall thickness and to identify bladder stones, urethral stones, kidney disease, kidney stones, prostate issues, tumors and benign polyps of the bladder, and prostate issues.
"
"Cystoscopy, which provides direct visualization of the urethra and bladder lining through a sterile procedure performed under general anesthesia. Biopsies of any masses and/or the bladder wall can also be obtained via cystoscopy.
"
"Based on your dog’s urine test results, your vet will prescribe an appropriate antibiotic for you to administer as directed.
"
"For acute UTIs, vets usually prescribe an antibiotic (most commonly a penicillin or fluoroquinolone) for 1-2 weeks. If urine culture and sensitivity testing reveals resistant bacteria, then treatment will include an antibiotic found to fight off that particular bacteria. 
"
"To clear the infection for chronic UTIs, treatment will address the underlying cause. Antibiotics are usually prescribed for 4-8 weeks and are based on urine culture and sensitivity to avoid antibiotic resistance. In rare instances of chronic UTIs, your vet may prescribe a lifelong antibiotic for your dog’s comfort.
"
"Your vet may also prescribe pain medications, anti-inflammatories, and probiotic supplements to help treat and clear the infections.
"
"Your vet should test your dog’s urine following antibiotic therapy for both acute and chronic UTIs. In some instances of chronic UTIs, urine testing will also be performed during treatment, in addition to afterward, to assess the amount of bacteria.
"
"Once urine testing confirms that a UTI is resolved, no further treatment is necessary for dogs with acute UTIs. If your dog has a chronic UTI, they may be kept on urinary tract supplements and probiotics to avoid recurrence. 
"
"If your vet diagnoses an underlying medical condition, treatment will aim to control it to avoid recurrent UTIs. Here are a few examples of possible underlying issues and their potential treatments:
"
"Diabetes mellitus: insulin therapy and diet changes
"
"Kidney disease: diet changes, blood pressure management, and fluid therapy (depending on the stage of the disease)
"
"Abnormal vulvar conformation: surgical correction and/or daily cleaning of the perivulvar region (genitalia)
"
"Urinary crystals: increased water intake, urinary tract supplements, and sometimes a dissolution diet (one that helps dissolve crystals)
"
"Bladder stones: surgical removal via cystotomy, or in some cases, a dissolution diet (to help dissolve bladder stones)
"
"Urinary tract masses: surgical removal and/or chemotherapeutic protocols
"
"Each dog with a UTI should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis since there are so many factors that can contribute to pain and inflammation. 
"
"Urine testing for UTIs includes a urinalysis and urine culture with sensitivity. If your vet suspects underlying medical conditions are causing chronic UTIs, your dog may undergo full bloodwork, abdominal radiographs (x-rays), and an abdominal ultrasound and/or cystoscopy as well.
"
"Usually, dogs begin to show improvement within 48-72 hours of starting appropriate antibiotic therapy. Pain medication can help discomfort and straining almost immediately.
"
"UTIs are treated with antibiotics, pain medications, and probiotics. Vets prescribe an antibiotic based on urine testing results to achieve the best outcome and avoid antibiotic resistance. For chronic UTIs in dogs, the underlying cause must also be treated.
"
"Food does not cause UTIs in dogs. However, certain foods can change the pH of the urine and make dogs prone to the formation of urinary crystals or bladder stones. Crystals and stones cause inflammation in the bladder that can eventually lead to UTIs.
"
"Male neutered dogs rarely develop UTIs. Male intact dogs are at risk for prostate issues, which can lead to UTIs. Underlying diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, Cushing’s disease, neurologic issues, bladder stones, and bladder masses (benign or malignant tumors) increase the risk of UTI in male dogs.
"
"The best antibiotic for UTIs in dogs is based on urine culture and sensitivity results. Amoxicillin, Clavamox®, trimethoprim sulfa, and enrofloxacin are the most common antibiotics used to treat UTIs in dogs.
"
"Frequent (chronic) UTIs in dogs are almost always caused by an underlying medical issue. These include kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, bladder stones, vulvar malformations, tumors in the urinary tract, benign polyps in the urinary tract, congenital issues, fecal and urinary incontinence, neurologic disease that causes the bladder to not completely empty, Cushing’s disease, reactions to immunosuppressive drugs, and urinary incontinence issues.
"
"Stress is not considered a common cause of UTIs in dogs. Severe stress can possibly cause UTIs in dogs by depressing the immune system or causing urinary retention, but this has not been scientifically proven.

"Urolithiasis is a medical term referring to the presence of stones or crystals in an animal's urinary tract. When the stones are made up of uric acid, they are called urate stones. These stones can also be found in the kidneys and in the tubes connecting the kidneys to the animal's bladder (ureters).
"
"While these stones can affect any dog breed, Dalmatians, English Bulldogs, and Yorkshire Terriers are more susceptible to the condition. It is also more common in male dogs than in females, and typically noticed within the first three to four years of life.
"
"It is highly likely the stones will recur after treatment, but the overall prognosis for the animal is positive.
"
"While many dogs will not show any signs of the disease, the most common symptoms usually deal with urination issues. These can include abnormal urine streams, difficulty urinating (dysuria), blood in the urine, cloudy urine, and eventually the complete inability to urinate (anuria).
"
"Dogs that have an abnormal connection of the main blood vessel in the liver, called a portosystemic shunt, have a higher incidence of developing these types of stones in the urinary tract. A diet consisting of high amounts of purine -- found in beef, poultry and fish -- can also cause this condition.
"
"Ultrasounds are often performed to determine the size, shape, and location of the stones. This will help your veterinarian to determine an appropriate treatment regimen. Bloodwork will also be performed to determine if there are any underlying medical conditions causing the stones.
"
"If your dog is unable to urinate because of a blockage, surgery is often required. In the event the dog has an abnormal connection of the main blood vessel in its liver -- as mentioned above -- surgery can be performed to re-route blood flow.
"
"Medications are sometimes prescribed to dissolve the stones; this method takes about four weeks to completely resolve the condition.
"
"To monitor for the recurrence of stones, ultrasounds and X-rays should be performed every two to six months. If caught early, the stones are generally easy to treat without the need for surgery.
"
"A low purine diet has shown some promise in the prevention of the formation of these stones.

"Urolithiasis is a medical term referring to the presence of crystals or stones in the urinary tract. When the stones are made up of cystine – a normal compound found in the body – they are called cystine stones. These stones can also be found in the kidneys and in the tubes connecting the kidneys to the animal's bladder (ureters).
"
" 
"
"Urolithiasis affects both dogs and cats, and are primarily found in adult animals. As far as dogs breeds: Dachshunds, English Bulldogs, Newfoundlands, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, and Welsh Corgi Dogs are more susceptible to cystine stones. On the other hand, Siamese and domestic shorthairs show the highest likelihood for stone formation in cats.
"
"In most cases, the stones can be dissolved and removed without surgery, giving the animal a positive prognosis.
"
"Typical symptoms can include increased frequency of urination (pollakiuria), difficulty or painful urination (dysuria), and an abnormal flow of urine (post-renal uremia).
"
"The exact cause for urolithiasis is not currently known. In some animals, however, the inability to process proteins or amino acids has led to the development of cystine stones.
"
"Ultrasounds and X-rays are often performed to determine the size, shape, and location of the stones, helping the veterinarian come up with an appropriate treatment regimen. A urine test can also detect the presence of stones.
"
"In some cases, a scope with a camera on the end (urethrascope) is used to examine the inside of the urinary tract for any abnormalities.
"
"The veterinarian will usually recommend using treatment options such as a special diet and medication -- N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine (2-MPG) -- to reduce and eliminate the stones without surgery.
"
"Follow all recommended dietary changes and administer prescribed medication. This will help prevent a recurrence of the stones. It is also important to bring the animal back to the veterinarian's office to ensure the stones have been successfully dissolved.
"
"There are currently no known preventive measures for this medical condition.

"Rhabdomyosarcoma is a very rare type of malignant and metastasizing (spreading) tumor derived from stem cells, or originating in the striated muscle that surrounds the developing Müllerian or Wolffian ducts. Müllerian ducts begin as two ducts in the female embryo, developing into the vagina, uterus and oviducts. Wolffian ducts begin in the male embryo, developing into the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles through the penis (vas deferens).
"
"Rhabdomyosarcoma of the urinary bladder may also be reported as botryoid rhabdomyosarcomas due to their tendency to take on the appearance of grape clusters. They often spread to the internal organs, and to the lymph nodes.
"
"Idiopathic (unknown)
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. If rhabdomyosarcoma is in fact present, the urinalysis will show bloody urine, and a cytologic (microscopic) examination of urine sediment will indicate rhabdomyosarcoma.
"
"The bladder may be internally examined using ultrasound, or double-contrast cystourethrography imaging (which uses an injection of dye into the bladder and urethra to show the structures more distinctly). An intravenous pyelography can also be used for examining the kidney and bladder, to evaluate any trigonal mass, and to assess the ureters (the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder), and the renal pelvis (the center of the kidney where the urine funnels into the ureters). This method also uses the injection of a dye to visually examine the internal structure of these organs.
"
"A definitive diagnosis can be made from an examination of the diseased tissue (histopathology) using tissue samples (biopsies) obtained from exploratory surgery, or from cystoscopy – an examination of the bladder and ureters, performed by inserting a tube through the urethra.
"
"
"
"Surgical removal of the rhabdomyosarcoma is recommended, but it is difficult to perform, since these tumors are highly invasive. If the bladder is also inflamed due to a bacterial infection, antibiotics will be prescribed based on culture and sensitivity tests.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to follow your dog's progress every three weeks during chemotherapy therapy, and every three months after the chemotherapy course has ended.

"Urolithiasis is a condition in which stones (uroliths) are formed in the urinary tract. There are various types of these stones seen in dogs -- among them, those made from calcium phosphate. Also known as apatite uroliths, calcium phosphate stones are more often found the kidneys than the urinary bladder.
"
"The symptoms may vary depending on the location, size, and number of stones within the urinary tract. In fact, some dogs display no outwardly visible signs of the issue; it is only discovered later during a routine checkup, if at all. The following are some typical symptoms associated with calcium phosphate urolithiasis:
"
"After completing a complete medical history of your animal, your veterinarian will perform a physical exam on the dog, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Although the results of these tests may be normal, there are exceptions. In some dogs, the biochemistry profile may show abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood. In dogs with severe kidney damage or urinary tract blockage, high levels of waste products like urea may be found in the blood.
"
"Biochemical changes related to underlying disease are also helpful in diagnosing the underlying disease or condition. Additionally, microscopic urine examination is useful in identifying the type of stone.
"
"
"
"As there is no effective medications available for this type of stone, dissolution of the stone is the mainstay of treatment. Surgery may be required to remove the stones from the urinary tract, especially in cases in which other procedures cannot be used.
"
"A urinary tract blockage, or obstruction, is a medical emergency that causes a dog to have difficulty urinating or to even be unable to urinate. A dog’s urinary tract includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, and an obstruction can be partial or complete. With an obstruction, dogs will strain and produce little to no urine.
"
"This condition can happen in both male and female dogs, although it is more common in males because of the way their anatomy is structured. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to be eliminated from the body. In male dogs, the urethra is longer and narrower than in females, which predisposes them to this very serious medical condition.
"
"When dogs’ urinary tracts are obstructed, a rapid buildup of toxins occurs. If left untreated, it will lead to kidney failure and death. A urinary tract obstruction is most often caused by a stone formed in the bladder that gets stuck in the urethra, preventing urine from leaving the bladder.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Clinical signs vary depending on the severity of the blockage. Dogs that have only a partial obstruction may:
"
"Urinate small amounts frequently
"
"Take a long time to be able to urinate
"
"Strain to urinate
"
"In some cases, the stones can be pushed back into the bladder if they are causing urethral obstruction. A technique called urohydropropulsion is often used for this purpose. This technique involves using a special urinary catheter inserted into the urethra to push back the stone into the bladder.
"
"There is also a new technique called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, which is minimally invasive. This technique works by producing shockwaves focused on the stone leading to breakage of the stone and subsequent expulsion through urine.
"
"After removal of stone by either technique, your veterinarian will use appropriate radiographic procedures to verify complete removal of stones. Abdominal x-rays or ultrasound are typically utilized at three to five month intervals to enhance early detection of stone formation to prevent repeat surgery.
"
"It is also important that the underlying cause of the stone formation be treated properly to prevent future episodes from occurring.
"
"Typically, your veterinarian will prescribe a new diet plan for your dog. Such plans will help prevent future episodes from occurring. Likewise, it is important that you do not alter your dog's diet drastically without prior consultation with your veterinarian.

"
"Have bloody or dark urine
"
"Be unable to have a steady stream of urine (urinate in drops)
"
"Have inappropriate urination
"
"If the urethra is completely blocked, dogs may have:
"
"Straining to urinate with no urine production
"
"Lethargy, severe depression
"
"Loss of appetite
"
"Vomiting
"
"Enlargement in abdomen
"
"It is difficult to tell the difference between a urinary tract infection and a partial obstruction, but your veterinarian will be able to determine the problem during an exam.
"
"Both partial and complete urinary obstructions are painful and will cause a dog to vocalize when they try to urinate. They may also be restless and have trouble getting comfortable when lying down or have difficulty getting up once down. Dogs may also appear to be constipated, as straining to urinate and straining to defecate can cause the same postures.
"
"The most common cause of urinary tract obstructions in dogs is bladder stones (calculi) that get stuck in the urethra. Stones can also form in the kidneys and get stuck in the ureters, but this is uncommon.
"
"Other causes of urinary obstructions can be related to muscle spasms in the urethra, inflammation (swelling) of the bladder (cystitis), mucus plugs, prostate disease in males, scar tissue, blood clots, or certain cancers. An obstruction can also occur in male dogs when the os penis (bone within the penis that the urethra passes through) is fractured or broken.
"
"With a complete obstruction, the bladder can get so enlarged that it can rupture and spill urine into the abdomen. Dogs with complete urethral obstruction will die within days if the blockage is not relieved. Your dog should be seen by a veterinarian immediately if they are unable to urinate.
"
"Dogs with certain medical conditions can have an increased risk of developing stones and a possible obstruction. Yorkshire Terriers and Schnauzers with liver shunts will form stones from waste not removed by the liver properly. Dalmatians have a genetic predisposition to form urate crystals. Kidney, bladder, and prostate infections can increase the risk of struvite crystals and stones forming.
"
"Either your dog’s veterinarian or an emergency vet will take a complete medical history and perform a full physical examination to include palpation (touching) of the urinary bladder within a dog’s abdomen. Often, a distended (enlarged) bladder and even stones in the bladder will be felt during this exam.
"
"A rectal examination is also important to feel stones in the urethra and, in male dogs, a vet can evaluate the prostate. Full bloodwork, urinalysis, and urine culture must be done to assess the kidneys for evidence of failure and to detect an infection or crystals in the urine.
"
"Imaging of the urinary system is important for checking if a dog has an obstruction. Plain x-rays and x-rays using contrast are very valuable to look for stones within the bladder or urethra. An ultrasound of the abdomen will also be helpful to assess the kidneys for stones or changes such as tumors, clots, or stones that do not show up on x-ray. An ultrasound can also look at the prostate in male dogs to see if it is enlarged or abnormal.
"
"The ultimate sign of a urinary obstruction will be if a urinary catheter cannot be put from the urethra into the bladder. Most, if not all, dogs need to be sedated in order to pass a urinary catheter. Occasionally, the vet will be able to feel the stone (or other cause) with the catheter and figure out if it is a partial or complete obstruction. Your vet can place a special contrast or dye into the catheter while your dog has an x-ray done to look for narrowing of the urethra that can be associated with tumors, clots, or scar tissue.
"
"If there is evidence that the kidneys are not functioning properly and their potassium levels are high, an ECG (electrocardiogram) should be done, as high potassium levels can cause heart problems.
"
"Urinary obstruction in dogs usually requires medical treatment to stabilize them for surgery and then surgical treatment to release the obstruction. Your dog will be hospitalized with an IV catheter to receive IV fluids and pain medications. Antibiotics are needed if there is evidence of infection, and other medications can be given to help with urethral muscle spasms, inflammation, etc.
"
"Once they are stable, a dog can be sedated and a urinary catheter will be placed into the urethra. In some obstructions caused by bladder stones, the stone can be pushed from the urethra into the bladder to relieve the obstruction. A much less complicated surgery can then be performed to remove the stone from the bladder.
"
"If the stone cannot be passed into the bladder with the catheter or the underlying cause is not a stone, surgical removal/correction of the blockage directly from the urethra will need to be done. If any abnormal tissue is present or if a tumor is causing the obstruction, your vet will be able to take a biopsy at the time of surgery when the obstruction is resolved.
"
"There are many different bladder stones, and some might not need surgery as they can be dissolved with a special prescription dog food diet. A cystoscope can sometimes be used to remove small stones from the bladder instead of doing surgery. 
"
"Dogs will need several weeks of restricted activity and wearing an Elizabethan collar (cone) after surgery to remove a urinary obstruction. After surgery on the urinary tract, blood in the urine can remain for a few weeks depending on which surgical procedure is performed.
"
"Most urinary tract infections should be treated for a minimum of 10-14 days with antibiotics. Pain and anti-inflammatory medications are also given after the obstruction is cleared. Repeat urinalysis and urine cultures must be done after the medications are finished to be sure the infection was treated properly.
"
"Complications of urinary obstruction include tears in the urethra or bladder, resulting in urine leakage, bladder dysfunction, incontinence, or scarring in the urethra that can cause recurrence of the obstruction.
"
"The prognosis is good for dogs that undergo most surgical or nonsurgical procedures to relieve a urinary blockage if they have not endured significant kidney or toxic damage from a prolonged obstruction.
"
"Prevention is possible in some cases of bladder stones, depending on their chemical makeup. If the stones were formed because of infection, it’s best to have routine urinalysis and urine cultures done to detect infection before the stone develops and decide if antibiotics should be prescribed. Periodic bladder x-rays or ultrasounds would also be helpful to prevent recurrence of a urinary obstruction. Early detection may allow your veterinarian to adjust your dog's diet or medications before they need surgery.
"
"Yes, the primary symptom of a urinary obstruction, straining to urinate, is a response to the pain the dog is feeling in the bladder and urethra especially. The pain from a urethral stone is likely similar to what people feel when they have kidney stones, which is usually extreme. No matter what the cause of the urinary obstruction, it causes pain and discomfort to all dogs.

"An  ectopic (displaced) ureter is a congenital abnormality in which one or both ureters open into the urethra or vagina. Bilateral ectopia affects both ureters,  and unilateral ectopia affects one ureter. Dogs affected with ectopic ureter will have the tubular shaft bypass the bladder floor (trigone) and enter through the bladder wall. Less frequently, the ureter opens into the bladder floor and continues as a trough into the urethra. 
"
"The following dog breeds may be predisposed to displaced ureter: Labrador Retriever, Golden retriever, Siberian husky, Newfoundland, Bulldog, West Highland White Terrier, Fox Terrier, and Miniature and Toy Poodles.
"
"This condition is rare, especially in male dogs. Occasionally, a dog with this abnormality may be asymptomatic and show no apparent urination problems. However, some common symptoms to look out for include occasional or continuous incontinence, and inflammation of the vagina (vaginitis) from urine scalding the vaginal tissue.
"
"Ectopic ureter has an unknown mode of inheritance, but there does appear to be a component of breed predisposition.
"
"An upset stomach can be caused by a wide variety of conditions in dogs, some serious and some less significant. 
"
"An upset stomach in a dog, as with people, is caused by an abnormality in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The digestive system consists of organs that receive and process food, including the esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, rectum, and anus.
"
"While an upset stomach is common in dogs, it’s not easy to judge what symptoms would warrant a visit to the veterinarian and what can be remedied at home.
"
"Gastroenteritis is the medical term used when inflammation or irritation is present in the stomach or intestinal tract. Symptoms of an upset stomach are often transient, lasting only a day or two.
"
"However, they may also persist, which indicates the possibility of a more serious problem. Symptoms lasting longer than two days require medical intervention by your vet.
"
"Some causes of an upset stomach in dogs can be emergencies, especially if there is blood in the vomit or stool (i.e., hemorrhagic gastroenteritis).
"
"Your veterinarian will use a diagnostic technique called urethrocystoscopy, which uses an insertable tube with an attached camera. In this way, the veterinarian will be able to examine the dog's bladder internally, and visualize the opening into the urethra or vagina. Your veterinarian will also be looking to identify holes (perforations) in the structure of the urethra (urethral fenestrations), depressions, striping (or streaking), and tenting in the bladder.
"
"When this diagnostic method is performed skillfully, a more accurate diagnosis can be made than with external imaging techniques, such as X-rays. Another technique, urethral pressure profilometry, measures surface variations to detect coexistent urethral muscle (sphincter) incompetence. There remains the possibility that a displaced ureter will confound the results of this test, however.
"
"  
"
"
"
"Treatment for repairing an ectopic ureter will involve surgically creating a new ureteral opening into the bladder, or removing a blocked or severely infected kidney. A portion of the displaced ureter will need to be removed, if feasible, and the ureter opening (ureterocele) into the bladder then repaired.
"
"Incontinence may continue if your dog also has urethral muscle incompetence, and will be weakened to some degree during recovery from surgery. Some puppies with urethral muscle incompetence are able to control urination after their first heat cycle. Additionally, incontinent dogs should not be spayed before their first heat.
"
"Your veterinarian will need to evaluate the effectiveness of the surgery in a follow-up visit. Internal imaging of the dog's urinary organs and bladder using dye injection through the  vaginal canal (for females) will follow the track of the fluid and will make it possible to visually inspect the healing of the surgical site. Surgically elevating the vagina to support the bladder neck (where the urethra and bladder join) using the colposuspension technique may correct the incontinence.
"
"If incontinence persists, phenylpropanolamine, an alpha-blocker, may be prescribed to enhance urinary flow, or to relieve tension and pain, a tricyclic antidepressor agent such as imipramine can be prescribed. Reproductive chemical hormone therapy may increase the naturally occurring sensitivity of urethral stress response receptors. The nonsteroidal estrogen Diethylstilbestrol, meanwhile, is administered orally to spayed bitches for urethral muscle control. In some females, a combination of estrogen therapy and phenylpropanolamine, for controlling incontinence, may be more effective. 
"
"In incontinent male dogs, steroid therapy may be prescribed. Testosterone propionate is administered initially to see if replacement therapy will be effective. For longer action, testosterone cypionate is used.
"
"Reproductive hormone therapy is not advised in immature animals.

"If your dog has an upset stomach, your veterinarian will start with a complete physical exam and medical history.
"
"Be honest with your vet about any new food, treats, or table food your dog has ingested. It’s also important to let them know about any potential toxins your dog may have gotten into, including medications, house plants, cleaners, chemicals, drugs, or rat poison.
"
"When you take your dog to the vet for an upset stomach, bring a fresh sample of their stool for parasite testing. If you think your dog got into a toxic food item or substance, bring the packaging so your vet can assess the ingredients.
"
"Your veterinarian may perform diagnostic testing to determine the underlying cause of your dog’s symptoms. Bloodwork, including a complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry panel, is performed.
"
"In addition to bloodwork, fecal screening for abnormal bacteria and urine testing are often done. An X-ray or ultrasound of the abdomen may also be performed to assess your dog’s internal organs, including the digestive system.
"
"Depending on the results of this testing, more specific blood or fecal testing may be recommended to look for specific conditions, such as parvovirus, pancreatitis, or salmonellosis.
"
"If these tests are inconclusive and your dog's symptoms persist, more advanced diagnostics—such as endoscopy, exploratory surgery, or biopsy of the GI tract—may be performed.
"
"Treatment for your dog’s upset stomach depends on how long it has been an issue and the underlying cause.
"
"If your dog has had an upset stomach for less than 48 hours and they are still eating and drinking, not lethargic, and have no blood in their feces or vomit, you can try to manage the issue at home.
"
"You can feed small amounts of a bland diet, such as boiled white-meat chicken and white rice with no salt, fat, or seasonings.
"
"If your dog is having diarrhea, you can add fiber by giving canned 100% pumpkin puree or a fiber powder. Probiotics can also help relieve an upset stomach.
"
"If your dog’s upset stomach has persisted for longer than 48 hours or if they have any symptoms in addition to vomiting and diarrhea, they should be treated by a veterinarian.
"
"Treatment can range from oral medications sent home with you to hospitalization and intensive care. Common treatments include:
"
"IV fluids for dehydration
"
"Antibiotics for diarrhea or a bacterial infection
"
"Antinausea medication, such as Cerenia®
"
"Antacids such as omeprazole or famotidine
"
"Probiotics and fiber supplementation
"
"Pain medication, which may be oral or injectable (depends on a pup’s symptoms)
"
"Plasma or blood transfusions
"
"Steroids such as prednisone
"
"Deworming or antiparasitic medications
"
"Depending on the severity and cause of your dog’s upset stomach, your vet may recommend a period of fasting to rest your dog’s digestive system.
"
"Other times it might be necessary to place a feeding tube to ensure your dog receives proper nutrition for recovery. A special diet, such as a low-fat or hydrolyzed protein diet, may be instituted to help with your dog’s upset stomach. If the diet helps, your vet may recommend that you continue feeding it long-term.
"
"If your dog has a foreign object blocking their stomach or intestines, your vet will recommend surgery to remove it. If your dog has ingested a toxin, your vet may induce vomiting or administer activated charcoal.
"
"Your dog’s recovery from an upset stomach may take a few days to a few weeks, depending on the cause.
"
"Some underlying causes, such as inflammatory bowel disease, can require life-long management with treatments such as oral medication, probiotics, fiber, and a special diet.
"
"While your dog recovers from an upset stomach, it’s important to give them plenty of rest and affection. Take them on enough walks to prevent accidents in the house, but not so many that they get overtired. Avoid playdates with other dogs and too much activity with their housemates. If your dog eats too quickly, you may consider a slow feeder bowl.
"
"To prevent your dog from developing an upset stomach, ensure they eat only the recommended portion of their regular dog food. Table scraps, especially high-fat or toxic foods, are not recommended for dogs. If you need to change your dog's diet, it’s always best to consult your veterinarian and slowly transition the diet over 7 to 10 days.
"
"If your dog frequently visits dog parks or doggy day care, wipe down their paws before they have a chance to lick them, to help prevent ingestion of any contagious microbes.
"
"Dogs with an upset stomach are often restless and don’t lie down for long. You may also notice signs of abdominal pain, such as stretching excessively with the front legs on the floor and the hind legs standing up.

"Ureterolithiasis is a condition involving the formation of stones that may lodge into and block a dog's ureter, the muscular tube that connects the kidney to the bladder and carries urine from kidneys to the bladder. Typically, the stones originate in the kidneys and pass down into the ureter.
"
"Depending on the size and shape of the stone, the stone may pass down to the bladder without any resistance or it may partially or completely obstruct the ureter, resulting in the dilatation of the upper portion of the ureter and subsequent kidney damage.
"
"There are a number of different types of stones found in animals and type of stone may vary in according to breeds, age, and sex of the dog.
"
"Some dogs with ureterolithiasis display no symptoms, especially during the initial stages. Otherwise, be attentive to the following symptoms:
"
"The underlying cause may vary depending on the type of the stone. Typical causes include:
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct a complete medical history and perform a physical examination on your dog. He or she will then use routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to assess the condition of your dog and severity of the disease. These tests also help in evaluating your pet for any other concurrent disease or condition.

"Abdominal X-rays are extremely useful in visualizing the stones and their size; it will also confirm if the kidney has become enlarged as a result of the stones. Similarly, X-rays will depict if the ureter is intact or ruptured. In some cases, a special dye is injected intravenously and X-rays are taken afterward. This helps better visualize the stones by providing contrast. Ultrasound scans is another method for detecting ureter stones and kidney size.
"
"
"
"Removing the obstructing stones is the primary objective of treatment. Fortunately, advances in modern technology has enabled veterinarians to remove the stones without surgery. A new technique called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy  removes stones located in kidney, ureter, or bladder by producing shockwaves that break apart the stones, which can then be passed through the urine. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy technique does not work for all animals, so consult with your veterinarian if it is right for your dog.
"
"For dogs in which surgery is necessary, intravenous fluids are administered to maintain them hydrated. Antibiotics are also prescribed for dogs with concurrent urinary tract infection.
"
"As relapses are common, continuous monitoring of the dog's condition is necessary. Typically, followup evaluations are done every 3-6 months. Depending on the type of stone, your veterinarian will suggest dietary changes to prevent future episodes of stone formation. If your dog is not tolerating the dietary changes well, contact him or her for necessary changes.
"
"The overall prognosis is highly variable depending on the type of the stones.

"Ciliary dyskinesia is a congenital disorder caused by ciliary dysfunction. The cilia are complex hairlike structures, capable of movement, that line various body organs, including the upper and lower respiratory tracts, auditory tubes, ventricles of the brain, spinal canal, uterine tube, and the ducts of the testes. The main function of the cilia is to move cells, or to move the surrounding fluids. They also serve as a kind of filter. In the respiratory tract, the cilia work to remove dust and other material from inhaled air before it is moved into the lungs. Ciliary beating (the process of movement) is normally coordinated by an intricate interaction of numerous proteins contained within each cilium. Movement is characteristically uncoordinated (dyskinetic) or absent in dogs affected with ciliary dyskinesia; the affected cilia will often have structural lesions.
"
"Clinical signs predominate in ciliated organs: a lack of mucociliary (interaction of mucus and cilia) clearance in the respiratory tract can lead to recurrent bacterial rhinosinusitis, bronchopneumonia and auditory canal (ear) infection, as well as chronic inflammation and obstruction of the airways. It can also lead to male infertility (live sperm that are incapable of movement). Hydrocephalus (fluid in the brain), and situs inversus (organs on opposite side than normal) are common albeit variable features of ciliary dyskinesia. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the absence of tracheal mucociliary clearance and the presence of a specific lesion in respiratory cilia or sperm flagella. It is established in patients without ciliary lesions by analysis of ciliary function. Dogs with chronic respiratory tract disease and situs inversus will in all probability have primary ciliary dyskinesia and do not warrant an extensive workup.
"
"This is a genetic disease with a probable autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Signs typically develop at an early age, from a few days old to five weeks of age. Some dogs, however, will remain asymptomatic for prolonged periods; from six months to ten years. Ciliary dyskinesia, in particular, has been reported only in purebred dogs - bichon frises, border collies, bull mastiffs, Chihuahuas, shar peis, chow chows, Dalmatians, Doberman pinschers, English cocker spaniels, English pointers, English setters, English springer spaniels, golden retrievers, Gordon setters, long-haired dachshunds, miniature poodles, Old English sheepdogs, Newfoundlands, rottweilers, and Staffordshire bull terriers.
"
"There are a number of ailments with the same, or similar, symptoms, so your veterinarian will need to conduct various tests to determine a diagnosis, beginning with a biopsy of the nasal or bronchial mucous. Specific lesions must be found in a high percentage of cilia, and the same defect must be found in cilia from multiple locations (e.g., nasal and bronchial cilia, and sperm flagella), as well as from affected litter-mates before a diagnosis of an inherited defect can be made.
"
"An analysis of ciliary beat frequency and synchrony will be used to confirm the diagnosis. An electrocardiogram -- a recording of the electrical activity of the heart -- can be used to confirm situs inversus (organs on opposite sides than normal).
"
"
"
"The sheer force produced by exhalation and coughing can clear airway secretions, so routine exercise may enhance mucus clearance by increasing respiration and inducing coughing. Supplemental oxygen therapy may be needed during acute episodes of life-threatening bronchopneumonia. Antibiotics will be prescribed for respiratory infections on the basis of bacterial culture and sensitivity testing. It may be continued indefinitely, although it may possibly become ineffective because of a buildup of bacterial resistance. Anesthesia is risky with these patients because the ability to breath is impaired.
"
"High ambient temperature may produce hyperthermia and potential heat stroke because of reduced capacity for evaporative heat loss through the lungs. Cysts in the chest may develop from prolonged air entrapment in the pleural cavity, which can then rupture and produce a pneumonic condition in the lungs. Other aftereffects are also possible. For these reasons, you will need to carefully observe and monitor your pet, and schedule frequent checkups with your veterinarian.

"An umbilical hernia is an opening in the muscle wall where the umbilicus (belly button) is located. The hernia allows the abdominal contents to pass through the opening.
"
"Umbilical hernias may be complicated or uncomplicated. A complicated hernia is one in which contents of the abdominal cavity, such as a loop of intestine, have passed through the opening and become entrapped.
"
"An uncomplicated umbilical hernia is associated with a soft swelling in the umbilical area. This swelling may be variable in size and may come and go. Otherwise, the dog will appear health.
"
"Symptoms seen with a complicated umbilical hernia may include:
"
"Most umbilical hernias in dogs are probably inherited although trauma can also be a cause. Some breeds of dogs, including Airedales, Pekingese, and basenji are predisposed to umbilical hernias.
"
"Umbilical hernias can usually be diagnosed by finding the swelling caused by the hernia on a physical examination. However, sometimes contrast radiographs (x-rays) or an abdominal ultrasound are needed to determine which abdominal contents, if any, are entrapped.
"
"
"
"Treatment of an umbilical hernia involves surgical correction of the opening and replacement of abdominal contents if necessary. Some umbilical hernias will, however, close spontaneously, usually by 6 months of age.
"
"Small umbilical hernias may not need surgical correction but larger hernias should be repaired to remove the risk of complications.
"
"Because many umbilical hernias are hereditary, pets with these hernias should not be bred.

"The spleen exists as a filter to destroy excess red blood cells, and as a reservoir for blood. It is a main support to the immune system. Splenic torsion, or twisting of the spleen, may occur by itself, or in association with gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) syndrome, when a dog’s air-filled stomach expands and twists on itself. It can occur suddenly, or it can gradually twist over a period of time.
"
"Dogs are rarely affected by an abnormality such as splenic torsion. When it does occur, however, it most commonly seen in large-breed, deep-chested dogs, like German shepherds, standard poodles, and great Danes.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on the patient, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition.
"
"A coagulation test may show prolonged bleeding times, which would indicate a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (clotting within multiple veins throughout the system), a serious end-stage disease of the cardiovascular system.
"
"Abdominal x-ray images may reflect a mass, and/or an abnormally located spleen. An abdominal ultrasound may be used for a more sensitive imaging of the spleen. Your veterinarian may also want to use an electrocardiogram to trace blood flow, a blockage in the flow may show as arrhythmias of the heart.
"
"
"
"Dogs with GDV should be considered a surgical emergency. After fluid therapy and medical treatment, a surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy) should be performed. At this time, the stomach will need to be surgically affixed, or it may flip again at a later date. A splenic sample should be submitted for histopathologic examination (laboratory study of abnormal tissue). Fluid support and cardiovascular monitoring will be provided after splenectomy.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your dog's progress. Post-surgery infection is a serious issue of concern. You will need to monitor the surgical site for cleanliness. Follow your veterinarian's instructions for proper methods of cleaning a post-surgery wound. If you observe any redness, swelling, itching, or oozing at the site, you will need to contact your veterinarian. Because the spleen plays a role in the immune system, there is some concern that the absence of the spleen may place an animal at an increased risk of infection. You may wish to talk with your veterinarian about ways to strengthen your dog's immune system, or to protect it from injury and illness.
"
"If your dog shows symptoms of GDV again, call your veterinarian immediately for advisement.

"Most types of injectable vaccine and non-vaccine products have rarely been associated with sarcoma development in dogs, but some dogs may develop a site specific sarcoma following rabies vaccination. In fact, reports of a sarcoma (a cancerous mass arising from bone, cartilage, fat or muscle) developing at the site of vaccine injection sites in some animals have led to the suspicion of a link between the vaccine and a disposition in some animals to this type of reaction.
"
"These tumors are characterized as highly invasive, rapidly growing, and malignant. Metastatic (spreading) rates are reported to be 22.5 to 24 percent. Often, the cancer spreads to the lungs, but it may spread to the regional lymph nodes and to the skin as well.
"
"The cause for the sarcoma development is unknown, but it is believed that local inflammation must first occur for the malignant mass to follow. In addition, initial reports focused on vaccine adjuvants (assisting ingredients) containing aluminum as a potential cause of the sarcoma. However, the role of aluminum is unclear because not all adjuvants used in the vaccines that have been associated with sarcoma formation have contained aluminum.
"
"Lesions occur at the site of the vaccination, persisting and/or growing in size. In the advanced stages, the lesions will become fixed and occasionally ulcerated.
"
"Vaccination with the rabies vaccine appears the be the underlying cause of this type of sarcoma. Moreover, the risk of developing the tumors may increase with the frequency and number of vaccinations given.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel.
"
"To assess the spread of cancert, X-ray imaging of the chest and abdomen should be done. Computed tomography (CT) images with contrasting agents, meanwhile, is used because the agents enable to veterinarian to examine the area more readily.He or she can then record the location, shape, and size of all masses occurring at the injection sites.
"
"Masses at vaccination sites that persist for longer than three months, are larger than two centimeters in diameter, or increase in size one month after the injection should be biopsied. Advanced lesions should also be biopsied prior to definitive treatment.
"
"
"
"An effective treatment protocol is difficult, but radiation therapy before or after definitive surgery will substantially enhance your dog's survival. Prior to surgery, a contrast CT scan should also be done, because it has been found to result in a substantially longer time until recurrence of the sarcoma. Chemotherapy, meanwhile, has not been found to enhance survival with this form of cancer.
"
"Do not over-vaccinate your dog. Vaccinate for rabies and other diseases no more frequently than every three years, unless it has been specifically been advised by your veterinarian.

"Uterine tumors in dogs are usually benign (non-spreading) and non-cancerous. Uterine tumors are rare occurrences, usually affecting middle-aged to older female dogs that have not been spayed. These tumors arise from the uterine smooth muscle and epithelial tissues -- the tissues that line the internal organs and cavities. Dogs are most affected with leiomyomas, a benign smooth muscle mass of tissue (neoplasm); 85 to 90 percent of uterine tumors are this type. Fortunately, only 10 percent of dogs have the malignant form of leiomyosarcoma.
"
"Although there is often no sign of the disease, dogs with these type of tumors may display:
"
"This type of tumor tends to affect female dogs that have not been spayed.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible conditions that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases.
"
"Thoracic (chest) X-rays will be taken of the chest to check for cancer spread, and X-rays of the abdomen should also be taken to check for a possible abdominal mass. An ultrasound provides even greater visual sensitivity, and may be used to reveal a uterine mass during an abdominal examination. A computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can further detail a mass and enable the most sensitive detection of the cancer’s spread in the body.
"
"If there is abdominal fluid buildup, a fluid sample should be tapped and sent to the laboratory for analysis. A cellular examination of a biopsy taken from the tumor is required for a definitive diagnosis.
"
"
"
"The ideal treatment is to spay the dog. However, doxorubicin, cisplatin, carboplatin, and epirubicin are the most rational chemotherapeutic choices for treating cancerous uterine tumors and their spread of disease. If your dog has a uterine infection, such as pyometra, your doctor will prescribe the appropriate medications for treating the infection. Often, the treatment for pyometra is surgical removal of the uterus, or spaying.
"
"If the uterine tumor is malignant, your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments every three months to check for cancer spread and adjust the therapy as needed.  Before each chemotherapy treatment, complete bloodwork will be done. If the uterine tumor is benign, surgery (spaying) is generally curative. Your veterinarian will schedule health checkups in accordance with your dog's overall health condition, but unless there was an underlying condition, your dog should be able to go about living normally.

"Vaginal tumors are the second most common reproductive tumor in dogs, comprising 2.4–3 percent of all tumors in dogs. In dogs 86 percent of vaginal tumors are benign smooth muscle tumors, often with fingerlike extensions (e.g., leiomyoma, a type of smooth muscle tumor; fibroleiomyoma, a fibrous tissue and smooth muscle tissue tumor; and fibroma, a fibrous tissue tumor). In dogs, a vaginal tumor may never bother the animal (and thus never be diagnosed), or it may cause complications that are not a direct result of the tumor, but a result of its presence in the body, such as with uterine leiomyomatas, which can cause excessive menstrual bleeding. Other complications can include painful urination, and difficult birthings.
"
"Outside the vagina
"
"Inside the vagina (intraluminal)
"
"Female dogs that are unspayed are most commonly affeted with vaginal tumors, especially those that have never given birth.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. A vaginoscopy will be performed. This method uses a tiny instrument that is equipped with a camera for inspecting the inside of the vagina, and which is capable of cutting and gathering tissue for biopsy. The biopsy, along with a cytologic examination of an aspirate taken from the vaginal tissue may help to determine the vaginal tumor’s cell type. An examination of vaginal cells and tissue is necessary for a definitive diagnosis to be made.
"
"Chest X-rays should also be taken to check for spread of the cancer. Abdominal X-rays may show the vaginal tumor, while ultrasonography, vaginography, and urethrocystography may help to visualize a mass. Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will give a clearly outlined image of a  tumor, allowing your doctor to assess for surgical feasibility, and to assess for possible degree of cancerous spread.
"
"
"
"Surgical removal of the vaginal tumor with a concurrent spaying of the patient is the treatment of choice. For sarcomas and mast cell tumors (which are malignant), or for benign tumors which can not be completely removed, post-operative radiotherapy is indicated.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you for your dog's X-rays as frequently as every three months if the tumor was malignant (aggressive and spreading). Bloodwork will be done before each chemotherapy treatment to check on your dog's health status and progress.

"The thymus is an organ in front of the heart in the rib cage in which T lymphocytes mature and multiply.  A thymoma is a tumor originating from the epithelium (layer of tissue covering the thymus) of the thymus.  Thymomas are rare tumors in both cats and dogs and they are associated with myasthenia gravis.  Myasthenia gravis is a severe autoimmune disease which causes certain muscle groups to tire easily.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on the patient. He/she will take a thorough history from the owner. Your veterinarian will order a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel.
"
"Thoracic X-rays should definitely be taken. They may show a cranial mediastinal mass (a mass in between the lungs), pleural effusion (build-up of fluid in the lungs due to aspiration pneumonia) and megaesophagus.
"
"A blood test for antibodies to acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter causing muscles to contract) receptors should be performed so as to rule out myasthenia gravis. A Tensilon test should also be done to test for myasthenia gravis.
"
"A fine-needle aspirate of the mass will show mature lymphocytes (white blood cells) and epithelial cells (cells forming the outside layer of the thymus gland).
"
"
"
"Patients should be hospitalized in preparation for surgery to remove the thymoma. They are highly invasive and difficult to remove in dogs. (They are easier to remove in cats.) Dogs with concurrent myasthenia gravis and aspiration pneumonia will have a poorer prognosis despite surgical resection. Twenty to thirty percent of thymomas are malignant and spread throughout the chest and/or abdomen.
"
"If the tumor is completely surgically resectable (and has not spread), the patient will be cured.  Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments every three months with you to retake thoracic x-rays of your pet in case the tumor should recur.

"Meningioma is the most common brain tumor in dogs. It affects a system of membranes that envelops the brain and spinal cord called the meninges. These tumors compress adjacent tissues and may lead to swelling in the affected regions. All breeds are at risk of meningioma, but it is usually seen in dogs older than seven years of age.
"
"The symptoms vary depending upon the location of tumor, but some of the more common symptoms include:
"
"The underlying cause for meningioma is currently unknown.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal. For further analysis, your dog’s veterinarian will also take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, a protective and nourishing fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord.
"
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computed Tomography scan are the two most valuable tools for identification of lesions and its localization. Although tissue biopsies are also frequently used to diagnose meningioma.
"
"
"
"For definitive treatment, complete surgical excision is required, but this is not always possible. Sometimes tumors are not accessible for surgical removal, and other times incomplete excision occurs due to the invasiveness of the tumor. In these cases, radiation therapy may be recommended. Additionally, fluid therapy, dietary changes, and medications are used to control seizures and stabilize the dog.
"
"Overall prognosis depends on the extent of the excision achieved during surgery. Many dogs that undergo successful surgery for complete excision of tumor mass, for example, have a good prognosis. However, some animals do not recover well due to the invasiveness of the tumor to deeper tissues or other complications.
"
"You will need to take your dog to the veterinarian in regular intervals for follow-up evaluations of the disease and treatment response. After surgery, you should expect your dog to feel sore. To minimize discomfort, your veterinarian will give you pain medication, which should be used with extreme caution (one of the most preventable accidents with pets is an overdose of medication). You will need to limit your dog's activity while it heals, setting aside a quiet place for it to rest away from household activity, children, and other pets. You might consider cage rest for your dog to limit its physical activity.

"Heartworms (Dirofilaria immitis) are parasitic roundworms that can infect both dogs and cats. If your pets are not on pet prescription heartworm prevention program, they may contract the parasite through the bite of an infected mosquito. Heartworm disease is preventable if you diligently use heartworm prevention prescribed by your veterinarian.
"
"Dogs are “natural” hosts to heartworms, meaning that once they become infected, the juvenile heartworm parasites can complete their entire life cycle. As the heartworms mature, they work their way into your dog’s heart, lungs and associated blood vessels. Once there, they can grow to be up to a foot long. It is possible for one dog to be infected with hundreds of heartworms.
"
"If not treated properly, heartworms in dogs will lead to serious health complications and death. This is why it is so important to keep your dog on continuous heartworm prevention.
"
" 
"
"
"
"If your dog has been diagnosed with heartworm disease via a heartworm antigen test (the most common form of testing), your veterinarian will do a few more diagnostic tests to confirm diagnosis.
"
"A test for microfilariae (juvenile heartworms in the blood stream) will be performed. If no microfilariae are found, a confirmatory test for adult heartworms should be run by sending a sample to an outside lab.
"
"Complete blood cell count, blood chemistry tests, a urinalysis and chest X-rays to assess your dog’s overall condition and plan the safest way to move forward with treatment. An echocardiogram is recommended for moderate to severe cases.
"
"Other tests may also be necessary based on a dog’s individual case.
"
"Medications: Protocols for treating heartworms often call for the use of multiple medications including several injections to kill the adult heartworms, doxycycline and prednisone taken orally to reduce the chances of unwanted side effects, and heartworm preventative to kill the juvenile heartworms and prevent further infection. In some cases, other medications may be prescribed or different protocols recommended.
"
"Surgery: Severe cases of heartworms in dogs may require surgery to remove the worms from the heart and vessels within the lungs, but many of these patients die regardless of treatment.
"
"Exercise Restriction: Exercise restriction is a vital part of successful treatment for heartworms in dogs. This is required before, during and after treatment for a prolonged period of time.
"
"Treatment protocols for heartworms are determined on a case-by-case basis, but most dogs are treated with some variation of the following, taking place over the course of several months:
"
"Begin exercise restriction.
"
"If the dog’s condition is especially severe, appropriate stabilization therapy is necessary.
"
"Begin treatment with oral prednisone and doxycycline to reduce the chances of a bad reaction to the death of heartworms.
"
"Hospitalize the dog for the day and give a heartworm preventative to kill juvenile heartworms in the bloodstream. This is often given in the clinic in case of a reaction. Continue to give heartworm preventatives monthly at home.
"
"Give the first injection of melarsomine to kill adult heartworms 30 days after the end of the doxycycline treatment. Restrict exercise and closely monitor for side effects for the next 30 days.
"
"Give the second injection of melarsomine 30 days after the first.
"
"Give the third injection of melarsomine one day after the second.
"
"Continue exercise restriction for another six to eight weeks.
"
"Test for microfilariae (juvenile heartworms in the blood stream) 30 days after third melarsomine injection.
"
"Test for adult heartworms and microfilariae approximately 9 months after the third melarsomine injection.
"
"The most important aspect of home care for dogs undergoing treatment for heartworms is exercise restriction. Dogs should be crated when a responsible adult is not able to prevent excess activity.
"
"Dogs should only be allowed outside for short on-leash walks to urinate and defecate. Give your dog the full course of any prescription pet medications that have been prescribed, even if he or she appears to be healthy.
"
"As with any type of laboratory test, false positive and false negative results on heartworm tests are possible. In particular, dogs who have been bitten by a heartworm-infected mosquito within the last six months will test negative until their heartworms mature. Retesting at an appropriate date will usually reveal that the dog does have heartworms.
"
"If you have any doubts as to your dog’s diagnosis, you can ask that your dog be tested for heartworm disease at a later date or using a different type of test.
"
"Dogs who have had heartworms are not immune to reinfection. Ask your veterinarian what schedule of testing and preventative administration is required to avoid future heartworm infections. Most dogs benefit from receiving year-round heartworm prevention.
"
"Side effects are common with heartworm treatment. Many dogs experience soreness and swelling at the site of melarsomine injections (the muscles on either side of the spine). Abscesses can also form in these locations.
"
"Talk to your veterinarian if your dog is very uncomfortable or becomes worse over time.
"
"The most severe problems that are seen after heartworm treatment in dogs are related to the sudden death of large numbers of worms. Call your veterinarian immediately if you notice any of the following:
"
"Your dog develops a cough or a preexisting cough becomes worse
"
"Your dog has difficulty breathing or pants excessively
"
"Your dog becomes weak or lethargic or collapses
"
"Your dog’s appetite significantly decreases
"
"Your dog begins to vomit or drool excessively or develops diarrhea
"
"While the treatment of heartworms in dogs can cause serious side effects, heartworms kill dogs if left untreated.
"
"Prevention, on the other hand, is easy and well-tolerated by most dogs. By preventing heartworms in the first place, you can save your dog from a long and difficult treatment process.

"Tumors can arise anywhere on a dog’s body, and the paws are no exception. Checking a dog’s paws to ensure they don’t have any new masses is an important part of a routine veterinary exam.
"
"Tumors on a dog’s paw typically appear as mass-like growths. They can develop anywhere on the paw, including between the toes, on the paw pads, and at the nail bed.
"
"A variety of tumor types affect dog paws, which means the tumors can have different appearances.
"
"Some paw masses are black, such as a melanoma at the base of a nail bed. Others, like mast cell tumors, can be red or pink, potentially with a raw surface, while some look like warts. Any new growth on your dog’s foot should be examined by a veterinarian.
"
"Common tumors that develop on dogs’ toes or feet and may be cancerous include:
"
"Melanomas
"
"Squamous cell carcinomas
"
"Soft tissue sarcomas
"
"Mast cell tumors
"
"Plasma cell tumors
"
"Cancerous tumors are likely to spread to other parts of the body such as the lymph nodes, lungs, or other organs.
"
"However, not all tumors that develop on a dog’s paw fit this category. Your veterinarian will likely collect a sample of cells to examine under the microscope. They may also recommend taking a sample of the mass and sending it to a laboratory for examination by a pathologist.
"
"A growth on your canine companion’s paw may be uncomfortable for them. Some may develop wounds or cause itching, which may lead to a secondary infection.
"
"A growth on your dog’s foot is not an emergency, but you should contact your veterinarian promptly for an appointment. As with all tumors, earlier intervention usually leads to a better outcome than a wait-and-see approach. Your veterinarian is best suited to let you know if the mass can be monitored or needs treatment.
"
"If your veterinarian has recommended that you monitor the mass at home, you should let them know if the mass changes size or color, or if any sores develop.
"
"Symptoms of a tumor on your dog’s paw include:
"
"A visible growth anywhere on the paw
"
"Limping
"
"Excessively licking the foot
"
"Bleeding or sores on the foot
"
"Changes to the appearance of a nail, including a nail that splits or falls off
"
"Most of the time, your veterinarian won’t be able to tell you exactly why your dog developed a tumor on their paw.
"
"Some tumors are assumed to have a genetic component. For example, dogs with black skin may be predisposed to developing melanomas.
"
"Breeds that may be predisposed to melanoma development include:
"
"Chow Chows
"
"Doberman Pinschers
"
"Golden Retrievers
"
"Breeds that are predisposed to mast cell tumors include:
"
"Boxers
"
"Boston Terriers
"
"Golden Retrievers
"
"Staffordshire Terriers
"
"UV exposure is a known contributor to the development of melanoma in people. Veterinarians assume UV light may play a role in the development of some melanomas in dogs, but the link isn’t as well-established. Dogs also commonly develop melanomas in their mouths, which are unlikely to be caused by sunlight exposure.
"
"Your veterinarian will examine your dog’s paw to determine the next steps. In some cases, they may collect tumor cells with a needle and syringe and examine them under a microscope.
"
"In other cases, your veterinarian may send a sample to an outside lab to find out what kind of tumor your dog has. Paws can be quite sensitive, so your dog may need sedation for this procedure.
"
"Foot X-rays may be performed to see if the nail structure or underlying bone is affected. Your veterinarian may also recommend taking a sample of your dog’s lymph nodes to check for cancer cells if they suspect the tumor is malignant (i.e., cancerous).
"
"Other tests performed in-house may include chest X-rays or an abdominal ultrasound to check for cancer spread, or metastasis.
"
"In some cases, your veterinarian may recommend more advanced imaging—such as a CT scan—to fully evaluate the extent of the tumor and plan for surgical removal. Most veterinarians do not have a CT unit and will need to refer your dog to a specialty clinic for this test.
"
"Treatment for your dog’s foot tumor will focus on managing the primary tumor, as well as treating any spread of the cancer.
"
"A tumor on a dog’s paw can be difficult to remove surgically because there isn’t much extra skin to close the surgical incision.
"
"Leg amputation may be recommended for extensive tumors. If only one toe is affected, amputation of the toe may be the treatment of choice. In either case, your veterinarian will recommend sending the tumor to a reference laboratory for evaluation.
"
"The reference lab will determine the tumor type, how aggressive the tumor is, whether there is evidence of spread, and if the entire tumor was removed.
"
"If the tumor is not completely removed, meaning microscopic cells were left behind, your dog may have recurrence of the tumor. Surgery to remove a paw tumor usually takes one to two hours, but may take longer if amputation or reconstruction is necessary. Surgery costs can vary from a few hundred dollars for a small mass removal, to more than a thousand dollars for larger tumors or if limb amputation is needed.
"
"Chemotherapy is recommended for tumors that have spread to other areas of the body or that have a high potential to spread. Chemotherapy can be quite expensive, ranging from $5,000 to more than $11,000, depending on the protocol and how well your dog responds to treatment.
"
"Radiation therapy may be an option for some tumors. This treatment requires traveling to a specialized facility, and your dog must be sedated for each radiation session.
"
"For some mast cell tumors, the injectable medication Stelfonta® may be a treatment option. This treatment works only for tumors under a certain size and has several other restrictions. However, it’s an option to discuss with your veterinarian if your dog’s paw mass turns out to be a mast cell tumor.
"
"Pet parents who cannot afford surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation can still keep their pets comfortable. Therapy may include pain medications like carprofen or gabapentin. In some cases, a soft bootie may prevent injury to the mass.
"
"Recovery from most surgical procedures takes around two weeks. Your dog is likely to wear a recovery cone during this time. If your veterinarian has prescribed any antibiotics or pain medications, ensure you give them according to their instructions.
"
"If your dog receives chemotherapy, they will require frequent blood work during treatment. Chemotherapy decreases a dog’s white blood cell count, making it difficult for them to fight infections. Alert your veterinarian to any negative side effects your dog experiences.
"
"Survival time depends on the tumor’s type and severity. This study indicates that most dogs who are diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma and undergo toe amputation are still alive one year later, while others say 50% to 83% will survive the first year. The survival rate is lower in the second year.
"
"Another study indicated that survival time for squamous cell carcinoma was 50% at one year and 18% two years after diagnosis and treatment. The same study found that malignant melanoma had a one-year survival rate of 44% and a two-year survival rate of 11%.
"
"Most tumors on dog paws are not preventable. Early intervention can provide a better chance for a good outcome, so ensure you check your dog’s paws regularly for any growths or changes.
"
"Lumps on your dog’s paws can have a variety of causes, including cysts and tumors. Any lumps that arise on your dog’s paws should be evaluated by a veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"Mast cell tumors have a tendency to develop open sores, which can be uncomfortable for the dog. As malignant tumors, they also have the potential to spread to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, or liver.
"
"Mast cell cancer can be fatal, so any mast cell tumors should be surgically removed as soon as possible.
"
"Some tumors are prone to developing sores that bleed, while others may bleed if your dog licks or chews the mass. Tumors may also bleed if they get bumped or scraped, which can easily happen to paw tumors.
"
"Yes, some tumors that grow on dog paws are benign. However, any growth on a dog’s paw should be investigated by a veterinarian to determine whether it is cancerous or benign.
"
"A pink growth on your dog’s paw should be investigated by a veterinarian. The growth could be a cyst or a sign of infection. However, pink growths can also be tumors.

"TVT is a transmissible cancer in dogs that’s usually spread via direct contact with the tumor during mating. The likelihood of this tumor varies dramatically based on geographic location. For example, while rare in most of the continental United States, in other countries such as India there can be a high prevalence of TVT among stray dogs.
"
"Dogs with this tumor develop painful masses that protrude from the vulva or penis. Sometimes this tumor can be found on the nose, mouth, eyes, or skin if the dog sniffs or licks the tumor of another dog.
"
"While it’s normal to be alarmed when you notice a new growth on your dog, TVT typically warrants making a veterinary appointment rather than visiting an emergency clinic. However, if your dog is in pain or can’t stop licking at the tumor, you may consider urgent care to get relief immediately.  
"
"TVT can be found worldwide but is most common in tropical and subtropical urban environments. It is one of just three known transmissible cancers. The other two are Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease and leukemia in many marine bivalves, including clams, mussels, and oysters.
"
"Tumors on the genitals may have the following signs:
"
"Gray or pinkish-gray color
"
"Bleed easily when touched
"
"Cauliflower-like “stalk” appearance
"
"Firm but easily friable texture (it may bleed or tear easily)
"
"Bleeding from the genitals
"
"Licking at genitals
"
"Swelling of genitals
"
"When tumors are on the mouth or nose, in addition to the nodular masses, you may also notice:
"
"Bleeding from the nose (epistaxis)
"
"Sneezing
"
"Bad breath
"
"Excessive drooling
"
"Loss of teeth
"
"Sores on the gums or palate
"
"On the skin, these nodules often develop open sores, and nearby lymph nodes might become enlarged.
"
"Transmissible venereal tumor in dogs is usually spread during mating. While it’s common to see the masses on the external genitals, it can also affect the internal genitals. The cancer passes between animals more easily if there are abrasions in the mucosal surface of the genitals.
"
"TVT can also develop in other parts of the body through social behaviors like licking or sniffing another dog’s tumor.
"
"Currently, it’s not known what cell type TVT originates from. Interestingly, TVT cancer cells have fewer chromosomes (around 59) compared to a dog’s normal cells, which have 78 chromosomes. It’s suspected that the disease first developed thousands of years ago in wolves or wild dogs.
"
"No breeds are predisposed. Young, sexually active (not neutered or spayed), stray dogs are more likely to be affected. TVT affects both sexes, though females reportedly have a higher likelihood.
"
"The tumor is usually suspected based on the animal’s history, location on the body, and appearance of the mass.
"
"Your vet will want a diagnostic sample by pressing a slide to the tumor or placing a needle into the tumor to aspirate some cells, then examining the cells under a microscope.
"
"A diagnosis is made by sending a small sample of the tumor to a reference laboratory for examination under a microscope. Taking a biopsy sample requires sedation and is usually a minor surgical procedure. At the reference laboratory, a staining procedure called immunohistochemistry may be performed on tumor samples to determine how aggressive the tumor is.
"
"With TVT, metastasis (spread to other parts of the body) doesn’t usually occur. In cases where it’s suspected, the veterinarian may take samples of the lymph nodes, recommend X-rays of the chest, and recommend an ultrasound of the abdomen.
"
"Surgical removal of the mass is an option if the mass is small (less than 2 centimeters in diameter) and in an accessible location. Surgery isn’t usually an option for tumors that are large, affecting the internal genitals, and/or affecting other areas like the inside of the nose.
"
"For single tumors, injecting the chemotherapy medication vincristine into the tumor for one to four treatments, as well as interleukin-2 (a compound that mediates interactions between white blood cells), is usually quite effective. One treatment cycle is often sufficient.
"
"If the dog has evidence of metastatic TVT (where the tumor has spread to other parts of the body) or has multiple tumors, the treatment of choice is intravenous vincristine chemotherapy given once weekly for up to six weeks. Your dog will need to be monitored to ensure they are tolerating chemotherapy, which can affect their immune system by decreasing white blood cell counts.
"
"While radiation therapy can be highly effective, it’s restricted to specialized facilities. In some cases, one radiation session can treat the tumor.
"
"In the rare cases where spontaneous regression (a decrease in size of the tumor) does occur, it usually begins within three months of transmission. If the dog has had the tumor for nine months with no evidence of regression, it is unlikely to happen at all.  Most TVTs require intervention, so pet parents of dogs with TVT should follow their veterinarian’s recommendations as soon as possible.
"
"With recommended treatment, the prognosis for TVT is good in otherwise healthy dogs, regardless of where the tumor is located or whether it has metastasized. Rarely, highly aggressive tumors can be fatal, especially when untreated.
"
"Pet parents should be aware that their dog can get TVT again after the initial TVT was cured. To reduce the likelihood of spreading this tumor, pet parents must prevent contact between their pets and stray dogs. Spaying and neutering also decreases the risk of cancer spreading between dogs.
"
"If your dog has TVT, do not allow them to have contact with other dogs until the veterinarian confirms that the disease has been cured.
"
"Without surgery or medical intervention, most dogs will continue to have the tumor. These tumors may become resistant to treatment and your dog could spread the tumor to other dogs. 
"
" These tumors are uncomfortable for your canine companion. The masses often develop sores and bleed, and your pet may want to lick them. Some pets may need anti-inflammatory medications like carprofen to help decrease pain and inflammation.
"
"Others may need an Elizabethan collar (e-collar or cone) to keep them away from the area. The tumor may also predispose your dog to a urinary tract infection. Speak with your veterinarian if your pet seems bothered by their TVT.
"
"Yes, TVT can be cured. Surgery is an option for accessible small tumors that haven’t spread. Other TVTs are often cured with just one chemotherapy or radiation treatment, though multiple treatment sessions may be necessary.
"
"No, TVT does not spread to humans. However, you should wear gloves if you touch the tumor.
"
"Most dogs with TVT who get treated early in the course of disease will live a normal lifespan. Dogs that have their tumor for over a year may become more resistant to treatment and quality of life may become limited, possibly necessitating humane euthanasia.

"Toxoplasmosis infection is caused by a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). It is one of the most common parasitic diseases, and is known to affect nearly all warm-blooded animals and humans.
"
"Cats are recognized as the primary host, as the parasite completes its life cycle in the cat's intestinal tract, passing back into the environment through the feces. However, cats are not the only source of infection.
"
"In the U.S., the main source for T. gondii transmission is raw meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables. Both acute and chronic forms of toxoplasmosis exist, where the chronic form is usually a low-grade disease without any clinical symptoms, and the acute form is more symptomatic.
"
"Cats are more commonly seen with clinical symptoms than dogs. Still, dogs can be made ill from this parasite, and may mimic other infections, such as canine distemper or rabies. At increased risk are young dogs with developing immune systems, and dogs that have impaired immunity. The following symptoms are known to occur in infected cats, and may also be seen in dogs:
"
"Dogs become infected through contact with the T. gondii parasite, which may be acquired from rooting in infected soil or from ingesting cat feces.
"
"A tooth root abscess is a pocket of infection around the root of a tooth under the gumline.  Abscessed teeth are painful and may cause a dog to stop eating or to not want to chew on toys.  In some cases, swelling can appear below the eye or along the jaw. 
"
"Due to the pain and infection, a tooth root abscess can be a medical emergency.  If you suspect your pet may have a tooth root abscess, you should take them to the veterinarian immediately.  In most cases, surgery will be needed to remove the tooth.  However, even if that cannot be done immediately, the pet should be seen as soon as possible to start treatment, likely with pain medication and antibiotics, until the procedure can be scheduled. 
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Not all dogs with a tooth root abscess will show clinical signs, but when they do some common ones are:
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Bad breath (halitosis)
"
"The uvea is the part of the eye that is made up of the iris (the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil), the ciliary body (which produces the fluid within the eye [aqueous humour] and controls the ciliary muscle contractions that aid in near focus), the choroid (which provides oxygen and nourishment to the retina – the inner surface of the eye), and the pars plana (at the front of the eye, where the iris and sclera [white of the eye] touch). A melanoma is clinically characterized by malignant growth of melanocytes, cells that are dark in appearance due to the inclusion of the melanin pigment.
"
"Uveal melanomas usually arise from the front of the iris’ surface, with extension to the ciliary body and choroid. These tumors tend to be flat and diffuse, not nodular (unlike intraocular melanomas, which are raised masses). Such tumors initially have a benign (non-spreading) clinical and cellular appearance. Uveal melanomas are the most common primary intraocular neoplasm in dogs. They are usually benign and unilateral, affecting the anterior uvea most often. However, uveal melanomas are just as often capable of destroying the eye. Anterior uveal melanomas have a four percent rate of cancerous spread through the bloodstream to the lungs and visceral organs. Choroidal melanomas rarely metastasize.
"
"Anterior Uveal Melanoma
"
"Choroidal Melanomas
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, including a complete ophthalmic exam (including testing pressure within the eye and proper drainage of the eye’s aqueous humor). A complete blood profile will also be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Evidence of metastasis may may be present in the blood profile, or the blood count may show increased white blood cells, which can be indicative of the body's immune system fighting the malignant cell growth. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms.
"
"X-rays and an ultrasound may also help to determine the extent of metastatic disease in the eye. During the ophthalmic exam, tonometry will be used to measure the pressure in the eyes, and gonioscopy will be used to see if the melanoma has spread to the drainage angle. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy can be used to gage the size and location of the mass. The mass should be transilluminated, a technique which uses strong light to shine through the eyeball, illuminating it throughout as an aid to diagnosis. Indirect ophthalmoscopy can also be used to investigate the eye, with or without concomitant scleral indentation.
"
"
"
"Uveal melanomas in dogs are usually non-spreading tumors (benign), so you may opt to monitor the eye for changes every 3–6 months. Young Labrador retrievers are prone to aggressively growing uveal melanomas and will need surgery. Removal of the affected eye (enucleation) is the suggested treatment.
"
"Indications for enucleation: the size of the mass increases rapidly, the eye cannot be salvaged, the mass spreads diffusely within the eye, visual function is significantly impaired, invasion of the tumor outside the eye, and secondary complications (e.g., glaucoma, signs of pain, bleeding).
"
"Removing an eye is one-sided, and is done to spare the fellow eye. One-eyed animals often function very well, adjusting to the change in visual capacity quickly. If your dog develops glaucoma secondary to an uveal melanoma, your dog will very likely suffer a good deal of great pain. The resulting headaches may manifest as head shaking, head pressing, whining, placing the paws on the head, or lethargy and slow movements.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for X-ray and ultrasound imaging at six and twelve months following the initial surgery or treatment. At these appointments, your veterinarian will evaluate the enucleation site as well as check for tumor recurrence or metastasis.

"You will need to give a detailed history of your dog's health, onset and nature of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition, such as contact with cat feces, or prevalence of feral cats in the yard space. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate your dog's body systems and to evaluate the overall health of your dog. Routine laboratory tests -- such as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- are also used to confirm infection.
"
"For example, dogs with toxoplasmosis may show an abnormally low number of white blood cells (leukopenia), low neutrophils (neutropenia), and low lymphocytes (lymphopenia) in the complete blood count.
"
"Conversely, during recovery, the complete blood count may reveal an increased number of white blood cells, an indication of the increased activity of the infection fighting white blood cells.
"
"The biochemistry profile usually reveals abnormally high levels liver enzymes ALT (alanine aminotransferase ) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase). Moreover, the level of albumin (the protein normally present in the blood) is also found to be at decreased levels in some dogs with toxoplasmosis; a medical condition known as hypoalbuminemia. In some rare cases, jaundice is seen with disturbed liver enzymes ALT and AST. The urinalysis may reveal abnormally high level of proteins and bilirubin in the urine sample.
"
"Serological tests are the most reliable tests for making a definitive diagnosis. By measuring the levels of toxoplasma antigens in the body, your veterinarian can determine the type of infection, and whether it is active, dormant, recent (acute), or long term (chronic).
"
"Serological tests will also help in determining the levels of antibodies IgM and IgG. Antibodies are proteins that are normally present in the body or produced in response to an antigen (in this case toxoplasma) for the purpose of neutralizing the antigen. Determination of antigen and antibody levels will help your veterinarian make the confirmatory diagnosis. The polymerase chain reaction test is a reliable test for verifying the presence of Toxoplasma gondii in samples.
"
"More advanced diagnostic testing includes taking a collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Laboratory testing of CSF may reveal an abnormally high number of white blood cells (WBCs) and protein concentrations in patients with infection that has reached the central nervous system.
"
"
"
"In case of severe disease, your dog may need to be hospitalized for emergency treatment. This is rarely the case with dogs, and is more likely only with dogs that have suppressed immune systems. Fluids can be given intravenously to dogs with poor hydration. Antibiotics may also be given to control the infection and prevent further progression of disease symptoms.
"
"While cats are the best known transmitters for the T. gondii parasite, it is important to remember that the parasite is more frequently acquired through handling raw meat and eating unwashed fruits and vegetables. The best protection against this parasite, for you and your pet, is through prevention and hygiene. Do not feed raw meat to your dog, and do not allow your dog to have access to cat feces. That is, if you also have a cat in the home, keep the litter box in a location where the dog cannot gain access to it, as dogs are known to eat cat feces.
"
"Other protective measures include covering outdoor sandboxes when not in use to prevent cats from using them as litter boxes, wearing gloves while gardening, washing hands after playing outside (particularly with children), wearing disposable gloves while changing litter boxes (and possibly a face mask as well, if pregnant or immune compromised), and keeping the litter box clean on a daily basis. The longer the infected feces remains in the litter box, the more likely the possibility that the eggs of the parasite will become viable and infectious. If at all possible, pregnant women should avoid cleaning litter boxes, as this parasite has been known to cause severe complications during pregnancy. If it is unavoidable, make sure that all precautions are taken to avoid contact through the respiratory tract (face mask, disposable gloves).
"
"If you do also have a cat in your home, you may choose to have your cat tested for the T. gondii parasite, but the irony is that cats that test positive are less likely to be a threat of infectious transmission than cats that test negative, since cats that test positive are only testing positive for the antibodies to the parasite, meaning that they have already been previously infected and are now nearly immune to the infection; therefore, posing a much lower risk of being infectious. In fact, cats that have been infected with the T. gondii are generally immune to repeat infections for up to six years.
"
"Conversely, if your cat tests negative for T. gondii antibodies, you will need to be that much more preventative in your approach to protecting your cat from infection, since they have no immunity to protect them from infection.
"
"You can also have your dog tested for T. gondii antibodies, but the same rule applies generally. If your dog has antibodies in its bloodstream, then it has already been infected. Dogs are not regarded as a threat for transmission of this parasite.

"
"Tooth root abscesses are an infection at the tip of the tooth root.  The infection often occurs as a result of bacteria entering a chip, crack, or fracture in the tooth and traveling down the tooth, causing swelling and inflammation at the tip of the root. 
"
"Another way the infection can occur is through the gums themselves in cases of severe dental disease.  Inflammation of the gum starts out as gingivitis but can progress to severe inflammation and infection (periodontal disease) with large tartar buildup that houses bacteria.  This causes bad breath and can also lead to bacteria surrounding the root and resulting in a tooth root abscess. 
"
"Any tooth is susceptible to tooth root abscess, but the most commonly fractured teeth, and therefore most common teeth to have tooth root abscesses, are the carnassial teeth.  There are four carnassial teeth in a dog’s mouth.  They are the fourth upper premolars (large premolars on both sides of the top jaw) and the lower first molars (largest molars on both sides of the bottom jaw). 
"
"Any dog can get a tooth root abscess, but enthusiastic chewing dogs may be at higher risk.  A common type of tooth fracture, called a slab fracture, can occur when a dog bites down on a hard object at a slightly oblique angle, causing a chip to break off.  This type of broken tooth is common in carnassial teeth and can be a source of tooth root abscesses.  
"
"Your veterinarian will collect a thorough history to determine if your dog is having any trouble eating or chewing.  Next, they will perform a detailed physical examination to assess for evidence of facial swelling or draining wounds, fractured or discolored teeth, or fever.  Based on your pet’s history and a physical examination, your vet may suspect a tooth root abscess, but dental x-rays are needed for a  diagnosis. 
"
"Dental x-rays must be performed under general anesthesia and are usually performed at the same time as a dental cleaning, called a prophylaxis.  A tooth root abscess will show up on the dental x-ray as a dark area in the bone around the affected root.  Before anesthesia, a complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will all likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation. 
"
"Many times, when dogs present for suspected tooth root abscess, it is not possible for them to have anesthesia for further evaluation and treatment. That’s because the veterinarian needs to schedule an appropriate time for such a procedure and ensure that the pet has not eaten since the night before any anesthesia.  Because of this delay, dogs may be started on pain medications, anti-inflammatory medications, and antibiotics. 
"
"While the clinical signs of a tooth root abscess, such as facial swelling or pain when eating, may improve with medical management, it is important to remember that antibiotics will not eliminate the abscess.  These are pockets of pus that cause tooth decay and kill tissue.  Even with antibiotic therapy, the bacteria will remain trapped in the root and inside the tooth where antibiotics cannot penetrate.  So even though your dog may appear to improve, without further care, the swelling, pain, and other clinical signs will likely return after you finish the antibiotics. 
"
"The only two treatment options for a tooth root abscess are root canal and extraction.  A root canal can preserve the structure of the tooth while removing the infection by hollowing out the internal structure of the tooth that would otherwise retain the infection.  There are many criteria to determine if a dog is a suitable candidate for a root canal, including damage or trauma to the tooth and surrounding teeth, degree of periodontal disease, and health of your dog's jaw bones. If you are interested in root canal, your veterinarian will likely refer you to a dental specialist for further assessment. 
"
"The more common treatment option is extraction or removal of the affected tooth.  This can be performed by most general practice veterinarians and may involve a nerve block and post-extraction x-ray to confirm that the entire tooth was removed.  Sometimes a gingival flap is made and sutured in place with oral stitches, which are typically left to dissolve on their own and do not need to be removed.  Dogs are typically discharged the same day with antibiotics, pain medications, and anti-inflammatory medication.
"
"The cost for extraction of teeth in dogs can vary depending on many factors including geographic location, type of tooth, and how extensive the procedure is.  However, according to CareCredit, pet owners can expect to pay anywhere between $800 and $3,000 for a dental cleaning and extractions. 
"
"After evaluation of your dog, your veterinarian is the best resource for the appropriate diagnostic and treatment plan for your pet and the associated costs.  Ask your vet for a detailed estimate of your specific pet’s needs.
"
"An early diagnosis and treatment of tooth root abscesses is important for good outcomes and to minimize complications such as spread of infection to the jawbone, soft tissues of the face and neck, and in rare cases to the heart (endocarditis) or brain (bacterial meningitis). Ifyou suspect that your pet has a tooth root abscess, have them evaluated by a veterinarian as soon as possible. 
"
"Most dogs will be discharged the same day as their anesthetic procedure for dental cleaning and extraction. They may be sleepy for the rest of the day, but will likely be back to their normal selves by the next day.  Typically, they will need to eat a canned or softened diet for 5-7 days after discharge. Kibble can be softened by adding warm water and allowing it to soak for 5 minutes prior to feeding it to the dog. Additionally, no hard treats or toys should be given to the dog for a week so the gums can heal. 
"
"With appropriate care, most dogs with a tooth root abscess make a complete recovery and go back to their normal lives. Remember to follow all discharge instructions from your veterinarian regarding your pet’s care. 
"
"The best way to prevent tooth root abscesses is to practice proactive dental healthcare. The mainstay of dental care in veterinary medicine is prophylactic dental cleanings, which are typically recommended every 12 months to maintain your dog’s teeth and oral health. Speak to your veterinarian about scheduling one of these cleanings. 
"
"Toothbrushing is another helpful way to keep your dog’s teeth healthy. To be considered effective, it is recommended that you brush your pet’s teeth at home at least two to three times a week, in addition to their annual dental cleaning with their veterinarian. 
"
"Additionally, the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) is a group of veterinary dentists and scientists that help set standards in the care of dog’s and cat’s teeth.  They have compiled a helpful list of approved dog products including treats, chews, and kibble that are designed to reduce tartar accumulation and help keep your pet’s breath fresh and clean.

"Tooth fractures refer to tooth injuries involving damage to the enamel, dentin and cement. These injuries occur either on the enamel-covered top portion of the tooth (the crown) or the part below the gum line (the root).
"
"Both dogs and cats are susceptible to traumatic tooth injuries. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"The most common complication involving a tooth fracture is inflammation and infection. In some instances, the tooth's crown may be missing; blood or pink tissue may also be present on or around the affected area. Otherwise, dogs with root fractures display constant discomfort and pain.
"
"The most common cause of a tooth fracture is a traumatic event or injury. A tooth may be broken, for instance, by chewing on a hard object, a blunt force trauma to the face, or a minor automobile collision.
"
"To review the full extent of the tooth fracture, your veterinarian will take X-rays of the dog's mouth. A full oral examination will be completed, as well, to review the overall oral health of your dog.
"
"
"
"The treatment will depend on the extent and severity of dog's trauma. Crowns and other additive dental work can be applied to repair the damaged tooth, including the use of surgery when the damage is severe. Extraction may be recommended if the tooth or root cannot be repaired, followed by a sealing of the affected area with a restorative material or lining.
"
"In many cases, restricting the dog's activities is recommended until it is fully recovered. During this time, the dog's diet should mainly consist of moist food items.
"
"It is important to monitor your dog's progress following treatment, and to continue with regular tooth care and cleaning. Any damage or irritation to the gums can be detected during routine brushing or cleaning of the teeth.
"
"The most common complications are infection or the need for a follow-up root canal.
"
"Prevent your dog from chewing on extremely hard substances, such as rocks, as this can damage the structure of the tooth or cause tooth breakage. Also, dogs that are allowed to roam freely are at a higher risk than those who are in a contained, safe environment.

"A dog’s knee, also referred to as a stifle, is a complex structure consisting of:
"
"While there are multiple ligaments within the knee, typically a torn knee ligament refers to the tearing of the cranial cruciate ligament. The cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) is the equivalent of the human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). This ligament helps stabilize the knee in dogs by keeping the tibia from sliding too far in front of the femur. A CrCL rupture is a snapping of this ligament which decreases the stability of the knee.
"
"The degree of lameness noted can vary with the type of damage to the ligament (partial or full tear) and can compound or worsen over time as the disease of the ligament and other internal knee structures progresses. Around 50% of animals that develop a torn ligament and rupture in one knee will develop it in the other knee at some time in the future.
"

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Hind-leg lameness is the most obvious symptom of a torn knee ligament. Severity may vary from intermittent lameness after activity to an inability to bear weight on the affected leg. When sudden incidents of full or partial tears occur, you may also notice swelling or pain when touching or manipulating your dog’s knee.
"
"There are two potential causes of a torn knee ligament in dogs.
"
"Over time, the CrCL develops damage due to wear and tear from physical activity and stress on the knee. This wear and tear is referred to as cranial cruciate ligament disease. Typically, cranial cruciate ligament disease (CrCLD) occurs over a period of months to years.
"
"Cranial Cruciate Ligament Disease occurs due to many pre-existing conditions or compounding medical issues throughout the animal’s life, including:
"
"As this damage/wear and tear accumulates, eventually the cranial cruciate ligament will rupture during use. Typically, this accumulation of damage to the cranial cruciate ligament is what leads to the tearing of the ligament. The second potential cause is a sudden traumatic rupture of the CrCL. This occurs due to a trauma (being struck by a vehicle) or an athletic situation (playing rough at a dog park) in young, healthy dogs whose ligaments have not incurred any prior damage. Sudden traumatic rupture is not typically common.
"
"Veterinarians diagnose a fully torn CrCL by noting cranial drawer. Cranial drawer is instability in the knee that occurs when the knee is manipulated by the veterinarian and is present only when the CrCL is completely torn.
"
"To detect cranial drawer the veterinarian will grasp the thigh bone and shin bone and try to pull the shin bone in front of the thigh bone. An intact CrCL will prevent the shin bone from going past the thigh bone. The cranial drawer test helps to determine if there are any “clicks” between the muscle and joint. Proper radiographs and evaluation for cranial drawer may require sedation due to the strength of the muscles around the knee and compliance of the pet to restraint.
"
"Absence of cranial drawer indicates that there is not a full tear to the CrCL. The veterinarian will also do the following:
"
"Typically, radiographs (X-rays) are required to evaluate the internal structures of the knee to assess for the presence and severity of joint effusion or arthritis, and for surgical planning, if needed.
"
"There are currently three options for surgical correction of a torn knee ligament in dogs:
"
"Physical therapy and Necessary Follow-up Treatment
"
"Discussion with your veterinarian/surgeon will help determine which procedure is best for your pet. Multiple variables, such as size, activity level, knee stability, age, and finances are used to decide which procedure is the most beneficial.
"
"Lameness is usually present for up to a month after surgery but improves over time. A three-  to four-month period of strict cage rest is typically required for proper healing after the surgery. Strict cage rest refers to the pet being always confined to a small room/kennel - except for short leash walks for the bathroom, laying with family members or eating.  All unconfined activity should only be allowed under strict observation by a family member to prevent the pet from overusing the affected knee. Increased or excessive activity prior to healing can result in surgical complications and failure of the procedure performed.
"
"It also is important to avoid slippery surfaces and sudden large changes in elevation (such as stairs and getting on and off furniture). After the initial rest period, a slow progressive workload of the limb is recommended, with expected full recovery and limb use after six months.
"
"Typical costs of surgical correction for a CrCL rupture varies greatly depending on the size of the animal, location in the country and type of procedure performed. The average cost for one of these surgical procedures can range from $2,000 to $5,000.
"
"A dog can live with a torn ligament, but arthritis and lameness in the knee and hind leg will progress without surgical correction.
"
"A partially torn CrCL will not heal on its own due to a poor blood supply to the ligament.

"The outer coating of the tooth, the enamel, develops according to a specific set of physical and environmental circumstances. Normally developed enamel will have a smooth, white appearance. However, when conditions in the environment interfere with the development of tooth enamel, teeth can  take on a discolored, pitted or otherwise unusual appearance.
"
"Bodily influences, like canine distemper virus (in young puppies that are not vaccinated) or a fever over an extended period of time, may cause pitting and discolored enamel surfaces. Local influences, like injury (even from baby tooth extraction) over a short period of time can cause specific patterns or bands to appear on the developing teeth. These types of traumas can result in less than normal deposits of enamel, medically termed hypocalcification. The lack of sufficient enamel may cause the teeth to be more sensitive, with exposed dentin (which is normally hidden underneath the enamel), and occasionally fractures of severely compromised teeth. The teeth usually remain fully functional.
"
"Discolored teeth may be found by your veterinarian during a routine physical exam, which normally includes a complete oral exam. Intraoral radiographs (X-rays) can then be taken by your veterinarian to determine if the roots of the teeth are still alive.
"
"
"
"Treatment of your dog's teeth will depend upon the extent of abnormalities and the equipment and materials that are available. Your veterinarian will try to create the smoothest surface possible on the cat's teeth. Prior to receiving any dental work, your dog will be given pre-operative antibiotics and oral pain medication. Your veterinarian will try to gently remove the diseased enamel by scrubbing the enamel with special dental instruments, while taking care not to remove too much enamel and/or dentin or to overheat the insides of the teeth.
"
"If the insides of the teeth have become exposed as the result of the hypocalcification, they will be sealed with a bonding agent that is made to protect the inside of the tooth along with its surface. A strong fluoride treatment that is applied to the teeth can be used in tandem with the other treatments to decrease sensitivity and enhance the enamel’s strength. It must be applied to a dry tooth surface using a varnish or strong sodium fluoride paste. This treatment will be performed under medical guidance in-hospital.
"
"Using fluoride on your dog at home without consulting a veterinarian is not advisable, since fluoride can be toxic, and can itself cause damage to the enamel if not applied properly.
"
"If your dog has been diagnosed with hypocalcemia, your veterinarian will recommend regular professional dental cleaning, about once or twice a year, but possibly more depending on the condition of the teeth. Routine home-care, with a regular brushing program, will also need to be undertaken. If you are unfamiliar with tooth brushing for dogs, ask your veterinarian to demonstrate the proper techniques for you.
"
"Weekly application of stannous fluoride can be done at home, but caution is important. You will need to prevent your dog from having access to the fluoride, or from swallowing it (though a minute amount being swallowed cannot be helped), since stannous fluoride can be toxic in large doses. Excessively chewing on hard objects should also be discouraged.
"
"Dogs can be afflicted with several types of tumors, including in the mouth. Squamous cell carcinomas on the tongue are usually located underneath the tongue, where they attache to the bottom of the mouth. They can be white in color and sometimes have a cauliflower shape. This type of tumor grows and metastasizes quickly to other parts of the body.
"
"A squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can be described as a malignant and particularly invasive tumor that takes hold in the scale like cells of the epithelium – the tissue that covers the body or lines the cavities of the body. These scale like tissue cells are called the squamous. Carcinoma is, by definition, an especially malignant and persistent form of cancer, often returning after is has been excised from the body and metastasizing to other organs and locations on the body.
"
"As with many types of carcinomas, this is usually seen in older dogs. In this case, older than seven years of age.
"
"There is no known cause for squamous cell carcinomas on the tongue.
"
"You will need to provide your veterinarian with a complete medical history leading up to the symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history you have provided, along with the current symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as accidental ingestion of a toxic substance that might have led to mouth sores, or other injury to the mouth.
"
"A full visual inspection will be made of your dog's mouth and tongue, and a sample will be taken from the tumor for laboratory analysis. This is the only assured method for determining whether the tumor is malignant or benign. X-ray images will also be taken of your dog's head and chest to determine if the cancer has spread into the bones, lungs, or brain. Your veterinarian will palpate your dog's lymph nodes to check for swelling – an indication that the body is fighting an invasive disease, and a sample of the lymph fluid will be taken to check for the presence of cancerous cells.
"
"Standard tests include a complete blood count and biochemistry profile to make sure your dog's other organs are functioning normally.
"
"
"
"There are not many effective treatments for these tumors, since many tumors are too large to be removed without causing significant disability, or they are in a location where they cannot practicably be removed. However, sometimes dogs with tumors close to the front, or on one side of the tongue can be treated with surgery. If this is the case, part of the tongue will be removed along with the tumor. Depending on the size and location of the tumor, it may not be possible to remove it in its entirety. For cases such as this, your veterinarian will counsel you on the effectiveness of chemotherapy or radiation therapy for stopping or slowing regrowth of the tumor.
"
"Dogs that have part of their tongue removed generally recover well after surgery but may have trouble eating for some time during the recovery process. Your veterinarian will help guide you in creating a meal plan for your dog. Choices will be limited to soft or liquid foods, and in some cases, a feeding tube may be required until your dog's mouth has healed sufficiently. The feeding tube is usually placed directly in the stomach. If this is necessary, your veterinarian will guide you in the proper technique for placing the tube.
"
"Your veterinarian will help you to plan a meal schedule and will recommend the foods that will be best for your dog during recovery. Be sure to follow your veterinarian's directions closely. If your dog had surgery to remove part of its tongue, it will likely need a feeding tube when it comes home with you. This tube will need to be kept in place until your dog's tongue and mouth have recovered from surgery. Once the feeding tube is removed, your dog will need to continue with a soft food that is easy to digest. You may find that it is helpful to encourage your dog to eat from your hand, using small amounts of food at a time, until it is eating well on its own again.
"
"It is characteristic for carcinomas to return after surgery. While each animal responds differently, in most cases a dog will do well for a few months after treatment or surgery before the disease returns.

"The lungs and kidneys help to maintain a delicate balance of acid and alkali in the blood, both normal components of a healthy blood supply. A condition of metabolic acidosis occurs when there is an increase in the levels of acid in the blood, which ultimately accumulates to abnormal levels in the body, causing various problems. This can occur due to loss of bicarbonate (alkali); acid production by increased metabolism; excess acid introduction into the body through an external source like ethylene glycol (resulting in ethylene toxicity); or by the kidney’s inability to excrete acid, which it normally does to maintain its level. Metabolic acidosis can occur in dogs of any age, size, gender, or breed.
"
"Symptoms can vary considerably, especially if your dog is concurrently suffering from other health problems like diabetes or kidney disease. The most common symptoms that you may notice in a dog that is suffering from metabolic acidosis include:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition (such as suspected antifreeze ingestion, or use of aspirin to treat your dog). The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms.
"
"Your veterinarian will then perform a thorough physical examination on your dog. For the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, a compete blood chemical profile will be performed to check the levels of acid and alkali in the body. The next step is to find the underlying cause of the metabolic acidosis in order to treat that problem along with correcting the acid level. Therefore, other test panels may also be used along with the blood chemical profile.
"
"
"
"The treatment of metabolic acidosis is usually twofold. It involves the correction of the disturbed acid-base balance as well as addressing any underlying diseases, such as diabetes and/or kidney failure. Your veterinarian will give suitable fluid therapy in order to correct the acid balance. If the acidosis is mild, your dog will be able to go home after a short treatment. However, in cases of severe or complicated acidosis, your dog may need to be hospitalized for few days until it has stabilized. Diagnosis of the underlying problem/disease causing the acidosis is crucial for preventing future episodes of metabolic acidosis.
"
"After returning from the hospital, keep a close eye on your dog for few days. If your dog starts behaving in a depressed manner, or is breathing rapidly even while at rest, check with your veterinarian. This is especially important for dogs dealing with some chronic health problems like diabetes, in which the next episode of metabolic acidosis may occur at any time.

"A squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsils is an aggressive and metastatic tumor that arises from the epithelial cells of the tonsils. The epithelium is the cellular covering of all of the internal and external surfaces of the body, protecting the organs, inner cavities and outer surfaces of the body in a continuous layer of multi-layered tissue. The squamous epithelium is a type of epithelium that consists of the outer layer of flat, scale-like cells, which are called squamous cells. While all types of squamous cell carcinomas are invasive, carcinoma of the tonsils is particularly aggressive.
"
"This type of tumor is highly invasive and local extension into the surrounding areas is common. This tumor also metastasizes to other areas of the body, including the nearby lungs and distant organs. As with other types of squamous cell carcinomas, middle-aged and older dogs are more commonly affected. In this case, the incidence is higher in dogs living in urban areas as compared to those in rural environments.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough medical history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a physical examination, which will include a thorough examination of the lymph nodes in the neck area. Abnormally large lymph nodes are indicative of an immune system response to an invasion, but only a laboratory examination of the lymph node fluid and tissue will show the type of involvement. That is, whether the invasion is viral, bacterial, or cancerous in nature.
"
"After the initial examination, your veterinarian will order routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count, biochemical profiles, and urinalysis. The results of these tests are usually normal in these patients unless some concurrent disease is present. Your veterinarian will take a biopsy from the lymph nodes to be sent to a veterinary pathologist. This tissue sample will be processed  and analyzed microscopically for cancerous cells in order to reach a definitive diagnosis. Your veterinarian may also take X-rays of your dog's skull and thoracic regions to search for evidence of metastasis. Skull X-rays in some patients may show bone involvement -- where the tumor has spread into the bone -- and thoracic X-rays can help identify the amount of metastasis into the lungs.
"
"Your veterinarian may also take X-rays of your dog's skull and thoracic regions to search for evidence of metastasis. Skull X-rays in some patients may show bone involvement -- where the tumor has spread into the bone -- and thoracic X-rays can help identify the amount metastasis into the lungs.
"
"
"
"Surgery may be used to perform an aggressive excision of the tonsils and affected tissue. However, most patients at the time of diagnosis are inoperable, either because of the location of the tumor, or the extent to which it has spread before its effects have been observed.
"
"Removal of the affected lymph nodes may be conducted to prevent further spreading of cancerous cells, but it seldom provides a permanent cure. Radiotherapy may also be used in some patients, but its success has not been satisfactorily confirmed, so it is seldom used for these patients.
"
"In cases where it is possible to operate and remove most of the affected area, the tumor and affected lymph nodes will be removed, and the surgery will be followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy to prevent or slow down the spread of cancerous cells to other areas of the body.
"
"Good nutritional support will be essential for ensuring the maintenance of your dog's body weight and condition. It is important to monitor your dog's food and water intake while it is recovering. After surgery, your dog will very likely not have much of an appetite, and will not want to eat or drink in great quantities. It may be necessary to temporarily use a feeding tube. In these cases you veterinarian will show you how to use the feeding tube correctly (placing it directly into the dog's stomach), and will assist you in setting up a feeding schedule.
"
"After surgery, you should expect your dog to feel sore. To minimize discomfort, your veterinarian will provide you with pain medication for your dog. In addition, you will need to set up an area in the house where your dog can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Trips outdoors for bladder and bowel relief should be kept short and easy for your dog to handle during the recovery period. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication.
"
"Overall prognosis in affected animals is poor due to the aggressive nature of this tumor and frequency of metastasis to other body locations. Even with treatment, overall survival time generally is not more than several months. The decision to go forward with surgery or chemical therapy will be based on the actual prognosis. In some cases, end of life pain management may be in order.

"Nicotine exposure can be very dangerous for your dog. Traditionally found in tobacco products such as cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco, nicotine is now also found in e-cigarettes, patches, gum, and other products formulated to help users reduce their tobacco dependency. Often these newer products are flavored, making ingestion more common for our canine companions. Though secondhand smoke has other negative health effects for your dog, nicotine toxicity by inhalation is very rare.
"
"Nicotine is a stimulant that targets specific receptors in mammalian nerves normally used by acetylcholine to activate them. As toxicity results in activation of an abnormal number of receptors, affected nerves become overstimulated and fire rapidly. Larger amounts can overwhelm the entire nervous system.
"
"Nicotine ingestion by your dog should be treated as an emergency and decontamination should be attempted as soon as possible. Symptoms usually begin within an hour of ingestion. Managing symptoms of toxicity once they appear often requires hospitalization and intensive care.
"
"The signs of nicotine toxicity in dogs vary significantly, depending on the concentration of nicotine in the product and how much of the product is ingested. Overstimulated nerves can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, drooling, and vomiting, as well as agitation, excitement, and constricted pupils. Higher doses can cause seizures, confusion, difficulty walking, and an elevated heart rate. Ingestion of more than 9-12 mg/kg of nicotine without decontamination will likely result in death.
"
"In general, patches contain the largest concentration of nicotine and are the most dangerous to dogs. But even a cigarette butt can contain enough nicotine to cause illness. Careful attention must also be paid to nicotine gums. These often have lower concentrations of nicotine but may also contain xylitol, which is also toxic for dogs.
"
"Ingestion of nicotine products is more common now with the flavored products available, though young dogs and puppies may still find ash trays or e-cigarettes a tempting target, despite the foul flavors. It is important to keep these products out of reach of your dog, and to pay attention to where discarded products and mostly empty cartridges end up. 
"
"Diagnosis of nicotine toxicity is highly dependent on known exposure or evidence of tobacco products in a dog’s vomit. Clinical signs can be very similar to those of other stimulant poisonings, such as with chocolate, but there are no specific tests to confirm it. Notify your veterinarian immediately of any access to these products if you see symptoms of toxicity.
"
"If exposure is noted promptly, within an hour, the usual treatment is decontamination. Luckily, nicotine is not well-absorbed through the stomach lining, so if vomiting can be induced before the products make it to the small intestine, toxicity may be avoided. Do not induce vomiting at home, as your vet will have safer medications for this process. It is important that your dog receive care as soon as possible to manage any potential complications.
"
"After vomiting, activated charcoal may be given to your dog to bind any nicotine still left in the stomach. Your veterinarian may also choose to sedate your dog and wash its stomach through a tube passed down the throat.
"
"Hospitalization will often be recommended, even in mild cases of toxicity, to support your dog through the breakdown and excretion of any remaining toxin. Nicotine is broken down in the liver and then released in the urine. A urine acidifier may help speed this process.
"
"Dogs with tremors, seizures, or cardiovascular symptoms may need additional medications to lessen these symptoms while the toxin is eliminated. Often these medications will need to be given by injection. Severe cases may require that your dog to be put on a ventilator.
"
"Nicotine toxicity and recovery follows a fairly rapid timeline. Clinical signs are usually noted within the hour. If a dog can be supported successfully through the first four hours after onset of symptoms, they are very likely to recover. It is rare for a dog to be hospitalized longer than 24-48 hours.
"
"Prognosis for nicotine ingestion varies significantly, depending on dose. Low-dose exposures managed appropriately have an excellent prognosis, with a low likelihood of long-term effects. Dogs that experience prolonged seizure activity or significant cardiac changes may suffer permanent brain or other organ damage, but even high-dose exposures that are managed promptly and are successfully stabilized can result in a complete recovery.

"Tick paralysis in dogs is a devastating condition that causes sudden hind limb paralysis that quickly progresses to the rest of a pup's body. As a result, dogs are unable to walk, hold their head up, or fully swallow. In severe cases, they cannot breathe due to paralysis of the diaphragm.
"
"Fortunately, tick paralysis is relatively uncommon in dogs due to the widespread use of tick preventatives by pet parents; however, certain geographic areas may see a greater number of cases due to higher tick numbers. The condition is more common in the warmer months when ticks are most active. To minimize exposure to ticks in their natural habitat, dogs should not be allowed to roam in tall grass or wooded areas. Ticks love to attach themselves to anyone walking by! 
"
"When an adult female tick bites your dog, they release saliva that contains neurotoxins into your pup’s bloodstream. These neurotoxins damage nerve cells, resulting in whole-body paralysis. Ticks must be attached to your dog for at least three days before paralysis, which is why it’s very important to check your dog for ticks after being outdoors and to regularly use tick preventatives.
"
"Tick paralysis can result in death without prompt diagnosis and treatment. Death occurs most commonly in dogs that already have breathing difficulties or weakened immune systems.
"
"If your dog has been bitten by a tick and is experiencing difficulty walking or breathing, seek veterinary attention immediately.
"
"Tick paralysis in dogs is considered a medical emergency, as it progresses quickly and is fatal if left untreated.
"
"Tick paralysis in dogs has many classic symptoms, which may include:
"
"Leg weakness
"
"Lack of coordination
"
"Inability to walk
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Coughing
"
"Gagging with or without vomiting
"
"Vomiting
"
"Loss of bladder and bowel control
"
"Loss of facial tone, droopiness
"
"Dilated pupils
"
"Changes in your dog’s normal bark
"
"Tick paralysis in dogs is caused by a tick bite. Neurotoxins are transmitted from the tick’s saliva to the bloodstream, resulting in loss of muscle tone and paralysis. The Rocky Mountain wood tick and the American dog tick cause paralysis.
"
"There are no specific tests available to diagnose tick paralysis in dogs. Instead, veterinarians collect a thorough history from the pet parent and identify common symptoms during a physical exam. Let your veterinarian know of any recent tick exposure and when your dog’s symptoms first began.
"
"During the exam, your veterinarian will thoroughly inspect your dog’s skin and fur for any ticks. Sometimes the tick is found, while other times only a red, circular wound is visible where a tick was attached.
"
"Common areas for ticks to attach include:
"
"The ears
"
"In skin folds
"
"In between the paw pads
"
"Underneath the tail
"
"On the belly
"
"If your dog has recently had tick exposure, is suddenly paralyzed, and has difficulty breathing, a diagnosis of tick paralysis is very likely.
"
"Additionally, blood work may be performed to assess your dog’s overall health prior to treatment.
"
"Removal of the tick is essential in treating tick paralysis in dogs. If the tick remains attached it can transfer neurotoxins and worsen a dog’s condition, ultimately leading to respiratory paralysis and death.
"
"Tooth luxation is the clinical term for a dislocation of the tooth from its normal spot in the mouth. The mutation can be vertical (downward) or lateral (on either side).
"
"In vertical luxation, the tooth may move up (intrusion) or down (extrusion) in its bony socket. In lateral lunation, the tooth tips to the side. Lateral luxation usually occurs due to an injury that has pushed the tip of the tooth to one side. Vertical luxation is related to the dislocation of the root of the tooth. A tooth is called avulsed, meaning that it has been torn suddenly from its spot, if it has been luxated completely from its bony socket.
"
"In cases of intrusion, the affected tooth appears shorter than normal. In extrusion, the tooth appears longer than normal and can be moved both vertically and horizontally when touched. In case of lateral luxation, the upper part of the tooth is found deviated on the either side. It may be overlapping a nearby tooth to some degree. In cases where there is avulsion of the tooth, the tooth is found to have become completely displaced from its bony socket. This is most often as the result of an injury to the mouth, or to an infection at or near the tooth.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents -- such as recent injuries -- that might have preceded this condition. Your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination and will closely look into your dog's mouth to evaluate the complete set of teeth. The close physical examination will enable your veterinarian to see if the tooth is luxated or avulsed and whether it can be saved. The most important diagnostic test is radiographic imaging of the tooth arcade, i.e., mouth cavity. X-ray films will be placed into the oral cavity to take an X-ray of the affected teeth. Typical changes will enable your veterinarian to precisely diagnose and treat the condition.
"
"
"
"Surgery can usually be conducted to fix the tooth back to its normal position using various materials, including fine wires. Anesthesia will be required for conducting the surgery to prevent pain related to this procedure as well as movement by the dog. For this reason, your dog's health and any other underlying conditions will be taken into consideration, since some animals are at an increased risk for anesthesia complications and the risk may not be worth saving the tooth.
"
"If your dog is a good candidate for the oral surgery, time is a crucial factor for the successful outcome of the surgery. The sooner the avulsed tooth is placed back in its bony socket, the better the chances are for recovery. The best results are typically achieved when the avulsed tooth is placed back in its socket within 30 minutes of its avulsion.
"
"If you have found yourself in a situation where your dog has had its tooth forced from its mouth, by trauma or other causes, you can place the avulsed tooth in a normal saline solution to protect it from damage and take it to your veterinarian along with your dog. If you don’t have saline at home, you can also place the tooth in a small amount of milk to keep it safe until it can be delivered to your veterinarian. You should not waste time getting the avulsed tooth to the veterinarian. Once the tooth has been fixed in place again, it usually takes 4-6 weeks for the tooth to properly reimplant in the socket.
"
"Antibiotics are standard after the surgical procedure for the prevention of infection, and a mild pain reliever may be prescribed to keep your dog comfortable. After a period of 4-6 weeks, the fixation material will be removed and X-rays will be taken to confirm the reimplantation of the affected tooth. If the tooth has not properly fixed, it will need to be removed due to fixation failure.
"
"For a few days after the surgery, your dog should not be fed hard foods. Your veterinarian will recommend a temporary soft diet that will be beneficial to healthy bone reformation, and that will not move the tooth out of its socket during this period in which the tooth is resetting. Also during this time, do not allow your dog to pick up solid objects with its mouth to prevent further trauma to the implanted tooth.
"
"Maintenance and good oral hygiene after surgery is of paramount importance for the full recovery of your dog's tooth. Daily rinsing with antiseptic solution is usually required in these animals. Your veterinarian will brief you on the correct method of cleaning your dog's teeth, as well as the best procedures for removing debris, food particles and other material from the space in between the teeth, including the implanted tooth. Oral rinses are available for dogs, which can be used to maintain good oral hygiene. However, you should only use oral rinses under the recommendation of your veterinarian.

"Removing the tick generally leads to reversal of symptoms and rapid improvement in the dog’s condition.
"
"It’s important to remove all ticks and to routinely recheck your dog’s skin and fur.
"
"Most dogs experiencing tick paralysis need hospitalization for supportive care. This may include:
"
"Intravenous fluids
"
"Oxygen therapy
"
"Anti-nausea medications
"
"Warming blankets
"
"Other medications
"
"Dogs with severe disease may require intubation for assisted breathing during recovery. Urinary catheters may also be used to help empty their bladders.
"
"Topical tick preventatives, such as Bravecto® or K9 Advantix™, may be applied during hospitalization to kill any ticks that may still be hiding in your dog’s fur.
"
"Most dogs recover from tick paralysis with prompt treatment. If all ticks are removed, a pup will generally recover within 24 to 72 hours. However, it’s important to reduce stress and anxiety during the recovery period. Give your dog a quiet area to rest, away from other pets.
"
"Unfortunately, some dogs don’t respond well to treatment or have developed severe symptoms, such as breathing difficulty, because of the paralysis. Humane euthanasia may be recommended by your veterinarian in a small percentage of these cases.
"
"The best form of prevention of tick paralysis in dogs is applying topical or administering oral tick preventatives year-round to your dog. These products effectively prevent and kill ticks that pose a risk to pets.
"
"Regularly examining your dog’s fur and coat for ticks is also important.
"
"Since a tick must be attached for three days before symptoms of tick paralysis develop, prompt removal of any ticks that may have attached to your dog can prevent the condition. To avoid exposure to ticks, dogs should not be allowed to roam in tall grass or wooded areas.
"
"The survival rate of dogs with tick paralysis is high if treatment is started early.  
"
"A tick must be attached for at least three days before symptoms develop in dogs.
"
"Tick paralysis in dogs is curable in most cases if your pup is treated promptly. If your dog is not seen by a veterinarian until they have breathing difficulties, the outlook is poor.

"Tick-borne diseases are a group of infections transmitted by ticks, which pick up infectious organisms, such as bacteria or protozoa, while feeding on wild animals like mice or birds. When a tick attaches to a dog, it can transmit the infectious organisms through its saliva into the dog’s bloodstream. Ticks must be attached to the dog for at least 24 to 48 hours to transmit an infection. Less commonly, dogs can contract a tick-borne disease by ingesting an infected tick. 
"
"Tick-borne diseases are relatively common in certain US regions, but the widespread use of tick preventives by pet parents helps control overall infection rates. Ticks are most common in geographic areas that are heavily wooded and have tall grass, streams, or rivers. Ticks can be found throughout the United States, but high populations are present in the Southeast, Northeast, and Midwest, and on the West Coast.
"
"The most common tick-borne diseases in dogs include:
"
"Anaplasmosis
"

"Dogs with a tick-borne disease may experience the following symptoms:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Fever
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes
"
"Weight loss
"
"Lameness
"
"Joint pain
"
"Eye discharge

"
"Pale gums
"
"Breathing difficulties
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Bloody urine
"
"Muscle wasting
"
"Yellowing of the skin or eyes
"
"Not all dogs with tick-borne diseases experience symptoms. Some dogs with strong immune systems are able to control the infection before symptoms develop. Young dogs, old dogs, and those with weakened immune systems may experience more severe disease.
"
"A dog with a history of tick exposure who develops symptoms of a tick-borne disease should always see a veterinarian as soon as possible. Tick-borne diseases can progress quickly and can become fatal if left untreated. 
"
"Dogs can contract a tick-borne disease following exposure to ticks, especially during the warmer months when ticks are generally more active.
"
"Ticks can be found throughout the U.S.; however, certain geographic areas have higher populations due to the presence of heavily wooded areas, tall grass, and fields. Dogs living in or traveling to these areas are more likely to contract a tick-borne disease. Additionally, dogs who don’t receive year-round tick prevention medications are at an increased risk.
"
"To diagnose tick-born disease in dogs, your veterinarian will start by collecting a thorough medical history of your pup, including any symptoms and when they began.
"
"Discuss any recent travel history and potential tick exposure with your veterinarian during the visit. Your vet will also conduct a physical exam to check for abnormalities consistent with a tick-borne disease.
"
"Because most tick-borne diseases have similar symptoms, diagnostic tests can help your veterinarian identify the cause. Tests that help diagnose tick-borne diseases include:
"
"Snap 4Dx: This simple in-office test requires only a few drops of your dog’s blood, and can within minutes diagnose Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis.
"
"Serology: Serum, which is the liquid part of your dog’s blood, is sent to a veterinary diagnostic lab and tested for antibodies against tick-borne diseases.
"
"Blood smear: A drop of blood is spread on a glass slide, stained, and viewed under a microscope to check for signs of infection or infectious organisms.
"
"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): A blood, joint fluid, or lymph node sample is sent to a lab for testing to diagnose tick-borne diseases.
"
"Blood work: Your vet may need to perform blood work to check your dog’s red and white blood cells, platelets, and internal organ function. While this test alone does not diagnose tick-borne diseases, it’s helpful to assess your dog’s overall health. 
"
"Urinalysis: Urine testing can help assess your dog’s kidney function and can identify protein in the urine, which may indicate a tick-borne disease.
"
"Treatment for tick-borne disease in dogs will depend on which tick-borne disease a dog has. In some cases, dogs may be infected with more than one tick-borne infection. Common treatments include:
"
"Antibiotics: An antibiotic called doxycycline is commonly used to treat Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It is generally given for at least three to four weeks to eliminate the bacterial infection.
"
"Antiprotozoal medications: Dogs with babesiosis are treated with an antiprotozoal medication called imidocarb dipropionate. Hepatozoonosis is typically treated with pyrimethamine, as well as the antibiotics trimethoprim-sulfa and clindamycin.
"
"Anti-inflammatories: Some dogs may benefit from corticosteroids, such as prednisone, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation and relieve pain and discomfort.
"
"Dogs with severe disease often require hospitalization and supportive care. This may include:
"
"Intravenous (IV) fluids
"
"IV antibiotics
"
"Anti-inflammatories
"
"Appetite stimulants
"
"Oxygen therapy
"
"Anti-nausea medications
"
"Dogs with severe anemia may require blood transfusions.
"
"If appropriate treatment for tick-borne disease in dogs is started promptly after symptoms begin, pups generally recover from tick-borne diseases caused by bacteria, including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
"
"Dogs typically start to feel better one to two days after antibiotics are started, but it can take weeks for them to make a full recovery. Babesiosis and hepatazoonosis are less predictable, and can be fatal despite treatment.
"
"Unfortunately, some dogs with tick-borne diseases will experience lasting effects, such as joint pain or lameness, which persist for months or years after the initial infection. These dogs may benefit from long-term anti-inflammatories or pain medications to keep them comfortable. Hepatozoonosis is generally considered a lifelong infection because treatment does not completely eliminate the infectious organisms. Dogs with this disease will require ongoing management.
"
"Always follow your veterinarian’s instructions regarding medications, at-home care, and follow-up visits to support a quicker recovery.
"
"You can protect your dog in several ways from tick-borne disease. Most importantly, use a topical tick preventive such as Simparica Trio™, NexGard®, or Revolution® year-round to prevent ticks from attaching to your dog.
"
"When walking your dog, avoid areas with tall grass and woods to reduce the risk of tick exposure. Regularly scan your dog’s fur and skin for ticks and promptly remove any you may find.
"
"Puppies over 8 weeks of age and adult dogs who are at risk for Lyme disease, such as those who live near wooded areas or in areas where the disease is prevalent, should receive the Lyme disease vaccine. 
"
"Dogs can survive tick-borne diseases with prompt and appropriate treatment. However, if the disease is left untreated, symptoms may progress quickly and lead to death. Babesiosis and hepatozoonosis in particular are unpredictable and may be fatal despite treatment.
"
"Ticks must be attached to a dog for at least 24 to 48 hours to transmit the infectious organisms that cause tick-borne diseases.
"
"Some tick-borne diseases in dogs are curable; however, dogs may experience lasting effects, such as lameness. Hepatozoonosis is not curable and requires long-term management.

"Myxedema coma is a rare condition in dogs characterized by an under-functioning thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Affected dogs become cold, extremely weak, and mentally dull/depressed. Animals with myxedema have a drop in metabolism, in the oxygen production in their cells, and in calorie production. This diseased condition has a high mortality rate. Affected animals may progress from depressed, to comatose, to dead in relatively short order. Successful treatment is reliant upon early recognition of the disorder and prompt and appropriate medical treatment.
"
"The name myxedema refers to the swelling above the eyes, and in the jowls that these patients display. This edema occurs because of an increase in dermal ground substances in their skin (the jelly like material in which collagen bundles are based in the skin).
"
"Myxedema coma has been most commonly reported in Doberman pinschers.
"
"  
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, with a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. A specific blood test for thyroxine levels (the thyroid gland hormone that regulates the metabolic rate) will indicate (along with clinical signs) for certain whether or not your pet is suffering from myxedema. You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health, including a description of the onset of symptoms.
"
"Chest and abdominal x-rays will also be taken to look for effusion (excess fluid) and swelling in your pet’s lungs.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will warm your pet with blankets in order to raise the body temperature to a healthy level. Warming your pet too quickly is very dangerous to its health, and must be done with care. Fluid therapy may also be administered.  If your pet is having trouble breathing, it will be placed in an oxygen cage, but if it has not had enough oxygen for some time, it may be placed on a respirator. Appropriate medicine will be given to increase your pet’s metabolism, and your veterinarian will probably prescribe antibiotics as well.
"
"Myxedema coma generally has a grave prognosis. Most patients who have died of this disease have died within a day of having begun treatment, even though their vital signs appeared to have improved.

"In a dog’s neck, the two lobes of the thyroid gland lie on either side of the trachea. The gland is responsible for producing a thyroid hormone to help regulate the body’s metabolism. Tumors of the thyroid gland can be either benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
"
"Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians.
"
"Malignant thyroid tumors may affect one or both lobes of the thyroid, with the potential to spread to other places in the body. In some cases, dogs can have thyroid tissue elsewhere in the body. It’s called ectopic thyroid tissue, and this tissue is also at risk of developing cancer. Ectopic thyroid tissue is rare, but most commonly found at the base of the tongue.
"
"Thyroid cancer is locally invasive, meaning it can grow bigger in one area, but also has the potential for metastasis, or spreading to other organs. The most common places for thyroid invasion locally include the trachea and the esophagus. For systemic spread (metastasis), the lymph nodes are most common, followed by the lungs. These tumors have usually already spread at the time of a diagnosis.
"
"Benign thyroid tumors, called adenomas, will not spread or have a long-term impact on your dog’s health. However, these tumors as uncommon, as about 90 percent of thyroid tumors in dogs are malignant. Malignant (cancerous) thyroid tumors are called carcinomas, meaning these are a type of tumor originating from epithelial tissue, in this case the thyroid gland.
"
"Many dogs with thyroid cancer may not have any symptoms at all. In most cases, the mass can be felt by running your hands down the underside of the neck. In later stages, the thyroid tumor may start to invade local tissue, such as the trachea, which could lead to coughing, exercise intolerance, and changes in respirations. If the esophagus is similarly affected, common symptoms include hard swallowing or trouble eating.
"
"More nonspecific symptoms seen in dogs with thyroid cancer include:
"
"Weight loss
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Changes in bark
"
"Lethargy
"
"In dogs, as in humans, there is not much known about why a certain tumor develops. It is thought to be a multifactorial process influenced by several different things, including:
"
"Breed
"
"Sex
"
"Genetic links or family traits
"
"Environment
"
"There are certain breeds that are overrepresented in thyroid cancer diagnoses, including:
"
"Golden Retrievers
"
"Beagles
"
"Boxers
"
"Huskies
"
"Diagnosis of thyroid cancer starts the same as for most other disease processes—a full body workup. Your veterinarian may recommend the following non-invasive tests for diagnosis.
"
"A physical exam, in which a mass can be felt
"
"Blood work to look for changes in white cell counts or organ function
"
"Chest X-rays to evaluate for metastasis or spread of disease
"
"Ultrasound of the neck, which can show the size of the tumor and may be helpful to evaluate the size of the lymph nodes in the neck
"
"In dogs, once a thyroid tumor is suspected, a CT or MRI may be ordered prior to surgery to evaluate for any spread of disease. CT scans and MRIs are anesthetic procedures and may take several hours and advance planning to accomplish. For a definitive diagnosis, a surgical biopsy would be needed.
"
"As with most cancers, there are a variety of treatment options depending on the type and spread of the tumor. Routine options for management of canine thyroid cancers include:
"
"Surgery
"
"Chemotherapy
"
"Radiation
"
"For dogs with thyroid tumors with minimal invasion to local tissues, surgery is typically recommended. This procedure is called a thyroidectomy, where the tumor is physically removed and sent to the lab for a biopsy to confirm the type of cancer (benign or malignant).
"
"Depending on the amount of tumor that can be removed, follow-up with chemotherapy or radiation may be recommended. Radiation and chemotherapy are a multistep process and are performed at various time intervals for several weeks, depending on the type of chemotherapy and radiation used.
"
"In dogs who are not good candidates for surgery, due to the extensive nature of the mass or other underlying diseases that put them at risk for anesthetic complications, radioactive iodine (I-131) is an option. It is injected into the patient and destroys active cancerous tissue. This is a common therapy in cats, but due to the large doses needed, may be prohibitive in dogs due to cost and availability.
"
"While there are risks with any anesthetic and surgical procedure, most dogs do well post-operatively after thyroidectomies and have no major complications. Recovery may require overnight monitoring in the hospital, with a next day discharge, in most cases.
"
"Prognosis and life expectancy depend on the size and spread of the tumor. For thyroid tumors that are completely surgically removed, the median survival time can be upwards of two years. For tumors that require followup with chemotherapy and/or radiation, the prognosis is still good, with a median survival time ranging from 18 to 24 months. For dogs undergoing radiation and chemotherapy without surgical intervention, prognosis is poor, with an average survival time of between 6 and 12 months depending on the metastasis.
"
"Thyroid cancer has a fast rate of spread, with about 35 percent of dogs already having metastasis at the time of diagnosis.
"
"Depending on the type of treatments used, life expectancy can range from six months to two years.

"Dog thunderstorm anxiety is a disorder characterized by a persistent and exaggerated fear of storms, or the stimuli that are associated with storms. This phobia is complicated and sometimes difficult to manage because it involves physiologic, emotional, and behavioral components.
"
"Thunderstorm phobia occurs in both dogs and cats, but dogs are more susceptible to this type of fear.
"
"The exact cause of dog storm anxiety is unknown, but it may include a combination of the following factors:
"
"Lack of exposure to storms early in development
"
"Unintentional reinforcement of the fear response by owners
"
"A genetic predisposition for emotional reactivity (the condition appears to be more common in herding breeds)
"
"Dogs can react to a variety of stimuli associated with storms, including the sound of thunder, dropping barometric pressure, rain, flashes of lightening, and electrical charges within the air.
"
"Dogs can exhibit a variety of responses or behaviors in reaction to a thunderstorm. Some common signs of a thunderstorm phobia include:
"
"Pacing
"
"Panting

"Trembling
"
"Hiding or remaining near the owner
"
"Drooling
"
"Destructiveness
"
"Excessive vocalization
"
"Self-inflicted trauma
"
"Incontinence
"
"Your veterinarian will need to rule out any conditions that can cause similar behavioral responses, such as separation anxiety, pain, and neurologic problems.
"
"Additional testing may be necessary to ensure that the dog is healthy enough to be given anti-anxiety medications, if that is deemed necessary.
"
"Fear, anxiety, and stress can affect body systems in a variety of ways, including:
"
"Cardiovascular—high heart rate
"
"Endocrine/metabolic—increased cortisol levels, stress-induced hyperglycemia
"
"Gastrointestinal—inappetence, gastrointestinal upset
"
"Musculoskeletal—trauma resulting from escape attempts
"
"Respiratory—rapid breathing
"
"Skin—acral lick dermatitis (skin damage due to chronic licking that is thought to release endorphins and promote a sense of calm)
"
"If your dog’s thunderstorm phobia is severe, and storms occur with some regularity where you live, the chronic effects could lead to a decreased quality of life and potentially problems like immune dysfunction and an increased risk of infection.
"
"Talk with your veterinarian to decide the best way to approach and help manage your dog’s anxiety-induced behaviors.
"
"Most dogs cannot be cured of their thunderstorm phobias, but management is possible. In a study published in 2003, 30 out of 32 dogs showed significant improvement in their symptoms with appropriate therapy.
"
"It’s perfectly acceptable to offer comfort if your dog seeks it during a storm. It’s a common misconception that doing so might accidentally reinforce your dog’s fear, but fear is a visceral response that can’t be altered by a petting or kind words.
"
"Playing some calming music to mask the sound of the storm and offering your dog a food puzzle or chew might help your dog refocus during a storm. Plan ahead and try to anticipate noxious events. Watch the news to anticipate weather events so you can begin calming your dog before it even begins.
"
"Create a safe, calm space where your pet cannot hurt themselves, such as a crate. You can even cover the crate with a blanket to decrease visual stimulus and mute sounds. You can also decrease auditory stimulus by conditioning your dog to wearing headphones or using cotton balls in their ears.
"
"Body wraps like the ThunderShirt® ease anxiety in fearful dogs, but allow your dog enough time to acclimate to a ThunderShirt prior to using it during a storm. Introduce the garment slowly and use treats to help your dog make a positive association to it. The Thundercap® is a great addition to the Thundershirt to allow your dog to comfortably move around while decreasing noxious stimulants like flashing lights.
"
"Calming pheromones like those included in Adaptil® diffusers, collars, and sprays are another good option.
"
"Anxiety-relieving nutritional supplements like Nutramax® Solliquin® calming chews and VetriScience® Composure™ behavioral health chews may also help dogs that are scared of thunder or other stimuli associated with storms.
"
"Prescription anti-anxiety medications for dogs are sometimes needed with more severe storm phobias or for dogs who do not respond to over-the-counter treatments. Your veterinarian can also recommend a behavioral modification plan to help your dog learn to remain calm when a thunderstorm approaches.
"
"While your veterinarian has many prescription options to help treat thunderstorm phobia, you may want to talk to them about the product Sileo®. It's the first and only FDA-approved noise aversion treatment for dogs.

"A chondrosarcoma is one of several types of laryngeal tumors that can effect the larynx and trachea of a dog. This is a relatively rare and fast spreading tumor that originates in the cartilage, a connective collagenous tissue that is found throughout the body.
"
"Over time, this type of tumor progresses, aggressively involving the surrounding tissues. As with many sarcomas, chondrosarcoma of the larynx and trachea is more common in middle aged and older dogs. All breeds are at risk, but males are often at a slightly higher risk than females.
"
"Most symptoms are related to involvement of the larynx, trachea and the surrounding tissues.
"
"The exact cause is still unknown.
"
"Your veterinarian will need a complete background medical history leading up to your dog's disease symptoms. Routine blood tests include a complete blood cell count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis and platelet count. The results are frequently normal in such cases.
"
"Radiographic studies of the neck and chest can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis, along with imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scans. Another technique your veterinarian may choose is bronchoscopy, by which a tubular device is inserted into the body, in this case through the mouth and down into the windpipe, so that a more detailed visual examination can be conducted. This type of instrument can also sometimes be used to take a sample of tissue for biopsy, alleviating the need for a more invasive presurgical resection at the site.
"
"Samples of fluid from the surrounding area may also be taken, and samples from the lymph nodes may show an abnormal amount of white blood cells, as the immune system reacts to the cancerous tumor.
"
"Radiographs of the area will show whether metastasis has taken place.
"
"
"
"Being aggressive and malignant in nature, chondrosarcomas of the larynx and trachea are usually life-threatening. Your veterinarian will need to excise the tumor tissue and possibly the surrounding tissue. As this tumor can affect very vital site of body, preservation of functions is very important. Your veterinarian will also be working to preserve laryngeal functions. The affected part of the trachea will need to be removed entirely by resection, and both ends of the normal trachea sutured together, a process referred to as anastomosis. Radiotherapy is generally not effective in patients with chondrosarcoma of the larynx and trachea.
"
"A dog that has been affected by this type of cancer may survive for a few months, but even after successful treatment the life span of such patients is quite low. Quality of life is another important consideration and many owners ask for peaceful euthanasia of their dogs rather than have them undergo the stress of surgery.
"
"Good nutritional support is essential in these patients for ensuring maintenance of body weight and condition. It is important to monitor your dog's food and water intake while it is recovering. After surgery, your dog will very likely not have much of an appetite, and will not want to eat or drink in great quantities. It may be necessary to temporarily use a feeding tube placed directly into the stomach so that it is getting all of the nutrition it needs to completely recover. Your veterinarian will show you how to use the feeding tube correctly, and will assist you in setting up a feeding schedule.
"
"After surgery, you should expect your dog to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your dog to help minimize discomfort, and you will need to set up a place in the house where your dog can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Trips outdoors for bladder and bowel relief should be kept short and easy for your dog to handle during the recovery period. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication.

"Preventative care is a key part of keeping your dog healthy and happy—and one of the best ways you can prevent potential health issues is to use monthly flea and tick preventatives. Here’s what to know about fleas, ticks, and how to protect our dogs.
"
"  
"
"Candida is a type of sugar-digesting yeast that forms part of the normal flora in an animal’s mouth, nose, ears, and gastrointestinal and genital tracts. This type of yeast is opportunistic and will sometimes colonize or invade damaged tissues of immuno-suppressed animals. Candidiasis occurs when there is an overgrowth of Candida in an dog’s body. This type of fungal infection can afflict dogs of any age and breed, even if itl has no predisposing conditions. The infection can take place in one specific part of the body (local), or it can colonize the entire body (systemic). Either affliction is likely to cause extreme discomfort to a dog.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"How the symptoms of candidiasis manifest largely depends on where the infection takes place. In the case of an ear infection, a common symptom is constant shaking and scratching the head. If Candida settles in the oral cavity, there will usually be an abnormal amount of drooling. If it involves the urinary bladder, the animal may experience inflammation of the bladder (cystitis). Inflammation around areas of intravenous (IV) catheters and gastronomy tubes, fever, skin irritation, and open sores on the skin (ulcerative lesions), are also common signs of candidiasis.
"
"The causes and risk factors of candidiasis are numerous. Dogs that have skin that has been traumatized, damaged by burns, or that has dying and inflamed tissue (necrotizing dermatitis) carry an increased risk of acquiring the condition. The same can be said for dogs which have neutropenia, a viral (parvovirus) infection. Some of the conditions which can open the door to the Candida fungus are diabetes, urinary retention caused by narrowing of the ureter tubes (typically following a urethrostomy, an artificial opening into the urethra to allow urine to pass). Dogs with indwelling catheters are also at higher risk of contracting candidiasis.
"
"The diagnostic procedure for candidiasis can be carried out in a number of ways. In case of lesions, a biopsy to confirm or dismiss diseased tissue is conducted. This biopsy will determine whether or not yeast organisms have penetrated the affected tissues. A urine sample will also be taken. The presence of Candida colonies and a simultaneous bacterial infection in the urinary tract will point to candidiasis. The urine analysis will also show yeast forms, or clumps, of mycelial elements. A swab is taken from the ear and this is cultured for the presence of Candida. In dogs that have a fever, tips of catheters are cultured for both bacteria and fungi. Infected tissues will normally contain a white, cheesy foci. In inflamed tissues, tests will find large numbers of yeast organisms in the event of candidiasis.
"
"
"
"Treatment for candidiasis heavily involves improving and strengthening the immune system. In the case of diabetes, there is also an acute need to regulate the condition's complications and control hyperadrenocorticism. If the dog has any indwelling catheters, these must be removed. Medications that are typically used to treat candidiasis are applied to the skin or otherwise affected area.
"
"After the symptoms of candidiasis have subsided, treatment should ideally be continued for two more weeks. Then, a culture of the infected areas must be re-done to determine if the animal has been cured. Because candidiasis is often caused by an underlying disease such as diabetes, it is of utmost importance that such diseases are controlled.
"
"There are currently no known preventative measures.

"Fleas and ticks are ectoparasites, meaning they are pests that live on the outside of their host. For fleas and ticks to survive, they must bite their host and then feed on the blood.
"
"These bites can directly impact your dog’s health. The saliva from a flea bite can cause severe allergies, dermatitis, anemia, itching, and infection. Tick bites can cause infection, abscesses, paralysis, and even death.
"
"These nasty parasites can also harbor and spread a variety of diseases to dogs, including:
"
"Lyme disease
"
"Anaplasmosis
"
"Bartonellosis
"
"Rocky Mountain spotted fever
"
"Tapeworms
"
"Babesiosis
"
"Some of these diseases can even spread to people, which is why it’s critical to keep fleas and ticks off your dog and out of your home.
"
"Flea and ticks are hardy and can thrive in many geographical areas. Because fleas and ticks carry diseases that can harm your dog and also spread to people, it’s important to start flea and tick prevention for your dog when they’re 8 weeks old and keep them on prevention year-round throughout your dog’s life. 
"
"There are a variety of products to help keep your dog free of parasites. These products can be in the form of pesticides, repellents, or growth inhibitors. Each tackles pests at different life stages to prevent infestations.
"
"Some products are only effective against one parasite (typically fleas). Combination flea and tick preventatives for dogs contain multiple ingredients to battle different types of pests. These prevention options may also provide additional protection against heartworms, skin and ear mites, and intestinal parasites.
"
"Before deciding on a flea and tick medication, always check with your veterinarian and make sure it’s a good fit for your dog. Review the product label and consult with your veterinarian to make sure:
"
"The product is the correct species for your pet (dog versus cat)
"
"The product is within the correct weight range for your pet
"
"The product protects against the appropriate parasites
"
"Whether the product should be given with food
"
"How often you should administer the product
"
"How long before the product starts working
"
"How soon you can bathe your pet after application
"
"Whether the product has any safety-related concerns
"
"You know what to do in the case of an adverse reaction
"
"Here are some other factors to consider:
"
"Flea and tick preventatives commonly come in two forms:
"
"Oral: chewable tablet that your dog ingests
"
"Topical: liquid that’s applied between the should blades or down the back of your dog
"
"Topical flea and tick preventatives are a great option for pets that are picky eaters or have sensitive stomachs. However, if you have small children or other animals, you need to be careful that they don’t touch or lick the product before it has time to dry. Topical treatments are also not a great option for dogs that like to swim a lot or dogs that need frequent baths, as water can affect the product’s efficacy.
"
"Oral treatments can be an easy and convenient option for dog parents because they can be given like a treat. If you use oral treatments, it’s best to monitor your dog to make sure they have eaten the entire tablet and do not throw it up before it can be absorbed into their system.
"
"Different geographic locations have different local parasite populations, including fleas and ticks.
"
"The Companion Animal Parasite Council is a helpful resource to identify the parasites in your area so you can make sure whichever flea and tick product you choose keeps your dog fully protected.

"Consider the types of outdoor areas where your dog spends time. Dog parks, hiking trails, wooded areas, parks, bushes, and backyards can all be homes to fleas and ticks. If your dog spends a lot of time in wooded areas or spaces where other animals and dogs spend a lot of time, their risk of exposure to parasites is higher.
"
"Even if your dog doesn’t spend a lot of time outside, fleas can easily come in through window screens, on other pets that go outside, or even on a person’s pants and shoes. Veterinarians  recommend flea and tick prevention regardless of how much time a dog spends outdoors.
"
"Some breeds (such as Collies, Australian Shepherds, and Shetland Sheepdogs) have a gene mutation called MDR-1 that makes it harder for them to break down certain types of medications.
"
"Many veterinarians recommend testing dogs for the MDR-1 gene, especially affected breeds. That said, many manufacturers of parasite preventatives have tested their products for safety on dogs with the MDR1 mutation and found they had no adverse effects.
"
"While no breed is more at risk of acquiring fleas or ticks than others, some dogs may be at higher risk due to their personality and breed characteristics. Working, herding, and hunting dogs may spend most of their day in the field, while other dogs are content to stay at home, only venturing outside occasionally.
"
"If your dog is still a puppy or is a small dog breed, you will need to consult your veterinarian to find an appropriate product for their weight or age. Most flea and tick preventatives have a minimum age of 6 to 8 weeks, but always check the package insert for confirmation.
"
"Some classes of preventatives, called isoxazolines, should be used with extreme caution in dogs with a history of seizures or neurologic disease, as these medications may make it easier for those particular dogs to have a breakthrough seizure.
"
"No preventative should be used without thorough discussion with your veterinarian if:
"
"Your dog has previously had an allergic reaction to the medication
"
"Your dog is sick and/or underweight
"
"Your dog is pregnant, nursing, or will be used for breeding in the future
"
"Some flea and tick preventatives require a prescription, while others are available over the counter.
"
"Over-the-counter (OTC) flea and tick preventatives do not require a relationship with or prescription from a veterinarian. They are typically available for purchase online and in many retail pet stores.
"
"If you decide to use an OTC flea and tick preventative, always check in with your veterinarian to make sure it is a safe option for your pet.
"
"Prescription flea and tick preventatives require a prescription from your veterinarian, and they typically cost a little more than OTC options. Most veterinarians recommend prescription products, as they are typically more effective and safer for your dog.

"Heartworm prevention is an important part of keeping your dog healthy. Heartworms are parasites that infest your dog’s heart and the vessels connected to the heart. They are typically spread from dog to dog by mosquitoes. In advanced stages, heartworms can become so large and numerous that they interfere with the heart’s ability to pump blood. This can cause heart failure.  
"
"Fortunately, there are many safe and effective options to prevent heartworm disease. Many of these medications are combined with other preventatives to address a range of parasites, including different types of intestinal worms and fleas and ticks. When choosing a heartworm medication, it’s always a good idea to consult with your veterinarian about your dog’s needs.

"Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital defect of the heart that involves four abnormalities: ventricular septal defect (a hole between the two ventricles), pulmonic stenosis (obstruction of blood flow through the pulmonary valve), an overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the heart muscle).
"
"Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital disease that likely is influenced by genetic factors. Keeshonds and English bulldogs are predisposed.
"
"Your veterinarian will start with a physical examination on your dog, which may reveal a heart murmur. Routine blood testing may be recommended. Your veterinarian will likely want to take radiographs (X-rays) of the heart and an ultrasonic study of the heart (known as an echocardiogram) will probably be necessary as well. Other testing that may be pursued include an electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry (measurement of hemoglobin saturation), and/or angiocardiography.
"
"
"
"Exercise restriction is important when dealing with dogs with Tetralogy of Fallot in order to reduce the strain on the heart. Periodic phlebotomy may be necessary to maintain an appropriate packed cell volume. Palliative surgical procedures have been advocated to improve blood flow. Medications such as propanolol may be beneficial in controlling symptoms associated with this defect.

"Tetanus in dogs is caused by a toxin produced by a bacteria called Clostridium tetani. This toxin targets the central nervous system (such as the nerves, spinal cord, and brain) and causes muscle spasms and hyperactive behavior. 
"
"Dogs exposed to the bacteria through an open wound produce the toxin, usually through a deep puncture wound. Tetanus spores are widespread in the environment and can survive for months or even years in soil. These spores do not cause a problem if they are eaten or land on the skin. Instead, they cause infection when they bury themselves deep in the body where there is not enough oxygen. This is when they are able to “wake up” and start producing the toxin. 
"
"This poison, called tetanospasmin, will find the central nervous system, usually, a nerve near the site of the injury. From there, it travels up the nerve, reaching the spinal cord and eventually the brain. Symptoms are possible anywhere the toxin is present as it travels through the dog’s body. Typically, signs of the disease start within 5-10 days of the wound occurring, but signs can show up as early as 3 days after exposure or as late as 3 weeks after the poison enters the system. 
"
"There are two forms of tetanus in dogs: the localized form (which is the most common) and the generalized form.  
"
"In the localized form of the disease, signs develop primarily in the area closest to the wound. The muscles may become tight, stiff, and tremors may develop. Sometimes an entire leg may be affected. The localized form of the disease may sometimes become a generalized form of the disease. 
"
"The temporomandibular joint is the jaw joint, the hinged point in the jaw that is formed by two bones, named the temporal and mandible bones. The temporomandibular joint is also frequently referred to as simply TMJ.
"
"There are two temporomandibular joints, one on each side of the face, each one working in concert with the other. TMJ plays a pivotal role in the normal chewing process, and is in fact essential for proper chewing, so that and any disease of this joint compromises the ability to make normal mouth movements and chew food. An affected animal will feel pain when closing or opening the mouth, or both. Diseases and disorders of the TMJ are referred to as temporomandibular joint disorders.
"
"Though these disorders can occur in any dog breed, certain breeds like basset hounds are more predisposed to TMJ disorders. Open-mouth mandibular locking has been reported in Irish setters and basset hounds.
"
"Most of these animals are presented to their veterinarian's with the complaint that they are unable to eat normally. You will need to begin by giving a thorough history of your dog’s health, including a background history of symptoms, when the problems first appeared, and whether there have been any previous traumas or injuries involving the mouth or head.
"
"After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your dog, examining the mouth, bones and the joints in the mouth. Laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis.  The results of these tests are often found to be normal, especially if no other concurrent disease is present. 
"
"X-rays remain a valuable tool in the diagnosis of TMJ disorders, and your doctor will be likely to use this type of imaging to get a better view of the bones and joints in the face. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as well, and can give a better, more detailed view that standard X-ray. If your veterinarian has an MRI machine in the clinic, this may be the recommended image technique. If something more severe is suspected, such as infection or tumor, your veterinarian may also take a small sample from the muscle tissue of the jaw so that other diseases that can cause similar symptoms can either be confirmed or ruled out.
"
"
"
"Treatment for TMJ disorders is two-fold and is aimed at eliminating or altering the underlying cause as well as treating the symptoms. In case of complete dislocation of the TMJ, your veterinarian will try to repair it by placing an object at a specific site close to the joint, and gently closing the mouth with a push in order to reduce the dislocation. If this method does not work well or the problem becomes chronic, surgery may be required to correct the defect. Pain killers will also be given to reduce the pain related these disorders. Muscle relaxing drugs can also be prescribed, if need be, to reduce the muscle tension created as a result of the TMJ disorder.
"
"After surgery, your dog may feel sore and will need proper rest in a quiet place, away from other pets and active children. You might consider cage rest for a short time, until your pet can safely move about again without overexertion. Your veterinarian will also prescribe a short course of pain killers until your pet has fully recovered, along with a mild course of antibiotics, to prevent any opportunistic bacteria from attacking your pet. Medications will need to be given precisely as directed, at the proper dosage and frequency. Keep in mind that over dosage of pain medication is one of the most preventable causes for death in household animals.
"
"This condition can be very painful, and regular pain relieving drugs may be required until the symptoms have resolved completely. Your veterinarian may also use a feeding tube to give your dog its required nutrients, especially if your dog is unable to take enough food through its mouth alone. Your veterinarian will also brief you on the correct use of the feeding tube at home so that you can take your dog home to recover in relative comfort and quiet.

"
"The generalized form of the disease is more severe and affects widespread areas of the body.  These animals may walk in a very stiff fashion, with their tail held straight up or straight out behind them, or if the muscles are so stiff they cannot bend their legs, they will stand with all four legs rigidly extended. This is called the “sawhorse” stance. 
"
"Sometimes the area around the face and head is most severely affected, with the animal holding their lips back in a “sinister smile” and the jaws held tightly closed. Because of this, tetanus is often called lockjaw. Affected animals may be unable to swallow, leading to trouble eating or drinking, along with excessive drooling. If the muscle spasms affect the throat or the muscles that control breathing, respiratory distress can result. Because so many muscles are contracting and generating heat, these dogs may develop a fever. 
"
"In most cases, veterinarians can diagnose tetanus based on physical exam findings. This is a much simpler process if there is a wound present to support the suspected diagnosis. Although there are tests that are available to test for the toxin or C. tetani bacteria, these tests can be unreliable and are generally not recommended. 
"
"Your veterinarian may also perform some basic screening tests to look for additional potential issues, including bloodwork, a urinalysis, and x-rays. Depending on the situation, other tests may be recommended. 
"
"If the disease is caught early an antitoxin treatment may reduce its severity. However, once the poison has attached to the nerve cells, the antitoxin is no longer effective and may cause more side effects than benefits.   
"
"For most animals, antibiotics are appropriate. Antibiotics do not directly affect the toxin, but if the underlying bacteria can be killed, it will stop the release of additional toxin into the dog’s system. This reduces the severity of the disease and allows the body to fight the remaining toxins. 
"
"If your vet finds a wound, they will likely want to surgically debride the wound, or clean it out. This includes removing all tissue in and around the wound to remove as much C. tetani bacteria as possible, which reduces the amount of toxin being produced. 
"
"Dogs with tetanus require very intensive medical care. Often, they are placed on intravenous fluids (IV) and medications for extended periods of time. Post-surgery, if they are unable to eat on their own, they may require a feeding tube. Most dogs require a significant amount of nursing care in a quiet, dark environment that reduces stimulations which may trigger muscle spasms. Medications can be used to try and reduce these spasms, but these have potential side effects and will need to be used with caution. 
"
"Dogs with the localized form of tetanus typically recover with time and early treatment, but it could take a month or more for all signs to resolve. For dogs that are more severely affected, or that have the generalized form of the disease, the prognosis is much worse, with survival rates as low as 50%. The quicker the diagnosis and the more aggressive the supportive care, the better the prognosis. 
"
"The best way to prevent tetanus in dogs is to monitor your dog for any fresh wounds and seek appropriate care immediately. Proper cleaning of the wound (often under sedation if the wound is deep) is important to remove any bacteria. Following up with antibiotics for these deep wounds is also critical. If your dog develops any signs consistent with tetanus, reporting these immediately to your veterinarian is key. Rapid, appropriate treatment is lifesaving in cases of tetanus. 
"
"Tetanus is very rare in dogs, but if not quickly diagnosed and aggressively treated, tetanus can kill dogs.
"
"No, tetanus is caused by the toxin from a bacteria that has entered the dog’s body through a wound. This particular bacteria is not transmissible from the affected dog to other pets.
"
"No, the toxin that causes tetanus in dogs comes from a bacteria which has entered the dog through a wound. This bacteria will not transmit to humans from an infected dog—although humans can also get tetanus through deep puncture wounds and infection by the same bacteria.
"
"Tetanus is so rare in dogs that vaccinations against tetanus are not generally recommended and there is no commercial vaccine for tetanus.

"A dog's heart is divided into four chambers. The two upper chambers are the atria (singular: atrium), and lower chambers are the ventricles. In atrial wall tear, the wall of the atrium is ruptured. This typically occurs secondary to blunt trauma, but may be due to some other cause. As with other wounds, the protective mechanisms of the body take over and heal the tear, with resulting scar formation, but if the tear is significant, heavy bleeding can lead to sudden death. A major tear, at the least, can cause serious illness. Trauma of this type may occur in dogs of any breed, age, size, or gender.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination on your dog, into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Complete blood tests, with a biochemical profile, complete blood count and a urinalysis will be performed. However, these tests may not reveal much information for the diagnosis of this disease. For confirmation of an injury to the atrial wall, your veterinarian will use specific diagnostic procedures and tests. X-rays, ECGs, echocardiography, color Doppler studies, and other such techniques will reveal structural and functional abnormalities pertaining to the heart. Any defect in the atrial wall, or scar formation indicating a past injury may be visible using some of these techniques.
"
"  
"
"
"
"Treatment will be directed toward overcoming any complications resulting from the atrial tear. If scar tissue has formed at the site of tear, your dog may stabilize but the possibiltiy of future complications will continue to be an issue. Surgery to correct the defect may be advised for some patients, but the outcome is, unfortunately, not always rewarding. Strict cage rest will be advised for such patients to encourage healing avoid further complications.
"
"Unfortunately, long-term survival is very low for these patients, even if the tear has sealed through scar formation. However, if your dog has showed significant improvement  your veterinarian may only schedule regular visits for progress evaluations. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines regarding cage rest, diet, and other management issues.

"Amino acids are the basic building blocks of protein. There are 22 amino acids that are needed for proper functioning of the body.
"
"In dogs, 12 of these amino acids are “nonessential,” meaning the body can make them on its own. The other 10 amino acids are “essential,” meaning they must be supplied by the diet.
"
"Taurine is known to be a dietary requirement for cats and may be for some dog breeds as well.
"
"Here’s what you need to know about the amount of taurine in dog food, the risk of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) from taurine deficiency, and whether you should consider taurine supplements for dogs. 
"
"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (commonly known as SLE), also known as lupus, is a chronic autoimmune condition that occurs when your dog’s immune system attacks his internal organs. Lupus in dogs is relatively rare and can affect more than one organ.  
"
"Every tissue in the body has substances called antigens that can trigger the immune system to react. If the immune system reacts to the antigens, special proteins called antibodies are produced. Antibodies are immune system cells that are programmed to attack invaders. In a dog with lupus, the antibodies attack the dog’s own tissues and organs. Systemic lupus erythematosus in dogs may affect any organ, but it most commonly affects the liver and kidney. 
"
"Muscle pain and/or weakness are common symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus in dogs. Other symptoms may include:  
"
"Arthritis (in several joints) 
"
"Skin rashes or sores (lesions) 
"
"Fever  
"
"Lethargy 
"
"Loss of appetite  
"
"Swollen lymph nodes 
"
"Seizures or tremors 
"
"Because systemic lupus erythematosus can affect one or several organs, a dog may also experience vomiting, increased water intake, and increased urination.  
"
"Dogs with systemic lupus erythematosus can also develop anemia, a severe condition that occurs when a dog has a low red blood cell count. Symptoms of anemia include pale gums, severe weakness, and lethargy.  
"
"There is no known cause for systemic lupus erythematosus in dogs. It is unclear why a dog’s immune system develops the antibodies that attack body tissue and organs.  
"
"Since taurine is known to be ‘essential’ for cats, cat food must have taurine supplemented in quantities established by the American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and the National Research Council (NRC).
"
"To date, however, there are no stated requirements for supplementing dog food with taurine. The extent to which dogs may require dietary taurine is still under investigation and may be breed dependent.
"
"Taurine deficiency is one cause of a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), where the heart muscle thins and the chambers become enlarged. This is true for cats, and may now also be true for dogs.
"
"Recently, studies have found a connection between DCM and these breeds of dogs:
"
"Golden Retrievers
"
"Cocker Spaniels
"
"Newfoundlands
"
"Saint Bernards
"
"English Setters
"
"Irish Wolfhounds
"
"Portuguese Water Dogs
"
"While research is ongoing, there are theories that the onset of DCM is related to the diet, specifically, grain-free diets. However, the question remains whether the DCM occurs due to an overall lack of taurine in the dog food or other dietary factors that cause problems with taurine digestion, absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion.
"
"Veterinarians would first need a thorough history of your dog's health, including a list of symptoms and the diet fed.
"
"Then, your veterinarian would conduct a complete physical examination of your dog and do routine blood work, including:
"
"Complete blood count (CBC)
"
"Biochemical profile (chemistry panel)
"
"Urinalysis
"
"Blood concentrations of taurine can be measured by a laboratory to determine whether deficiency is likely. There are “normal” ranges for blood-taurine concentrations in dogs, so if the measured concentration is lower than that range, taurine deficiency is probable.
"
"Taurine is distributed throughout the body with high concentration in certain tissues, including the heart, the retina of the eye, and the brain. Taurine deficiency may be suspected if heart disease, retinal disease, and/or cystinuria are identified via the physical exam and/or initial laboratory results.
"
"If heart disease is suspected based on physical exam and/or blood work (e.g., low blood taurine), then chest X-rays, electrocardiogram (ECG), and other diagnostic measures would be recommended in order to evaluate and diagnose the severity of the disease.
"
"Likewise, blood-taurine concentrations should be evaluated if retinal damage (problems with your dog’s eyes) is found during a physical exam by your veterinarian.
"
"If cysteine stones/crystals are found in the urinalysis, it is likely your dog has an issue metabolizing amino acids.
"
"Cystinuria is more common in certain breeds, such as the following:
"
"Newfoundlands
"
"Scottish Terriers
"
"Basenjis
"
"Basset Hounds
"
"Systemic lupus erythematosus can develop in any breed, but is most commonly seen in German Shepherds, Beagles, Afghan Hounds, Collies, Poodles, and Irish Setters. Since some dog breeds are predisposed to the disease, veterinarians believe genetics may play a role.  
"
"Dogs are generally diagnosed when they are young or middle-age, so aging is not considered a risk factor. 
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete examination and review your dog’s health history. This will include reviewing symptoms, behavior, and any changes in habits. 
"
"Your veterinarian will also perform tests to determine the cause of your dog’s symptoms. Those tests may include: 
"
"X-ray: The veterinarian may x-ray parts of your dog’s body to determine the health of organs such as the kidneys and liver.  
"
"Blood chemistry test: Your veterinarian will check for antibodies that are attacking the body’s tissues and review liver and kidney function. 
"
"Urinalysis: This test can screen for protein loss and kidney function.  
"
"Ultrasound: A test that allows your vet to see pictures of the dog’s organs. 
"
"Biopsy of skin lesions: A test that involves studying small samples of skin to look for abnormalities. 
"
"Cytology: Your veterinarian may collect a small sample of fluid from a swollen joint to examine under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis. 
"
"Your veterinarian will develop a treatment plan to minimize pain and other symptoms, depending on your pet’s diagnosis. Treatment may include prescription medication to reduce inflammation and medicine to suppress your dog’s immune system. These types of medications can lessen the body’s production of the antibodies. 
"
"Dogs experiencing kidney failure may also require hospitalization to receive fluids. If your dog has anemia, a blood transfusion might be required. Your veterinarian may also prescribe medication to manage nausea, vomiting, or anorexia, if those are present.  
"
"There is no way to prevent systemic lupus erythematosus, but your veterinarian can prescribe medicine to manage symptoms throughout your dog’s life. 
"
"Your dog will also require routine visits to the veterinarian to monitor any disease progression, tolerance of medications, and minimize symptoms.
"
"Yes. Systemic lupus erythematosus in dogs is often painful because the disease can affect the blood, organs, or joints. Medications can help to minimize pain.
"
"This depends on the severity of the disease and the number of organs affected. The risk of complications in dogs with systemic lupus erythematosus increases with age because damage from the disease can cause organ failure.
"
"No. However your veterinarian can tailor a treatment plan based on your dog’s health to maximize your dog’s quality of life and manage symptoms.

"However, if present in any dog, it may indicate amino acid malabsorption, which can potentially be causing taurine deficiency.
"
"Taurine supplementation is the treatment of choice for dogs suffering from taurine deficiency. The length of time that your dog will need taurine supplementation will depend on the severity of the deficiency and your dog's ability to maintain levels of taurine as it is ingested.
"
"In some dogs, lifetime taurine supplementation may be required to prevent recurrent taurine deficiency. For other dogs, a diet change may be needed in addition to taurine supplementation, and if symptoms resolve, supplementation may be discontinued.
"
"Good nursing care is required at home during treatment of taurine deficiency.
"
"Give all medications and supplements at the prescribed or recommended dose and frequency to avoid aggravation of the symptoms.
"
"In the case of heart disease, your dog will need proper rest in a stress-free environment at home.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up examinations to monitor the treatment response in your dog. While dramatic improvement is seen in most animals, some animals may not respond completely to taurine supplementation and need further treatment.

"Testicular tumors are among the most common tumors seen in older unneutered male dogs. These dogs still have both testicles, which make sperm for reproduction and also produce male hormones such as testosterone.
"
"A tumor forms when cells grow abnormally, populating and dividing out of control, leading to an abnormal mass of tissue. The mass may grow and enlarge if not treated appropriately. Testicular tumors are not common, since many dogs are neutered at a young age.
"
"Tumors may be benign or malignant. A diagnosis of a benign tumor means that it is not cancerous and has not spread, or metastasized, outside of its original location, such as beyond the testicle. A tumor is considered malignant when it is cancerous and has spread outside of its original location, such as a mass that started growing in the testicle, but then spreads to other organs like the lungs and lymph nodes.
"
"There are three types of testicular tumors in male dogs:
"
"Seminoma—Develop from the cells that produce sperm, also known as “germ cells”
"
"Interstitial cell tumors—Develop from the cells responsible for the production of testosterone
"
"Sertoli cell tumors—Develop from sertoli cells, which nourish and support developing sperm
"
"Other forms of testicular tumors such as lipomas, fibromas, and hemangiomas can develop, but these occur rarely occur in dogs.
"
"Clinical signs of testicular tumors in dogs are not always obvious and can vary depending on the tumor type and location. Testicles are difficult to see in dogs with longer coats, since the hair may hide subtle changes. Testicular tumors are often found while palpating or feeling the testicles for anything unusual during a physical exam.
"
"Signs may include:
"
"One or multiple enlarged nodules seen or palpated in the affected testicle(s)
"
"Uneven testicular size
"
"Scrotal swelling (sac of skin housing the testicles)
"
"Enlarged mammary glands and nipples
"
"Sagging prepuce (sheath of penis) 
"
"Hair loss and darkening of the skin
"
"Squatting to urinate (like a female dog)
"
"Infertility in a breeding male
"
"Sexual attraction of other male dogs due to increased estrogen levels
"
"If the tumor is cancerous and has spread beyond the testicle, you may see:
"
"Lethargy (tiredness beyond the normal level)
"
"Weight loss
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Labored or difficulty breathing
"
"Coughing
"
"Difficulty urinating and/or defecating due to enlarged lymph nodes or prostate gland narrowing or blocking these passages
"
"Normal testicles are egg-shaped and housed within the scrotum, which is located between the upper thighs and behind the penis. One testicle may be slightly higher than the other.
"
"Changes to the testicles and/or scrotum that may indicate a tumor include:
"
"Soft or firm swelling affecting one or both testicles
"
"Enlarged scrotum
"
"One testicle larger than the other
"
"Asymmetry of the testicles
"
"Irregular, lumpy, or bumpy testicles
"
"Painful testicle(s)
"
"While it is unclear why one dog may develop a testicular tumor over another, certain environmental, genetic, and breed predispositions may be risk factors.
"
"Age is also a risk factor. While unneutered dogs of any age and breed can have testicular tumors, they occur most commonly in those over 10 years old. They are also common in breeds such as German Shepherd, Afghan Hound, Boxer, Weimaraner, and Collie.
"
"A testicular tumor may be found incidentally during a physical examination. Your veterinarian may feel an abnormal nodule or consistency that differs from normal testicular tissue, or they may discover that your dog only has one testicle instead of two. One testicle in male dogs is common is known as cryptorchidism, and it occurs in approximately 13% of male dogs.
"
"If your dog is showing signs of illness and your veterinarian suspects a tumor, chest or abdominal x-rays, or an abdominal and scrotal/testicular ultrasound may be recommended to look for a mass. Bloodwork, urinalysis, and a rectal exam may also be necessary to find any potential abnormalities.
"
"The tumor type is diagnosed after surgery, when a sample of the abnormal tissue is sent to a veterinary pathologist for examination in a laboratory. This is important in diagnosing what type of tumor is present and whether it is benign or malignant.
"
"If your dog is used for breeding, your veterinarian may opt to take a small biopsy of the abnormal tissue or a fine needle aspirate (a sample of tissue with a small needle) instead of neuter surgery to determine the type of tumor. 
"
"Surgical removal of the testicles is the treatment of choice for dogs with testicular tumors. If the tumor is cancerous and has spread beyond the testicles, therapies such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used to target and stop the advancement of cancer.
"
"Complicating factors such as significant underlying disease, a heart murmur, respiratory issues, or obesity can make a dog an unsuitable candidate for anesthesia and surgery.
"
"If a tumor has been diagnosed as benign and is small and slow-growing, you may be able to monitor it until you notice negative changes such as enlargement, causing pain, breaking open and bleeding, or interfering with your dog’s ability to walk. Typically, tumors are removed long before they become uncomfortable for your dog.
"
"Testicular tumors often have a low rate of spread if they are cancerous. Surgical removal of the testicles often cures the issue. 
"
"Sertoli cell tumors and seminomas have less than a 15% chance of metastasizing, while interstitial cell tumors are usually benign and rarely spread beyond the testicles. Cancer originating in the urinary tract or other parts of the reproductive tract may spread to the testicles, so in these cases it is often necessary to search for spread in other tissues and organs. Tumors that have spread can leave a guarded prognosis for your dog, but this depends on the type of tumor, its location, and options for treatment.
"
"After surgery, your dog may need to wear an Elizabethan collar (E-collar) to prevent licking and chewing of the surgical site. If your dog bothers his surgical incision, it may lead to an infection or the stitches popping open.
"
"Recovery time is similar to a regular neuter surgery, where your dog should be kept in a calm and quiet environment with limited activity for 10-14 days. This means no running, jumping, or roughhousing. If your dog is normally active, he may need to be confined to a small room or crate to help him remain quiet and heal from surgery.
"
"You should carefully inspect the surgery site every day, noting any redness, swelling, heat, discharge, or foul odor that may indicate an infection. Keep the incision clean and dry—this means no bathing or swimming until your veterinarian confirms that your dog has completely healed from surgery. Your veterinarian may request follow-up appointments if your dog’s tumor was diagnosed as cancer to monitor for any reoccurrence of the disease.
"
"The best way to prevent testicular tumors in your male dog is to have them examined by a veterinarian and neutered at an early age. Depending on your veterinarian’s recommendations and the breed of your dog, male dogs can be neutered as early as two months of age. Larger breeds may benefit from delayed neutering until they stop growing (9-15 months of age) to help prevent the development of certain cancers and joint issues later in life.
"
"Testicular tumors in dogs may not be painful—which means your dog may not show any signs that something is wrong. However, swelling and pressure from a growing tumor may cause signs of pain.
"
"Testicular tumors are the most common tumor found in older, unneutered male dogs, although all breeds and ages can be affected. The good news is that it’s not widespread, as many dogs have already been neutered.

"Also known as Caudal Occipital Malformation Syndrome (COMS) or occipital hypoplasia, Chiari-like Malformation in dogs is a relatively uncommon though debilitating neurologic condition where abnormal sensation, pain, and progressive weakness develops.
"
"Simply stated, the dog's brain doesn't fit properly within its skull, and part of it, usually the brain stem, becomes crowded, obstructing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid which bathes the brain and spinal cord, responsible for providing nutrition, waste removal, and shock absorption).
"
"Syringomyelia, or fluid pockets within the spinal cord, can subsequently occur. This is when cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid that bathes the brain and the spinal cord, is distributed unevenly throughout the spinal cord. Chiari-Like Malformation is just one of the few causes of syringomyelia, as tumors and trauma have also been associated with the condition. 
"
"The primary sign of this condition is scratching, mainly at or around the neck, head, chest or shoulders. This type of scratching is unusual because it often occurs when dog is mobile, it may not actually make skin contact when scratching, and seems to only be ""itchy"" on one side of the neck. Dogs will also exhibit pain at these areas when touched or petted, or when a collar or leash is applied, and the pain can be intermittent. Dogs can also experience the following symptoms:
"
"Restricted or stiff postures
"
"Abnormal head carriage (head may appear bowed or bent)
"
"Synechiae are adhesions between the iris and other structures in the eye. They are the result of inflammation in the iris and are particularly common with anterior uveitis (inflammation of the dark tissues of the eye) and trauma to the eye.
"
"Synechiae can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of eye problem affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"Synechiae may be anterior or posterior.
"
"Symptoms seen with synechiae include:
"
"Diagnosis is based on an ophthalmic examination, which involves examining the structures of the eye. In addition, dyes may be used on the cornea to detect corneal injuries. Tonometry may be performed to measure the intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball.)
"
"
"
"In many cases, no treatment is necessary. If an underlying cause is diagnosed, it should be treated appropriately. In cases where glaucoma is present, laser surgery to repair the synechiae may be attempted.

"Fox Terrier
"

"
"Maltese

"
"Pekingese
"

"

"
"Samoyed
"
"Yorkshire Terrier
"
"Because this condition is genetic, symptoms are more often seen in younger dogs.
"
"MRI is the diagnostic tool of choice. Unfortunately, other than MRI, a screening tool does not yet exist, and because of its cost and procedural difficulties (it requires anesthesia), an MRI may not be feasible for every pet parent or patient. 
"
"In addition to the history provided and symptoms, your veterinarian will start with a physical exam, paying particular attention to the dog's nervous system, and may recommend a series of screening tests, such as blood work and urinalysis. They can be helpful in eliminating other causes such as osteoarthritis, allergies, and ear infections, to name a few, but will also help guide future anesthetic recommendations.  X-rays, though limited, can also be helpful in ruling out other harmful conditions.  
"
"Management of this condition is relatively straightforward with goals to eliminate pain, decrease secondary swelling and inflammation, and decrease the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure.
"
"Drugs like gabapentin, amitriptyline, or amantadine can help decrease neuropathic pain (abnormal painful response or stimuli, associated with neurologic disease), and NSAIDs or steroids can alleviate swelling and inflammation. Diuretics like furosemide or omeprazole, an antacid, can decrease the production of CSF.  Veterinary acupuncture can also be an option.
"
"Even with surgery, where a piece of the skull or vertebrae is removed to decrease pressure, a cure may not be achieved. Surgery has an 80% reported success rate of improving symptoms, but those symptoms can reoccur later and still require medical management. Unfortunately, for dogs with severe symptoms and/or refractory pain, humane euthanasia may be recommended. 
"
"The prognosis for dogs suffering from these conditions varies. Some dogs may have little pain and can manage well with medication alone, but those suffering from extreme pain or neurologic issues have a much more guarded prognosis. 
"
"Patients that have had surgery can expect a multi-week recovery process with gradual reintroduction to exercise and future follow-up appointments. If your dog is prescribed medication, chances are they will be on those for a long time, if not for life, so do not stop them unless told to do so by your veterinarian. 
"
"Due to the nature of these medications, future follow-ups with drug monitoring and blood work will be needed. Additionally, keeping the food and water bowls elevated and using a harness instead of a collar and leash will be helpful to minimize any further discomfort and pain, as will avoiding rough play and trauma.
"
"It is important to work with your veterinarian to help manage your dog's condition and ensure the best outcome possible, as his pain and symptoms may worsen over time, requiring additional follow-ups or testing.

"Syncope is the medical term for fainting, which can occur both in dogs (and cats), due to a lack of oxygen or nutrients to the brain. Syncope in dogs is considered a medical emergency—immediate treatment is urgent and critical.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The most obvious symptom is acute collapse of your dog, often with stiff limbs and body. Your dog may lean or stagger at first and then fall to one side. Urination and (rarely) defecation may occur concurrently with the fall. Other symptoms, which are also useful in arriving at a diagnosis, may include an underlying heart murmur or arrhythmia. 
"
"Not all dogs that suffer from this condition will require treatment, but all are usually put through a series of tests to arrive at a diagnosis. Syncope is considered to be more of a clinical sign than a disease, and occurs when there is a sudden loss of consciousness associated with the collapse of the dog. It is temporary, and dogs usually recover after only a few seconds to minutes.
"
"It can be very challenging to differentiate a seizing dog from one that has only fainted. Even trained personnel can have difficulty distinguishing the two, and a video recording of the event can certainly be helpful in narrowing down the possibilities. You will probably be asked by the veterinary staff to describe the event in as much detail as possible, including any events leading up to the episode and afterward.

"The drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, has called attention to lead poisoning in pets, a medical condition that veterinarians rarely see.
"
"In Flint, a number of dogs tested positive in 2016 for lead exposure. Michigan State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine led a volunteer effort that involved screening 300 dogs for lead in the areas hardest hit by the water crisis. One of the more seriously affected dogs required treatment. Many others were found to have higher than normal levels of lead in their blood.
"
"Though it is concerning, the situation in Flint is an anomaly, veterinarians say. Lead poisoning in dogs and cats is extremely uncommon, particularly when it’s caused by water.
"
"In 2015, the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center saw just 65 cases of lead poisoning out of a total of 181,000 cases of animal poisonings, said Dr. Tina Wismer, a veterinary toxicologist and the center’s medical director.
"
"“The incidence of lead poisoning is relatively low in pets, especially cats and dogs,” Wismer says. “The most common situation where we see pets exposed to lead occurs when people are remodeling their house.”
"
"While lead-based paints have been banned for use in American homes for decades, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that all houses built before 1978 are likely to contain some lead-based paint.
"
"Old lead paint does not become dangerous until it’s disturbed. Sanding painted surfaces can release paint dust that’s toxic to animals and humans.
"
"“Not only do the animals inhale it but they walk across it and lick it off their paws and fur,” Wismer says.
"
"In addition to water and paint, animals can come into contact with lead if they chew on or swallow a fishing sinker, battery, golf ball, bullet, or other object containing lead, says Dr. Justine Lee, who specializes in emergency critical care and toxicology in St. Paul, Minnesota.
"
"“It’s more common in dogs than cats,” Lee says. Cats “won’t lick a painted wall. They’re more fastidious than dogs.”
"
"Recognizing lead poisoning can be tricky since the symptoms can vary. A pup that ingests lead paint by chewing on the woodwork in an old house can experience extreme stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, Wismer says. Pets that are exposed to lead for a longer period of time may exhibit neurological symptoms such as seizures or a wobbly gait. Other signs of lead poisoning can include fatigue, poor appetite, extreme anxiety, blindness, crying, and changes in behavior.
"
"While the symptoms are similar for both species, the incidence of seizures tends to be higher in cats, Wismer says.
"
"The following often occurs with syncopal episodes:
"
"The episode itself lasts for a short duration.
"
"It is usually preceded by an event, such as coughing or some sort of excitement.
"
"Most often the dog has a rapid recovery.
"
"The dog may have an underlying disease such as a heart murmur or arrythmia.
"
"A seizure occurs due to abnormal brain activity; it is the sudden, uncontrollable, and uncoordinated movement of the body. Dogs typically are witnessed with:
"
"Pre-ictal phase, noticed as pacing, whining, or generally acting “weird”
"
"Twitching movements, especially of the face
"
"A longer time to recover, followed by disorientation or weakness
"
"Defecation, urination, and even salivation, possibly simultaneously
"
"An neurologic condition or neurologic deficits after the seizure
"
"Multiple conditions and underlying diseases can cause fainting in dogs:
"
"Cardiovascular conditions including arrhythmias, heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), mitral valve disease, pericardial effusion, pulmonary hypertension, and congenital heart defects. Other conditions such as cancer or diseases that affect blood output (e.g., heartworm disease) can have similar effects.
"
"Neurologic conditions including brain tumors, vascular disease, and narcolepsy
"
"Acute hemorrhage (blood loss) or profound anemia (low red blood cell count)
"
"Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)­ or electrolyte abnormalities
"
"Adverse or known drug side effects, from drugs such as vasodilators or beta blockers
"
"Situational syncope, often due to a sudden change in pressure within the body from an event such as coughing, vomiting, urination, or defecation. Pulling tightly on a dog’s collar or leash can have similar effects, though due to a different mechanism.
"
"Vasovagal syncope, due to a sudden drop in blood pressure often preceded by some sort of stressful or emotional situation that causes a change in body reflexes
"
"Your dog’s clinical history and physical exam can often not only facilitate a diagnosis of syncope but also provide insight into an underlying cause as well as a way forward for possible treatment options. It’s always helpful if you can provide a detailed account of the event itself, as well as what occurred before and after the event.
"
"Bloodwork and urine testing will most likely be recommended, as well as a heart work-up including chest X-rays, EKG (a 24-hour Holter monitor may be needed for the diagnosis of arrhythmias), blood pressure, and echocardiogram. Referral to a veterinary cardiologist or neurologist to consider neurologic conditions with a test such as CT, MRI, or CSF tap may also be discussed and recommended.
"
"The prognosis is variable and often related to the underlying cause. For dogs suffering from situational syncope, limiting or preventing provoking situations is key. For instance, if syncopal events occur every time your dog becomes excited when the doorbell rings, then disconnecting the doorbell or installing another system may be the appropriate fix. Switching to a harness instead of a collar or leash is also advisable.
"
"Treatment for dogs suffering from a heart condition will also vary. Arrhythmias or heart failure will often benefit from medications such as sotalol, an anti-arrhythmic, or enalapril, which helps regulate blood pressure. Surgical procedures may be warranted for dogs requiring a pacemaker or in cases of a blockage or tumor, or when needed to resolve pericardial effusion. Chemotherapy or radiation may be necessary to treat cancer.
"
"Dogs showing electrolyte abnormalities or low blood sugar may require IV fluids and supplementation. Blood loss will require a transfusion. Discontinuing medications that could be causing a condition may also be recommended. 
"
"Lead poisoning is a serious condition that cannot be treated at home. If you think your pet may have it, take her to a veterinarian immediately, Lee says. The key to recovery is early treatment.
"
"“It is treatable but it must be identified right away,” Lee says. “Thankfully, it’s super easy to test for.”
"
"A blood test is used to confirm the presence of lead, she says. X-rays can reveal paint chips or other lead objects in your pet’s body.
"
"An endoscopy may be performed to eliminate a leaded object. The doctor would anesthetize your pet and remove the object by sliding a camera into the animal’s stomach, Lee says.
"
"If the object has passed out of the stomach, surgery may be required.
"
"More advanced cases of lead poisoning require chelation treatment. Approved for use in humans, chelaters are medicines that veterinarians prescribe off-label to remove lead from pets.
"
"“Chelation pulls the lead out of the blood or bone and it’s excreted through the kidneys,” Wismer explains.
"
"Your veterinarian may prescribe an oral medication for you to give your pet at home, or recommend treatment in a hospital. Pets who receive chelation injections in the hospital get intravenous fluids at the same time to mitigate the risk of kidney damage that can occur with this type of treatment, Wismer says.
"
"“They are quite effective,” she says. “We’ve used these medicines for years.”
"
"Recovery depends on how much lead the animal has ingested. Your veterinarian will recheck your pet’s blood after one to two weeks of treatment.
"
"“If the blood lead levels are dropping and the pet is no longer having any problems, the treatment can be stopped,” Wismer says. “If the lead levels are still high, or the animal is having problems, then the treatment is continued.”
"
"In extreme cases, dogs experiencing persistent seizures have been euthanized. “It can happen, but, fortunately, it’s not very common,” Wismer says, adding that many pets recover from lead poisoning.
"
"Of course preventing lead poisoning is easier and less costly than treating it.
"
"The best thing you can do is make sure your pets are not exposed to lead. Wismer recommends lead tests, available at hardware stores. These inexpensive test kits include swabs, which you can use on painted surfaces and other areas you think may contain lead. Test results are usually delivered in seconds.
"
"Home renovations can be toxic, so keep your pets away when construction work is being done to your home, Wismer says.
"
"Give your animals bottled water to drink if you think the water from your tap may be contaminated, Lee says. And don’t offer your pets food or water in ceramic bowls that may contain lead.
"
"“Pet proof your home,” says Lee. “Make sure your dog doesn’t eat fishing lures or lead fishing sinkers.”
"
"In 20 years of practicing veterinary medicine, Lee has treated fewer than a half dozen cases of lead poisoning in pets. The condition is more common in birds of prey and waterfowl. Birds come into contact with lead through buckshot found at the bottom of lakes and ponds.
"
"“It’s super rare in dogs and cats,” Lee says.
"
"Lead poisoning is so uncommon that many veterinarians have no experience treating it. For that reason, Lee advises veterinarians and pet parents to contact the ASPCA’s Animal Poison Control Center at 888-426-4435 for advice on treatment.

"Avoiding known triggers, such as excitement caused by the mail carrier or the doorbell ringing, and limiting your dog’s physical activity are crucial. If your dog is prone to syncope, “dog-proofing” your home is advised. For instance, using gates to block access to the stairs or pool, and using corner protectors for furniture in addition to having padded surfaces like rugs or carpet, can cause less harm to your dog if they faint.
"
"If your dog is prescribed medication, chances are they will be needed for life so never stop medication suddenly or without direction from your veterinarian. It is also important to attend any future follow-up appointments, as monitoring the response to prescribed medications or periodic placement of a Holter to monitor for persistent arrhythmias will prove invaluable to a speedy recovery, resulting in better quality of life.  
"
"Typically, the dog will fall over with stiff legs and rigid body; urination and (rarely) defecation may occur at the same time as well. After a few moments, the dog will get up and continue as normal. 
"
"The first thing is to remain calm. Be sure your dog is not in danger of harming himself or you in the process. He should recover momentarily, and you should immediately seek veterinary attention.

"The lymphatic system is part of your dog’s immune system. It includes lymph nodes and a network of lymph vessels called lymphatics that run alongside your dog’s regular blood vessels. The lymph system performs several important functions in your dog’s body, including transporting white blood cells, removing waste products from tissues and cells, and helping to produce disease-fighting antibodies.  
"
"Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that contain immune cells. When your dog’s body is invaded by viruses or bacteria, or your dog has a disease that triggers an immune response, the lymph nodes become enlarged as they work to fight off the invader. Swollen lymph nodes are called lymphadenopathy or lymphadenomegaly.
"
"Your vet can tell the difference between swollen lymph nodes and regular lymph nodes by feeling the lymph nodes that are closer to the skin. Lymph nodes that can be felt through the skin are known as “palpable” nodes. These are located in a few areas:
"
"Submandibular: Just under the jaw where it meets the neck
"
"Pre-scapular: Under the submandibular lymph nodes at the front of the shoulders
"
"Axillary: In the “armpit” of the dog, or where the front legs meet the chest
"
"Inguinal: On the underside of the dog where the rear legs meet the abdomen (groin)
"
"Popliteal: Just behind the stifles (“knees”) of the rear legs
"
"During a physical exam when your veterinarian looks like she is petting your dog, she is actually feeling for abnormalities in the lymph nodes, as well as unusual lumps or bumps. Generally, the only palpable lymph nodes are the submandibular and popliteal in a healthy dog. 
"
"Swollen lymph nodes can sometimes be detected by pet parents at home. If you’re petting your dog and feel a new or unusual bump in one of the areas listed above, it may be a swollen lymph node.
"
"In most cases, there are no outward symptoms that accompany your dog’s swollen lymph nodes, particularly if they are only mildly enlarged. However, if the lymph nodes are significantly enlarged—including the nodes inside the thorax and abdomen— then you should watch for symptoms including:
"
"Vomiting
"
"Coughing
"
"Lethargy
"
"Fever
"
"Poor appetite
"
"Enlarged abdomen
"
"Lymph nodes enlarge when the immune system is activated, usually by a disease process. If just one or two lymph nodes are enlarged, this often indicates a localized disease. For example, an infected toe could result in enlarged lymph nodes that drain that area.
"
"A systemic infection in which the whole body is affected will often cause many or all of the lymph nodes to be enlarged. Examples include:
"
"Demodectic mange
"
"Puppy “strangles” (i.e., juvenile cellulitis)
"
"Tick-borne diseases (e.g., Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis)
"
"Bacterial infection (e.g., Yersinia pestis, which causes canine plague)
"
"Reactive hyperplasia (e.g., active immune response)
"
"Fungal infection (e.g., Coccidioidomycosis)
"
"Immune-mediated diseases (e.g., pemphigus)
"
"Cancer (e.g., lymphosarcoma)
"
"There aren’t specific breeds that are susceptible to swollen lymph nodes. However, some breeds are susceptible to diseases that will cause swollen lymph nodes. Other breeds are prone to developing lymphosarcoma (cancer of the lymphatic system), including Golden retrievers, Boxers, Dobermans, Rottweilers, and others.  
"
"Toy breeds (such as Yorkies, Poodles, and Dachshunds) are very susceptible to dental disease, and often have enlarged submandibular lymph nodes when they have infected teeth and gums.
"
"In most cases, your dog’s lifestyle is a better predictor of their susceptibility to certain diseases that cause enlarged lymph nodes. For example, a hunting dog or a dog that spends a lot of time in the woods is far more likely than an indoor dog to contract tick-borne diseases like Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis, as well as fungal, bacterial, or parasitic diseases that can lead to enlarged lymph nodes.
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes are usually fairly obvious on physical exam. If your vet finds swollen lymph nodes, they may collect a sample through one of these methods:   
"
"FNA: Fine needle aspirate (FNA) is a procedure in which a syringe and needle are used to collect cells that can be examined under a microscope. Your vet will examine these cells on a slide, or they might send the sample out to an external lab for analysis.   
"
"Biopsy: Your vet may decide instead to perform a biopsy under general anesthesia. In this procedure, a larger piece of the lymph tissue is removed for analysis by a histopathologist. Usually the histopathologist’s diagnosis is available in 7-10 days.
"
"Treatment of swollen lymph nodes depends on the underlying cause. Sometimes your vet may start treatment for your dog before receiving a confirmed diagnosis from histopath. This is usually done if your vet is certain of the diagnosis. Treatment might include:
"
"Antibiotics
"
"Antifungals
"
"Anti-inflammatories
"
"Steroids
"
"Surgery
"
"If cancer is confirmed, chemotherapy may be started.
"
"Recovery depends on the cause of the swollen lymph nodes. If the diagnosis is lymphosarcoma, or cancer of the lymph system, steroids and chemotherapy may be warranted. This disease will generally recur after remission. 
"
"Many tick-borne illnesses are controlled after one round of antibiotics, but it is possible that symptoms will return. It’s very important to monitor your dog for signs of recurring illness or swollen lymph nodes. Contact your vet immediately if you notice new swelling in your dog’s lymph nodes.
"
"Tick-borne diseases. Make sure that if your dog is exposed to ticks that you have them on an effective tick control product. Speak with your vet about what product is right for your dog based on their medical history.
"
"Foreign bodies such as plant awns in feet. Do not let your dog wander off-leash, especially in an area with longer grass.
"
"Fungal and bacterial diseases. Avoid letting your dog wander while unleashed. This will help minimize contact with fungal and bacterial diseases.
"
"Cancer (lymphosarcoma). Be aware of what is “normal” for your dog’s lymph node size. Report any abnormal swellings to your vet as soon as you notice them. Be extra wary if your dog is a high-risk breed such as a Golden Retriever, Boxer, Doberman, or Rottweiler.
"
"Immune-mediated diseases such as pemphigus.
"
"Swollen lymph nodes feel like grapes just under the skin surface. They can double in size overnight with diseases like lymphosarcoma.

"Gingivitis is a reversible inflammation of the gums and is considered the earliest stage of periodontal disease. In the early phases of gingivitis, some plaque is present and there is a mild redness of the gums, but the gingival surfaces are smooth.
"
"The gingival sulcus, or gum pocket, is the narrow space between the inner wall of the gum and the tooth. As gingivitis develops, the bacteria present in these pockets changes for the worse, and the accumulation of more bacteria, which release toxins, destroy gums.
"
"In advanced gingivitis there is plaque and calculus under the gums, moderate-to-severe redness of the gums, and the gum surfaces are irregular. Dental calculus is calcium phosphate and carbonate mixed with organic matter, while plaque is a collection of food, debris, bacteria, dead skin cells, and mucous that forms within 24 hours on clean tooth surfaces. The gum responds to plaque with an inflammation of blood vessels, swelling, and collagen loss.
"
"More than 80 percent of pets three years or more of age have gingivitis. It develops earlier in life in toy breeds, and in general, affects dogs earlier in life than it does cats.
"
"Plaque accumulation is one of the main causes leading to gingivitis in dogs. Predisposing factors include:
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible conditions that might have led to this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms, such as when the bad breath began, what your dog typically eats, whether your dog has had trouble eating/chewing, and whether your dog has had any previous health conditions. The routine you have been using to keep your dog's teeth clean, if you have been using one, should be shared with your veterinarian as well, including the products you use.
"
"Part of the physical exam involves closely examining your dog's mouth to identify the condition. Your veterinarian will then make an appointment with you to bring your dog in for a dental exam. During the dental exam, your dog will be anesthetized. Your veterinarian will check the depth of the gum pockets, the amount of plaque and bacteria on the surface of the teeth, and will pull any teeth that are rotten or that are too crowded. All of the plaque and calculus will be removed using a scaling process that is done with special dental equipment, and if necessary, root planning. The tooth surfaces will be polished and the teeth will be reexamined after cleaning.
"
"
"
"If teeth are overcrowded or baby teeth are present in an adult dog, your veterinarian may remove some teeth. Special dental tools will be used to remove all plaque and calculus, to polish the teeth, and to rinse them. He or she will then teach you how to clean your pet’s teeth, and appointments for follow-up examinations should be scheduled.
"
"You can help maintain your dog’s oral health care by brushing or rubbing (with a special finger pad) its teeth once a day or at least twice a week with veterinary toothpaste. Your veterinarian may also give you a veterinary antibacterial solution to squirt on your pet’s teeth to decrease plaque build-up. Rawhide chew strips and specialized food recommended to you by your veterinarian can reduce tartar and improve the dog's oral health as well.
"
"Dogs have several salivary glands located in the neck and area around the jaw. Swelling of the salivary glands (sialocele) occurs when one (or more) of these glands leaks saliva into the tissue surrounding the gland. When a leak occurs, the body forms a capsule called a sialocele around it to prevent the saliva from spreading to nearby tissue.
"
"Swelling of the salivary gland most commonly occurs in glands in the upper neck or between the bones of the lower jaw. Other types of salivary gland swelling occur in glands under the tongue, in the upper throat, or under the eyes.
 
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Swelling is the most common symptom of salivary gland swelling. The swelling typically occurs in the area nearby the affected gland. The swollen area will feel soft and is usually not painful to the dog.
"
"Swelling may occur in a dog’s upper neck or mouth. Although the swelling may be extensive, your dog may not show any signs of experiencing pain related to the swelling.  
"
"Swelling of the neck that causes trouble swallowing or breathing can also occur. This can be serious as it can result in respiratory distress. If your dog is unable to swallow or breathe normally, they should receive immediate care from a veterinarian.
"
"Your dog may also have trouble eating or may have blood in their saliva. This occurs because the siaocele can be disrupted during eating, causing blood to leak and mix with your dog’s saliva.
"
"Enlargement of the area underneath the eye and/or protrusion of the eye itself may also occur alongside salivary gland swelling. 
 
"
"There is no known cause for swelling of the salivary glands, but some type of trauma is usually suspected. Choke collars, bite wounds, and chewing on foreign items (like sticks, etc.) are typical suspects, but the swelling may have a range of causes. 
"
"If your dog has swollen salivary glands, your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination and will feel the swollen area, to determine a possible cause.     
"
"Your veterinarian may also perform other tests to determine the cause of the swelling, including:
"
"The condition known as papilledema is associated with swelling of the optic disk located within the retina and leading to the dog's brain. This swelling can lead increased pressure on the brain and may cause other symptoms, such as inflammation of the optic nerves.
"
"When inflammation occurs it interferes with the eye's ability to transmit retinal information to the brain. Inflammation of the optic nerves may be related to inflammation on the brain or the retina, or could be solely related to the nerves. In some instances the optic nerve will only be partially inflamed, while in other instances the optic nerve will be inflamed along the full length of the retina. 
"
"Papilledema can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Depending on whether the nerves in both eyes have been affected, it may be difficult to observe symptoms. If both nerves are inflamed then signs of blindness will normally be present.
"
"Symptoms will include bumping into things; getting lost within the normal habitat; a fearful attitude; and being incapable of catching toys or finding objects. Aggressive behavior may also be present. If the disease has affected the dog's brain, neurological indicators will be present. However, if the disease is systemic in nature, the dog may display signs of weakness, anorexia and lethargy.  
"
"There are a number of underlying causes associated with this disorder, including canine distemper, a contagious viral infection found in young animals, or toxoplasmosis, which is caused by parasites. Other causes include fungal infection, water on the brain (hydrocephalus), tumors, peritonitis, inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the spinal cord and their membrane, or trauma due to injury.
"
"This condition can sometime be difficult to diagnose. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough examination of both eyes, including a check of the reflexes in the pupils and neurological nerves. Tests may also be ordered to look for fungal infections, or viral infections that are specific in nature, as well as scans to look at how well the brain is functioning.
"
"Further testing will also involve measuring the level of pressure on the dog's brain. If a systemic illness is present, the examination will include an overall physical checkup, to eliminate the presence of disease in other areas of your pet’s body. Chest X-rays may be ordered, along with abdominal x-rays as well.  
"
"
"
"In order for treatment to be effective, the cause of inflammation must first be identified.
"
"Treatment for papilledema will involve monitoring your pet closely, along with the administration of medication to treat any underlying cause of inflammation associated with the optic nerves.
"
"Optic neuritis, or swelling of the optic disk, is considered a very serious condition that could be life threatening, and as such, great care must be taken to help your dog to maintain proper health.
"
"It is important to follow your veterinarian’s medical instructions precisely in relation to the administration of medication. Follow-up visits to monitor your dog’s response to therapy, as well as any change in condition, is essential. Some animals will respond well to treatment and regain their sight, while others will not. Depending on the outcome, blindness may be permanent.

"Cytology exam: Your vet will collect a small sample of the swollen area with a very fine needle (a fine needle aspiration). The sample will be examined under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis
"
"Surgery to remove the affected gland is the most common treatment of a sialocele. Removing the gland decreases the flow of saliva into the swollen area and typically prevents similar capsules of saliva forming in the area.  
"
"After surgery, at-home care will be provided as the area continues to heal. Your veterinarian may insert a drain that will remain in place for a few days. They will also provide instructions tailored to your dog’s specific needs and severity of surgery. This may include using a cone or other barrier to prevent your dog from scratching and accidentally removing the drain. 
"
"You may also need to remove and reapply clean bandages, per your vet’s instructions.
"
"Most dogs make a complete recovery after surgery on salivary glands. Some owners worry that their dog will have a dry mouth after surgery, but currently there is no evidence to support this concern.
"
"Yes. The swelling will resolve after surgery and typically no further treatment is required. Without surgery, swelling will usually reoccur until the affected salivary gland is surgically removed.

"Cutaneous asthenia (literally, weak skin) is part of a group of hereditary disorders characterized by skin that is unusually stretchy and droopy. It is caused by a genetic mutation that is passed from parent to offspring. More than one genetic disorder is suspected, but this condition cannot be determined by skin and tissue samples, it is diagnosed through observation.
"
"This condition is also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a disease characterized by deficient levels of collagen, the protein molecule necessary for providing strength and elasticity to the skin and ligaments, along with much of the rest of the body. Collagen is the “glue” that holds the body together. A lack of collagen will result in abnormal collagen synthesis and fiber formation.
"
"Dogs affected with this disorder suffer from painful dislocation at the joints due to the instability of the ligament fibers that hold the bones to each other. The ligaments stretch with movement, but without the elasticity needed to return to their form they stay stretched out, allowing the bones to pop out of their connective joints.  This creates a painful physical environment for the sufferer of cutaneous asthenia.
"
"The lack of collagen also affects the structure of the skin. Without elasticity, the skin does not return to the body when it has been stretched away from the body, eventually drooping heavily. This lack also weakens the skin's resilience, making it easy to injure and prone to tearing, bruising and scarring.
"
"This disease is rare, and has been clearly identified in only a small number of dogs. Patients are usually diagnosed at a young age.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"The symptoms of cutaneous asthenia generally include saggy skin, with extra (redundant) folds of skin; the skin is very soft and delicate, thin, and with little elasticity. The skin is easily torn, often with wide “fish mouth” type wounds that bleed very little, but leaving scars that widen over time. There may also be scars on the skin that are unaccounted for. Your dog may have swelling under the skin of the elbows, due to the bones putting pressure on the skin when the dog is at rest, and bruising and bleeding under the skin (hematoma) of the elbows and throughout the body. Lacerations on the back and head are common. Collagen is low internally as well as externally, making it possible for internal structures to rupture, with resultant internal bleeding.
"
"With dogs, this condition commonly causes loose joints, which can vary from mild to severe. The joints may be only slightly loose, making mobility a challenge, or the joints may be loose to the point that the bones are dislocated. This can be bones of the legs, hips, and other parts of the body that are connected by joints. Rare, but also an effect this condition has on dogs, is dislocation of the eye lens. This is caused by the same lack of collagen, in this case affecting the ligaments that hold the lens in place.
"
"This condition occurs in the following breeds:
"
"The primary cause of this medical condition is heredity. It is caused by a genetic mutation that is passed from parent to offspring, and can be either dominant – from both parents, or recessive – from only one parent. In the dominant form, both parents are carriers of the mutated gene, with neither dog showing symptoms. With the recessive form, one parent may be a carrier, with no symptoms present. In either case, it is generally advised that the parents of an affected animal not be used for further breeding, and that the siblings of the affected animal also be held back from breeding.
"
"An examination of the skin's extensibility is performed by stretching the skin to its full ability, observing any lack of discomfort in the dog, and measuring the extent the skin stretches to. The resulting  measurements are based on the Skin Extensibility Index (SEI), which measures the skin that has been stretched (using the dorsal skin on the back), divided by the dog's length from the back crest of the skull to the base of the tail. The numerical value that is found determines the severity of the condition. The expected numbers are an index of higher than 14.5 percent.
"
"
"
"This condition is incurable, and the prognosis for cutaneous asthenia is not good. Many dog owners choose to euthanize in respect to the chronic pain the dog may be suffering, and the time  spent treating chronic wounds. There is also the consideration of households with other pets, or with children. Pets that are afflicted with this condition must be segregated from situations that can cause injury. Other animals can injure the affected dog, even through innocent play, and children may unintentionally pet the dog with too much vigor, causing the skin to tear. If you choose to keep your pet, it will have to be the only pet in the home, or completely separated from other pets. You will need to keep its environment free of sharp corners and other hazards, and keep sleeping and resting areas well padded to prevent elbow swelling. To prevent large skin tears, you must handle and restrain the affected dog carefully, and always inform visitors of the dog's condition so that accidental injuries do not occur.
"
"Furthermore, the animal should be neutered. This is not only to prevent passing the mutated gene, but because of injury that can occur through mating. The inherent lack of collagen makes pregnancy impossible.
"
"Lacerations, and even minor cuts in the skin, should be repaired as they occur to avoid risk of infection. Antibiotics, both external and oral, should be kept to treat your pet as needed. There has been some evidence that Vitamin C can be helpful for improving the skin, and is now recommended for owners who have decided to manage their pet's disease.

"Stomatitis, also known as canine chronic ulcerative stomatitis (CCUS), affects a dog’s gums, oral mucosa, tongue, and pharynx. It is known as a paradental disease because it does not attack the tissues that attach the tooth to the socket, it attacks the tissues that surround the teeth. It is believed that 5-10% of dogs with stomatitis also have other immune mediated diseases.  
"
"Stomatitis can cause the following symptoms: 
"
"Drooling 
"
"Severe bad breath 
"
"Pus-like oral discharge 
"
"Decreased appetite 
"
"Ulceration of parts of the tongue  
"
"Calculus (tartar) on the teeth, ranging from mild to severe 
"
"Gingivitis, ranging from mild to severe 
"
"Ulcerations on the areas of the cheek that contact teeth (otherwise known as “kissing lesions”) 
"
"If a dog had previous dental cleanings that did not improve clinical signs, a veterinarian will determine whether stomatitis is a possible diagnosis. 
"
"The exact cause of stomatitis is unknown. We do know that stomatitis is an immune system response to calculus and plaque on the teeth.
"
"A diagnosis of stomatitis is determined by taking a biopsy (a piece of tissue removed from the body for further evaluation) and histology (the study of microscopic structures of tissues).  
"
"Diagnostic testing is also used to rule out diseases that look similar to stomatitis before an appropriate treatment plan can occur. Similar diseases include: 
"
"Bullous pemphigoid 
"
"Pemphigus vulgaris 
"
"Discoid lupus 
"
"Erythematosus 
"
"Systemic lupus erythematosus 
"
"Erythema multiforme 
"
"Treatment of stomatitis starts with a professional dental cleaning. The cleaning schedule for a dog with stomatitis should be every 3-4 months to help reduce the chances of a flare-up. This type of cleaning requires a dog to be sedated to allow for proper examination of the teeth and cleaning under the gum, as well as dental radiographs so that the health of each individual tooth can be assessed. 
"
"If it is determined that a tooth is no longer viable, the tooth will be extracted. The vet may then place a sealant on the remaining teeth to slow down the decaying process. The patient is then sent home with anti-inflammatories, pain medication, and a rigorous at-home dental care schedule.  
"
"At-home care is very intensive to keep the disease from progressing and allow the dog to live as comfortably as possible for as long as possible. This includes twice-daily removal of plaque on the teeth using a chlorhexidine-based product. 
"
"If a flare-up occurs, dental wipes can be helpful until the pain subsides, as brushing is painful at this point. Once the pain is under control, routine daily or twice-a-day brushing can occur. 
"
"In addition to rigorous at-home dental care, there are medications and supplements that may be helpful in slowing down the disease process.  
"
"Your veterinarian will be able to determine the best treatment plan, including necessary medications, depending on your dog’s needs.  
"
"No, but with regular and aggressive dental care, it can be controlled. The goal with control is to ensure that the dog lives as comfortably as possible, as long as possible, and with as many teeth intact.
"
"Stomatitis is extremely painful and can create an environment that leads to the loss of teeth. It can cause the dog to stop eating and/or drinking in addition to loss of teeth.
"
"Unfortunately, no, but there are things that can be done at home to reduce the frequency and severity of flare-ups, such as regular brushing and the use of anti-plaque products.
"
"No, the disease itself is not fatal. However, a dog will not eat or drink when the mouth is painful, which is vital to the health and well-being of a dog.

"Physalopterosis is an infection of the gastrointestinal tract, caused by the parasitic organism Physaloptera spp. Typically, only a few worms are present; in fact, single worm infections are common.
"
"There is no age, breed, or gender that is more susceptible to acquiring this condition than others. If you would like to learn more about this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"An infection of stomach worms caused by Physaloptera spp. can be asymptomatic, meaning that no obvious outward signs are present, or the infection may be apparent by the presence of gastric symptoms. The primary symptom is vomiting, which can be of the chronic or acute form. In some cases, a worm, or multiple worms, will be found in the vomit contents.
"
"Stomach worms are caused by the parasitic organism Physaloptera spp. The worms are typically transmitted when an animal ingests the infective larvae that are residing in an intermediate host. Intermediate hosts, such as grubs, beetles, cockroaches, and crickets, are commonly coprophagous -- meaning they eat feces, thereby propagating the life cycle of the Physaloptera parasite.
"
"The worm can also be transmitted through ingestion of a transport host, such as a bird, rodent, frog, snake, or lizard. Outdoor exposure increases access to these intermediate or small vertebrate transport hosts, increasing the odds of contracting stomach worms. Dogs kept indoors without access to these hosts are less susceptible to infection.
"
"The primary method for identifying and diagnosing worms is through endoscopic gastroscopy, in which a small thin tube with a tiny light and camera at the end is inserted through the dog's mouth and into the stomach in order to visually examine the interior of the stomach. Worms will usually attach to the stomach lining, or to the mucus-covered lining of the intestines.
"
"A careful and thorough exam is necessary for detecting worms because there are generally not many present, and they can be hidden by mucus and stomach contents. Also, at 2.5 to 5 cm long, the worms are quite small.
"
"An examination of the dog's vomit and feces may also reveal an infection of stomach worms if worm eggs are found to be present in the contents.
"
"
"
"The worms do not necessarily have to be removed from the dog's body; treatment of stomach worms can be done at home with prescribed drugs. An adulticide designed to kill the adult worms can be prescribed, as well as other medications for the reduction of gastric symptoms.
"
"Treatment with an adulticide, and any other prescribed medications, will need to be followed as per your veterinarian's instructions. Your doctor will schedule a follow-up visit with your dog so that treatment efficacy can be assessed. Any clinical signs, or the shedding of eggs in feces, should be resolved within two weeks of treatment. If the initial treatment is unsuccessful, re-treatment may be necessary.
"
"Limiting your dog’s access to areas where intermediate hosts, or small rodent transport hosts can be found may prevent stomach worms. Outdoor exposure will increase the odds of contracting stomach worms.

"The spontaneous peristaltic (involuntary, wavelike) movements of the stomach muscles are essential for proper digestion, moving food through the stomach and out into the duodenum -- the first portion of the small intestine.
"
"Excessive gastric motility, with muscular contractions occurring too frequently, causes pain, whereas below normal motility causes delayed gastric emptying, abnormal gastric retention, gastric distention/bloating, and other related signs. Symptoms may occur at any age but it is less common in young dogs than in aging dogs.
"
"Clinical symptoms vary depending on the primary cause responsible for the gastric motility disorder. The following symptoms are commonly seen in affected dogs:
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis to look for the potential cause of the decreased or increased gastric motility. Dehydration, acid-base imbalances, and electrolyte imbalances are common in cases with chronic vomiting. An electrolyte profile will help in determining the extent of dehydration and other related abnormalities.
"
"Abdominal X-rays will help in locating excess gas, fluid or food in the distended stomach. To improve visibility on X-ray and examine the movement of the stomach, barium sulfate can be used for contrast abdominal radiography. This method uses a medium, in this case barium sulfate, to bring the interior of the body into sharper focus by adding a substance to the organ or vessel that will be visible on X-ray imaging. The barium is mixed with meal and fed to the dog, and serial radiographs are then taken to determine the length of time it takes for gastric emptying.
"
"Ultrasound is also a valuable diagnostic tool for stomach motility evaluation, and endoscopy is commonly employed for real time evaluation of the various abdominal organs, including stomach. An endoscope is a tubular device that is outfitted with a lighted camera and gathering tool. It is inserted into the body, generally by mouth, and threaded into the organ that is to be examined (e.g., bladder, stomach, etc.) so that your veterinarian can better view the internal structure of the stomach organ, discovering masses, tumors, abnormal cells, blockages, etc. The endoscope can also be used to collect a tissue sample for biopsy.
"
"
"
"Most dpgs do not require hospitalization for this condition; most likely, you will be able to return home with your pet after the initial treatment. In cases of severe bodily fluid loss (dehydration) or vomiting, your dog will need fluid therapy to restore fluid deficit and electrolyte imbalances. For proper management, a special diet may be advised for some patients with recurring gastric motility problems. Liquid or semi-liquid diets are often recommended to facilitate gastric emptying. Moreover, frequent small volume meals are preferred for affected dogs.
"
"In most uncomplicated cases, dietary manipulations alone are sufficient for successful resolution of the problem. However, in some dogs, drugs to increase gastric motility may also be employed. Animals with gastric obstruction will require surgery for correction of the problem if it cannot be resolved by any other method.
"
"In most dogs with uncomplicated gastric motility problems, the initial treatment results in a successful resolution of the problem. If your dog does not respond to the initial therapy, a further diagnostic workup may be required. The length of the treatment will depend on the resolution of the underlying disorder. If surgery is performed, it may take 10 to 14 days to regain normal gastric motility and function.

"Atrophic gastritis is a type of chronic (long-term) inflammation of the stomach lining. This condition is specifically identified via microscopic examination of tissues, revealing either a localized or diffuse reduction in the size and depth of the patient’s gastric glands. The gastric glands are the glands lining the stomach wall, secreting the gastric juices that aid in digestion.
"
"While the condition remains rare and sporadic in most dog breeds, the Norwegian Lundehund dog breed has shown a high prevalence of atrophic gastritis.
"
"Symptoms of atrophic gastritis include occasional vomiting, as well as anorexia, sluggishness, weight loss, and pica (a term describing the eating of non-food items).
"
"The exact cause of this specific type of gastritis is unknown, and may reflect chronic gastritis due to any number of reasons. Chronic gastritis may be induced in dogs that are immunized with their own gastric juice, for example. It is also believed that Helicobacter spp, a bacteria linked to vomiting and stomach illness, may be important in the development of gastritis.
"
"It is also important to note that there may be a genetic predisposition to atrophic gastritis in the Norwegian Lundehund, as is speculated due to the prevalence of the disease in this breed of dog.
"
"Definitive diagnosis of atrophic gastritis can only be achieved via the processes of gastroscopy, in which a small tube with a camera is led into the stomach for examination, and a biopsy of tissues in the stomach lining is taken for examination and diagnosis. A gastroscopy may reveal the prominence of blood vessels in the mucus-lined tissues of the stomach, which indicates mucosal thinning. Other laboratory tests, such as ultrasound imaging and urine analysis, can only be used in order to rule out other causes of symptoms and/or other forms of gastritis.
"
"
"
"Treatment for atrophic gastritis, once properly diagnosed, does not require hospitalization. Treatment is home based. Medications can be prescribed in order to inhibit the secretion of gastric acid, and additional antibiotics will be necessary if infection with the Helicobacter spp bacteria is suspected. If vomiting persists, prokinetic agents (designed to enhance muscle activity in the gastrointestinal tract) may be prescribed as well.
"
"Necessary medications will need to be administered regularly – long-term antacid therapy may be required. Use caution with medications known to worsen gastritis, such as NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).
"
"As there is no known cause exactly for this form of gastritis, there is no known prevention method. Owners of susceptible breeds, namely the Norwegian Lundehunde, should be aware of and alert for symptoms.

"
"Under normal conditions, the Helicobacter bacteria are benign inhabitants of the intestinal tract, being found in several species, including domestic animals such as dogs, cats, ferrets and pigs, in wild animals such as cheetah's and monkeys, and in humans. While gastric infection due to Helicobacter pylori is a major health problem in humans – it has been associated with gastritis, gastric tumor, and peptic ulcer in affected people – the significance of the Helicobacter bacterium in dogs and any correlation to gastric dysfunctions is still largely unclear (H. pylori specifically is not found in dogs).
"
"Various species of Helicobacter organism have been isolated from the stomachs of cats and mixed infections can present, which sometimes complicates the diagnosis. The most common forms of Helicobacter found in dogs are Helicobacter felis and Helicobacter heilmannii. Other species of Helicobacter found in dogs are Helicobacter rappini, and Helicobater salomonis. The bacteria inhabit the mucosal lining of the stomach, and the glandular cavities.
"
" 
"
"There are some reports of isolation of Helicobacter from the livers of dogs with hepatitis but this remains anecdotal. Infection from this bacteria is difficult to eradicate entirely and may last from months to years – even for a lifetime, in some dogs.
"
"Most cases remain without any symptoms at all. In others the following symptoms may be seen:
"
"Gastric Helicobacter felis, Helicobacter heilmannii, Helicobacter rappini, and Helicobater salomonis infection. The method by which this infection is transmitted remains unknown, but because of its higher prevalence in shelter dogs, oral and/or fecal transmission is considered a possibility. This assumption is supported by the presence of Helicobacter-like organisms, called GHLOs, in the vomit, feces and saliva of animals that have been infected. There is also some suspicion that the bacteria may be transmitted by water, as GHLOs have been found in some surface waters.
"
"Poor sanitary conditions and overcrowding appear to facilitate the spread of infection.
"
"Establishing a definitive diagnosis of Helicobacter infection is difficult in most instances. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests including a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. Your veterinarian may also take a sample from stomach wall and stain it with May-Grünwald-Giemsa, Gram, or Diff-Quik stains, which can easily demonstrate the presence of this organism by making it visible under microscope.
"
"An endoscopic examination is of great help for direct observation of the stomach walls as well as for taking tissue samples for further processing. This procedure uses a device called an endoscope, a camera situated at the end of a flexible tube, which is threaded into the stomach through the esophagus. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is often used both to confirm the presence of Helicobacter in a given sample and to differentiate between the species of Helicobacters. However, confirmation can also be made by taking a tissue sample using the endoscope and observing the sample through microscope.
"
"Note that the presence of gastric Helicobacters in the body do not necessarily indicate an infection that needs to be treated.
"
"
"
"As this disease is not fully described in animals, there is no single regimen accepted for treatment. If there are no apparent symptoms treatment is usually not conducted. On the contrary, in humans treatment is started if a Helicobacter infection is found, no matter whether clinical symptoms are present because such an infection can lead to stomach cancer in. However, this does not appear to be the case with dogs, so further action is not taken unless the symptoms warrant it. If there is chronic vomiting or inflammation of the gastric lining, treatment will be directed toward easing those symptoms. Typically, fluid therapy will be carried out to compensate for fluid loss.
"
"Antibiotics, along with acid controlling drugs are the recommended course of treatment for dogs found to be infected with a Helicobacter spp. Treatment generally consists of a two week course. Your will need to return to your veterinarian several weeks after the initial treatment for a follow up exam to verify whether the treatment was successful. In many cases, the infection or presence of bacteria returns, but it is not known if this is due to recrudescence (a renewal of the infection after a dormancy), or to reinfection from an outside source.
"
"Dogs that are infected with the Helicobacter bacterium are more vulnerable to stomach upset, so it is suggested that their diet be changed to food that is easily digestible. In addition, if gastritis (inflammation of the gastric lining) is present, your veterinarian can instruct you in conducting an elimination diet so that you are able to avoid the foods that are most disruptive to your dog's digestive tract.
"
"This disease is common where animals are kept in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions. If you keep many animals, be sure to provide them with enough space and a clean environment. Because this bacteria has been found to infect surface water, it is best to try to prevent your dogs (and other pets) from drinking from streams, ponds, or rivers.
"
"While this bacterial infection is suspected of having zoonotic potential between cats and humans, this is not true for dogs and humans. However, talk to your veterinarian about any concerns you may have and follow the guidelines given by your health care professional.

"Chances are, you know someone who has had a stroke and have seen the life-altering impact it can have. As a pet parent, you might be surprised to learn that dogs can have strokes, too, although much less frequently than people do.
"
"With the increased availability of MRI and CT scans for pets, strokes are being diagnosed more frequently, says Dr. Brett Levitzke, medical director of the Veterinary Emergency and Referral Group in Brooklyn, N.Y. Understanding the causes, symptoms, and treatment of strokes in dogs will help you to be a savvy pet parent.
"
"Dr. Virginia Sinnott, of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Angell Medical Center, explains that a stroke is caused by a loss of blood flow to parts of the brain that leads to tissue damage and neurologic abnormalities.
"
"There are two mechanisms that cause strokes in dogs:
"
"Ischemic strokes are more common in dogs than hemorrhagic strokes.
"
"Signs of strokes in animals can be similar to those in people, though animals do not obviously suffer from slurred speech or loss of memory. Symptoms vary depending on the location in the brain where the stroke occurred, Dr. Levitzke says.
"
"“Even in people, these signs can be subtle, and since animals can’t speak and tell us they ‘feel dizzy’ or ‘I can no longer see out of my left eye,’ subtle true strokes can go unnoticed in animals,” Dr. Sinnott adds.
"
"However, it is more common to see massive strokes in dogs, Sinnott says, but pet parents sometimes mistake fainting spells (syncope) for strokes. “Both are very serious and require immediate attention by a veterinarian,” Dr. Sinnott says.
"
"Symptoms of strokes in dogs can include:
"
"Inability to walk or walking with an uncoordinated gait
"
"Head tilt
"
"Abnormal eye movements, side to side or rotary (nystagmus)
"
"Abnormal eye positioning (strabismus)
"
"Loss of consciousness
"
"Abnormal behavior
"
"Falling to one side
"
"Blindness
"
"Abnormal behavior
"
"Rapid onset of symptoms
"
"“Generally, one minute owners report the pet is fine, and the next [the pet] cannot get up. These signs may last for a few minutes or much longer (hours to days),” Dr. Sinnott says.
"
"It’s important to note, however, that many of these symptoms are seen with other more common conditions in dogs including idiopathic vestibular disease, which frequently affects older dogs, and even severe ear infections.
"
"Dr. Sinnott says vets typically see only a couple of cases of strokes in dogs every year, and when they do occur, it is usually in a very old dog who has diseases that can increase the risk of clots or bleeding.
"
"“The signs can be frightening and may be associated with discomfort for the dog, and some owners elect to euthanize their pets,” Dr. Sinnott says in the cases of severe strokes in very old dogs.
"
"The underlying diseases that can cause strokes in dogs include:
"
"Kidney disease
"
"Cushing’s disease (hyperadrenocorticism)
"
"Hypertension
"
"Diabetes
"
"Heart disease
"
"Bleeding disorders
"
"Hypothyroidism
"
"Cancer
"
"In some cases, high doses of steroids, such as prednisone, can lead to stroke.
"
"While no one breed is more likely to suffer a stroke than another, Dr. Levitzke says some breeds are prone to some of the underlying diseases that cause strokes, such as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, which have a high rate of heart disease.
"
"Proper diagnosis is the most important part of treating strokes in dogs. A fainting spell that might look like a stroke can be caused by an abnormal heart rhythm, which can be life-threatening. Your vet can distinguish a stroke from other diseases that cause similar symptoms with a physical examination, including examining your dog’s heart functions to rule out a cardiac problem that can cause fainting. Tests may include an electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-rays, and possibly a cardiac ultrasound, Dr. Sinnott says.
"
"If the heart is normal, the brain can be examined using an MRI or CAT scan. Your vet might also do more testing to look for underlying diseases that could cause a blood clot, such as hormone testing, bloodwork, and urinalysis.
"
"Once the cause is determined, treatment will aim to resolve it, Dr. Levitzke says. If a clot caused the stroke, blood thinners might be prescribed. High blood pressure medications can be used for a stroke caused by hypertension.
"
"“The neurologic signs associated with a stroke are allowed to resolve on their own as the patient’s body re-establishes blood flow to the affected area and swelling resolves. Medications such as steroids, mannitol, and hypertonic saline can help resolve swelling in the brain,” Dr. Levitzke says.
"
"Supplemental oxygen is a mainstay of treatment to maximize oxygen delivery to damaged tissues and promote healing.
"
"Managing urination and defecation, maintaining good nutrition, and physical therapy (massage, passive range of motion of limbs, if needed, etc.) are also important for healing. “The brain is very adept at recovery, though it can take time,” says Dr. Levitzke.
"
"Because strokes in dogs are often associated with underlying disease processes, routine check-ups with a veterinarian and screening blood work can identify potential causes that can be addressed before a stroke happens, says Dr. Levitzke. Staying on top of wellness care as dogs age is essential to their health and happiness.

"Dysphagia, the medical term given to difficulty swallowing, can occur anatomically as oral dysphagia (in the mouth), pharyngeal dysphagia (in the pharynx itself), or cricopharyngeal dysphagia (at the far end of the pharynx entering the esophagus).
"
"Oral dysphagia can be caused by paralysis of the jaw, tongue paralysis, dental disease, swelling or wasting away of the chewing muscles, or by an inability to open the mouth. Animals with oral dysphagia often eat in an altered way, such as tilting the head to one side or throwing the head backward while eating. Food packed in the cheek folds of the mouth without saliva are also typical signs of oral dysphagia.
"
"Pharyngeal dysphagia is when the dog can grab food, but must repeatedly attempt to swallow while flexing and extending the head and neck, chewing excessively and gagging. While food is retained in the cheek folds of the mouth, it is saliva-coated. There is a diminished gag reflex and there may be snotty discharge from the nose.
"
"With cricopharyngeal dysphagia the dog may succeed at swallowing after several attempts, but afterward it gags, coughs and forcibly throws its food back up. Unlike pharyngeal dysphagia, the gag reflex is normal. Animals suffering from cricopharyngeal dysphagia are often very thin.
"
"Anatomic/mechanical causes:
"
"Dysphagia caused by pain:
"
" 
"
"Neuromuscular causes:
"
"Pharyngeal weakness or paralysis causes:
"
"Neurological causes:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as recent illnesses or injuries. Your veterinarian will order standard tests, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood profile and a urinalysis. These tests will indicate if your pet has an infectious disease, kidney disease or a muscular injury. During the physical exam it is crucial that your veterinarian distinguish between vomiting and dysphagia. Vomiting involves abdominal contractions while dysphagia does not.
"
"Your veterinarian may also draw blood to run laboratory tests for inflammatory disorders of the chewing muscles, like masticatory muscle myositis, as well as for myasthenia gravis, immune-mediated diseases, hyperadrenocorticism and hypothyroidism.
"
"Your veterinarian will take X-ray and ultrasound images of your dog's skull and neck to inspect for any abnormalities. An ultrasound of the pharynx will help your veterinarian to visualize masses and help take tissue samples if needed. If your veterinarian suspects that your dog has a brain tumor, a computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to locate the tumor and determine its severity.
"
"
"
"Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the dysphagia. If your dog's problems with eating are being caused by an abnormality of the mouth (oral dysphagia), you will need to feed your dog by placing a ball of food at the back of its throat and helping it to swallow. Patients suffering from pharyngeal or cricopharyngeal dysphagia may be helped to eat by lifting the head and neck during swallowing. If your dog cannot maintain a good body weight, your veterinarian may opt to insert a stomach tube. If a mass or foreign body is present due to your dog swallowing it, surgery may be necessary to remove it.
"
"It is essential to keep your dog at a good body weight while it undergoes treatment. If your dog does not have a stomach tube placed and you are feeding it by hand, be sure to give it several small meals a day while it is sitting upright. You will need to support your dog in an upright position like this for 10 to 15 minutes after every meal to prevent aspiration pneumonia, which occurs when food is inhaled into the lungs.
"
"Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia include depression, fever, pus-like nasal discharge, coughing, and/or problems breathing. If your dog should ever show any of these signs, call your veterinarian immediately and/or take your dog to an emergency veterinary clinic for immediate treatment.

"Eosinophilic gastroenteritis in dogs is an inflammatory condition of the stomach and intestines. The name of the disease is derived from the fact that lining of the stomach and intestines is infiltrated with a specific type of white blood cell known as an eosinophil.
"
"Eosinophilic gastroenteritis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is most commonly seen in dogs less than 5 years of age, though it can affect dogs of any age. German Shepherds, Rottweilers, soft-coated Wheaten Terriers, and Shar Peis may be predisposed. Symptoms include:
"
"In order to confirm the diagnosis a veterinarian will typically examine your dog's feces for parasites. In many cases, deworming with a broad spectrum deworming product is used to help rule out parasites as well. Routine blood testing (including a complete blood cell count and blood chemistry profile) and urinalysis may also be performed to check for abnormalities in organ function and blood cells.
"
"Imaging such as radiographs (X-rays) and abdominal ultrasonography may be used to examine the intestinal tract more thoroughly, while dietary trials may be performed to diagnose food allergies or hypersensitivities.
"
"Definitive diagnosis is made by collecting samples of the stomach and intestines for biopsy via endoscopy or exploratory surgery. If your veterinarian suspects idiopathic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, diagnosis is attained by ruling out other causes.
"
"
"
"If an underlying cause is discovered, it is important that it be treated first. Parasites, for instance, are treated with an appropriate dewormer. Food allergies and hypersensitivities are controlled with an appropriate diet.
"
"Gastrointestinal ulcers are an erosion of one or more layers of the stomach or small intestines. Gastric, or stomach ulcers are the most common, followed by ulcers in the first part of the small intestines, called the duodenum.  
"
"During digestion, the stomach secretes harsh gastric acids and enzymes, which start breaking down food in the stomach to extract nutrients. To protect against these corrosive stomach juices, the stomach is lined with a mucosal barrier. If this barrier breaks down, the stomach lining will gradually erode, causing ulcers.
"
"Ulcers vary in severity. Erosions may wear through a few layers (non-perforating ulcers) or may create a hole through the stomach wall (perforating ulcers). Perforating ulcers are the most dangerous because holes in the gastrointestinal tract allow the stomach’s contents to spill into the abdominal cavity. Ulcers can affect the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems which leads to sepsis.
"
"Call your veterinarian as soon as possible for an exam and diagnostic testing if you think your dog may have an ulcer.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The most common sign of gastrointestinal ulcers is vomiting, often with blood. Depending on the ulcer’s severity, location, and frequency, other signs may include:
"
"Weight loss
"
"Melena (dark, tarry stools)
"
"In cases where protein is lost from the intestines, special fluid products known as colloids may be required. Dehydration, meanwhile, must be corrected with fluid therapy.
"
"Steroids such as prednisone or prednisolone are frequently used in treatment of eosinophilic gastroenteritis in dogs. Other medications that may be necessary include anti-emetics to control vomiting and nausea.

"There are broad categories of conditions or situations that cause ulcers in dogs. Some are more common than others and include:
"
"Drugs: such as NSAIDs: (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, which include Rimadyl and Deramax) and steroids (like prednisone and dexamethasone).
"
"Gastrointestinal diseases: including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ingested foreign material and an increase in the production of gastric acid.
"
"Infectious diseases: such as pythiosis (a waterborne infection) and helicobacter bacterial infections.
"
"Metabolic diseases: including liver, kidneys, and adrenal glands (Addison’s disease).
"
"Heavy metal poisoning: including arsenic, zinc, thallium, iron, and lead.
"
"Cancers of the gastrointestinal tract: such as carcinoma, lymphoma, leiomyoma, and GI stromal tumor.
"
"Stress can also lead to ulcers. Severe shock and low blood pressure (usually due to trauma or surgery), heat stroke sepsis, thermal burns, and strenuous exercise in extreme temperatures (cold or hot) are some examples of stressors.
"
"Sled dogs, and other elite canine athletes, are prone to develop stomach ulcers.
"
"A biopsy is required to diagnose an ulcer. Biopsy samples are especially useful to determine the underlying reason for the ulcer, most notably cancer or infections.
"
"Veterinarians may recommend many tests before getting to a biopsy. A dog’s history of vomiting, especially with blood, may give veterinarians a strong suspicion of an ulcer, especially a dog who has a history of being prescribed ulcer-causing drugs (NSAIDs or steroids). Tests may include:
"
"Removal of any underlying cause (drugs, toxicities, cancer) is the priority in treating dogs with ulcers. Dogs with stomach ulcers may require hospitalization and supportive care, depending on the severity. Clinically sick dogs and those with perforated ulcers require intensive nursing care. These animals may require:
"
"Blood transfusions
"
"IV fluid support
"
"Emergency surgery
"
"Partial-thickness, non-perforating ulcers may be treated on an outpatient basis. These dogs will require a bland diet and gastroprotectant medications.
"
"Common GI medications include:
"
"Sucralfate protects the mucosa by coating the ulcer. It can also stimulate ulcer healing.
"
"H2 receptor antagonists block receptors in the stomach to decrease gastric acid secretion. The most well-known H2 receptor antagonist is Pepcid (famotidine).
"
"Proton pump inhibitors are generally regarded as superior to H2 receptor antagonists to prevent ulcerations. Omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are all options in this drug family.
"
"Prostaglandin E analogs, like Misoprostol (Cytotec) works by increasing mucosal protection by decreasing gastric acid secretion. Some veterinarians will use this drug to prevent ulcers in animals with chronic NSAID therapy.
"
"Dogs may require a long-term diet change. However, if the underlying cause is removed, they may return to normal life. Common diet recommendations include:
"
"Purina EN Line
"
"Royal Canin GI Line
"
"Hill’s i/d Line
"
"Surgical therapy may also be considered if an ulcer has perforated, or if cancer is present.
"
"The prognosis for dogs with gastrointestinal ulcers is typically good and based on underlying causes and response to treatment. Perforated ulcers are more serious, and the prognosis is guarded. Less complicated forms of ulcers should show signs of improvement within 5 to 7 days.
"
"Depending on the cause, some dogs may be at risk for future ulcerations. These dogs may be placed on specialized gastrointestinal diets and may remain on ulcer-preventative drugs.
"
"Dogs on chronic NSAID therapy may benefit from receiving their NSAID with food, in addition to preventative GI medications.
"
"There are many causes of ulcers in dogs, most notably common medications, internal organ dysfunction, chronic diseases, and cancer.
"
"Yes! For some types of ulcerations, the prognosis is fairly positive.
"
"Vomiting is the most common sign, sometimes with blood or coffee-ground material.
"
"Most ulcers respond to treatment within 5 to 7 days.

"Leiomyosarcoma is an uncommon cancerous tumor, which, in this case, arises from the smooth muscles of the stomach and intestines. It is an extremely dangerous and painful disease that affects mostly older dogs (more than six years old), though all breeds are equally predisposed to leimyosarcoma. Moreover, the cancer has a tendency to metastasize to other sites in the gastrointestinal tract and other body organs.
"
"Most symptoms are related to gastrointestinal tract, including:
"
"The exact cause for this cancer is currently unknown.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are usually within normal ranges. However, in some dogs with advanced forms of the disease, few abnormalities, including anemia, abnormally highly number of white blood cells (leukocytosis), and abnormally low glucose levels (hypoglycemia) may be noted. Other diagnostic procedures include abdominal X-rays and ultrasounds, which help to identify changes in the stomach and intestinal walls, such as thickening of the wall. Contrast radiography, meanwhile, is used to enhance visualization of tissue and improve localization of the tumor.
"
"Endoscopy is another valuable tool for direct visualization of the affected areas. This is performed with an endoscope, a rigid or flexible tube inserted into the esophagus down to the stomach and intestines. As well as visually inspecting the region, the veterinarian will remove a sample of the affected area (stomach and/or intestine) for biopsy to confirm diagnosis.
"
"
"
"Surgery remains the treatment of choice, which involves resection of the tumor mass along with some normal tissue. However, the extent of metastasis (such as in the liver) is a critical factor for final prognosis.
"
"In cases of metastasis to other body organs, prognosis is very poor, where survival may only be a few months. Surgery may improve survival rates in some animals, but will require complete removal of the tumor mass. Following the surgery, you will have to take your dog for routine checkups, X-rays, and abdominal ultrasound every three months. Some dogs may also require special, easily digestible diets, as well as painkillers to alleviate soreness. Strictly adhere to the veterinarian's guidelines watch for recurrence of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distention, and abdominal pain in the dog.

"Staph infections are caused by the overgrowth of Staphylococcus bacteria on the surface of a dog’s skin. Small amounts of this type of bacteria are normally found on dogs.
"
"However, when the skin barrier becomes damaged or the immune system is weakened, bacteria can overgrow, which leads to an infection. The skin becomes red and itchy because of inflammation or swelling as well as the infection.
"
"It's rare for a healthy dog to develop a staph infection unless there’s a wound on their skin.
"
"Puppies and adult dogs with chronic illnesses are more prone to staph infections because of their weakened immune systems. Also, dogs with pre-existing conditions that affect the skin barrier are very prone to getting staph infections. This includes dogs with environmental allergies, food allergies, hypothyroidism, or ectoparasites (demodex or fleas).
"
"Mild staph infections are not considered an emergency and often heal with minimal treatment. However, severe staph infections can cover the entire body and also invade tissue under the skin to create a deep, potentially life-threatening infection. Severe infections should be considered a medical emergency.

"Speak with your vet if your pup is displaying symptoms of a staph infection.
"
"Superficial (skin-level) staph infections:
"
"Rash
"
"Itchiness (licking, chewing, biting, or scratching)
"
"Hair loss
"
"Redness of skin
"
"Crusting of skin
"
"Moist skin           
"
"Deep staph infections can cause these additional symptoms:
"
"Fever
"
"Skin is sensitive to touch
"
"Lethargy (sleepy or weak)
"
"Shivering
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Draining tracts (oozing wounds)
"
"Any medical condition that causes scratching, chewing, or licking of the skin can lead to development of a staph infection, but there are other causes as well.
"
"Here is an extensive list:
"
"Environmental allergy
"
"Contact allergy
"
"Food allergy
"
"Fleas
"
"Hypothyroidism
"
"Demodectic mange (demodex)
"
"Sarcoptic mange (scabies)
"
"Urine scalding (direct contact with urine for a long period of time, causing the skin to become moist, leading to irritation and infection)
"
"Matted coat
"
"Open wound
"
"Skin folds on a dog’s face or body
"
"Obesity
"
"Corkscrew tails
"
"Hooded vulva
"
"Any dog, no matter its age or breed, can develop a staph infection. However, certain breeds are at a higher risk.
"
"Dog breeds with skin folds on their face or bodies—such as Pugs, English Bulldogs, Mastiffs, French Bulldogs, and Shar-Pei—are more vulnerable.
"
"Additionally, the following breeds are more prone to environmental allergies:
"
"Pit Bull Terriers
"
"French Bulldogs
"
"English Bulldogs
"
"Golden Retrievers
"
"Labrador Retrievers
"
"Cocker Spaniels
"
"West Highland White Terriers
"
"Boxers
"
"Dogs with a compromised (weakened) immune system because of their age (less than 1 year old) or an underlying medical condition (cancer, immune-mediated disease) are also prone to staph infections.
"
"Vets may diagnose a pup with a staph infection using:
"
"Skin cytology—A simple test where a piece of clear tape is gently put on a skin lesion and then removed. The tape is then stained and looked at under the microscope. The veterinarian will see round-shaped bacteria called cocci, which usually indicate a staph infection.
"
"Aerobic skin culture and sensitivity—The gold standard test for diagnosing a staph infection. The strain of bacteria is identified from a culture plate and tested against various antibiotics. These three strains of staphylococcal organisms can be very resistant to numerous antibiotics: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP), S. aureus (MRSA), and S. schleiferi (MRSS).
"
"The treatment of a staph infection depends on location, severity, symptoms, how well the pet parent follows the treatment plan, and the dog’s tolerance to the treatment prescribed.
"
"Topical therapy is usually prescribed first for treatment of a staph infection. It may include:
"
"Medicated antibacterial shampoo with 3-4% chlorhexidine, like TrizChlor® 4 shampoo or Douxo S3™ PYO shampoo.
"
"Medicated antibacterial wipes like TrizChlor™ 4 wipes or Douxo S3™ PYO wipes.
"
"Antibacterial mousse such as Douxo S3™ PYO mousse.
"
"Antibiotic ointment, like Neosporin. However, ointment is often not recommended because it can rub off or be licked off.
"
"Antibacterial spray, such as TrizChlor™ 4 spray or Gentamicin with Betamethasone Topical Spray (formerly called Gentaspray), which requires a prescription.
"
"It’s important to ask your vet which topical therapy is best for your dog.
"
"Oral antibiotics such as cephalexin, cefpodoxime, or clindamycin are prescribed by a vet when a skin infection is not responding to topical therapy alone, the staph infection is severe, or the infection is in areas that would be difficult to treat with topical therapy.
"
"A dog’s itchiness also needs to be addressed when treating a staph infection. The two most effective and safest anti-itch treatment options are:
"
"Apoquel®
"
"Cytopoint®
"
"When treating a dog for a skin infection, it’s important to keep their coat and skin clean and dry. Avoid water activities, like swimming, as water will moisten your pup’s skin lesions. Your dog should also be kept mostly indoors in a clean environment.
"
" Most dogs usually recover within two to three weeks. However, deep or extensive staph infections can take four to six weeks to clear. Immunocompromised dogs—such as very young puppies or dogs with a chronic disease—can struggle with recovery. It may take longer for them to recover, or they may not.
"
"Check your dog’s skin daily to be sure that the affected area is improving. If an antibiotic is prescribed, make sure not to miss any doses and do not stop giving it to your pup without your vet’s strict instruction.
"
"A dog’s itchiness must also be managed with Cytopoint®, Apoquel®, and/or a recovery cone to prevent licking, scratching, and chewing.
"
"Consult with your vet on when to schedule a recheck appointment to have your dog’s skin looked at again after starting treatment.
"
"Staph infections are not 100% preventable—staph naturally lives on a dog’s skin. However, here are steps that can be taken to lower the risk of a staph infection:
"
"Schedule an appointment with your vet if your dog is itchy, has skin lesions, or has an open wound.
"
"Bathe your dog when needed to keep the skin and coat clean. If your dog’s fur is prone to matting, brush the fur often or schedule professional grooming appointments regularly.
"
"Keep your dog’s skin folds clean.
"
"If your dog is overweight, consult with your vet to create a weight loss plan for your pup.
"
"Having a hooded vulva or corkscrew tail can sometimes be managed with topical therapy, though it may require surgery.
"
"If your dog has allergies, talk with your vet about how to best manage your pet’s allergy.
"
"Prevent urine scalding. Have your veterinarian figure out the cause for the urine scalding and discuss prevention and treatment methods.
"
"Yes, a staph infection can be shared from a dog to a person, another dog, or a cat, but it’s uncommon. Frequent hand washing and cleaning a dog’s crate and bedding can help prevent the spread of bacteria between other pets and people.
"
"Immunocompromised family members should avoid touching a dog that has a staph infection until the infection has been treated.
"
"If there’s a skin lesion on your dog, it’s in your dog’s best interest to have their vet examine them to look at the skin lesion. Ringworm and yeast infections can look similar to staph infections.
"
"Yes, a dog diagnosed with MRSP, MRSA, or MRSS should not be allowed to lick a person’s face or any open wounds because this may lead to spread of the bacterial infection.

"Steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis describes the combined conditions of inflammation of the protective membranes covering the spinal cord and brain (meninges), and inflammation of the walls of the arteries. It causes changes in the blood vessels of the heart, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal system.
"
"Steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis occurs worldwide and it is thought dogs may be genetically predisposed to the disease. However, any dog breed may be affected. Moreover, it occurs mainly in dogs that are less than two years of age.
"
"The disease can be sudden (acute) or long-term (chronic):
"
"Sudden
"
"Long-term
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as accidents or previous illnesses. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a neurologic exam. Standard laboratory tests will include a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will also be taken to check for cells and protein levels.
"
"
"
"Your dog will need to be hospitalized initially to treat the fever and for fluid therapy. Ice packs or cool water baths are the standard treatment for lowering body temperature, but your veterinarian will base which treatment to use on your dog's overall condition. The dog's physical activity level should not be reduced, as muscle atrophy can result from lack of movement. If your dog is in pain or suffering from paralysis of any kind, you will need to plan a physical routine that will work around those problems, while still keeping your dog in motion to prevent muscle atrophy. Your doctor will prescribe pain medication and steroids for your pet, and can help you to make a plan for keeping your dog physically active without placing too much pressure on the dog and causing more pain or stress.
"
"Treatment must be continued for six months or the patient will relapse.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule a follow up appointment for your dog every four to six weeks after the initial treatment to check the bloodwork and to test the CSF. Treatment lasts about six months.

"Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of disorders affecting the dog's hematopoietic stem cells, which forms all the types of blood cells in the body (i.e., red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets). These disorders are characterized by the abnormal development and maturation of hematopoietic stem cells, and may be primary (congenital) or secondary (due to cancer, drugs exposure, and/or infections).
"
"Myelodysplastic syndromes more common in cats than dogs.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Blood testing is especially important in making the diagnosis, as it may reveal abnormal reduction in the number of blood cells (cytopenia). In some dogs, megaloblastic anemia is also seen.
"
"Other abnormal findings may include large, bizarre platelets and immature granulocytes (type of white blood cells) with abnormal shape and sizes. Your veterinarian will also take bone marrow sample to evaluate the red blood cell and white blood cells production process and identify abnormalities.
"
"
"
"Treatment is usually non-specific unless the underlying cause is identified. Often, dogs suffering from myelodysplastic syndromes are prone to severe complications, such as infections, and require intensive nursing care. In these cases, these animal will undergo antibiotic therapy until their white blood cell count normalizes. These dogs are also more susceptible to severe anemia and hemorrhages and will require multiple blood transfusions.
"
"Regular blood testing is required throughout treatment to evaluate the animal's progress. Unfortunately, the overall prognosis of these animals is not good, even after treatment. Maintaining the dog stable is, however, necessary to prevent further aggravation of symptoms.

"Uterine inertia is a condition in which the pregnant female dog is unable to birth her fetuses due to uterine muscle's inability to contract and expel the puppies from the uterus.
"
"The main symptom is the inability to initiate the process of birthing (parturition) at the end of the normal gestation period. Often the patient is bright and alert and does not appear to be in distress. In some cases, the bitch may deliver one or two fetuses normally, after which labor ceases, even though there are still more fetuses in the uterus.
"
"If your dog has passed the date at which she should have given birth, or has delivered some but not all of her young and her labor appears to have stopped completely, you will need to consult with a veterinarian before things take a turn for the worse. Your dog's general health and previous parturition history will be taken into account by your veterinarian.
"
"The initial physical examination will include evaluating your dog's mental and physical health and placing her in a quiet space in the hopes of restarting her labor so that it can progress normally. Her rectal temperature will be recorded, which will help in establishing the stage of parturition she is in. In animals that are near to parturition, but have not yet showed signs of onset of labor, the rectal temperature drops below normal. If the signs are present, it will be taken as an indicator of the initiation of labor. Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolytes, and urinalysis.
"
"In patients with primary uterine inertia, the results of these tests are often found to be normal. However, in some animals the biochemistry profile may show abnormally low levels of calcium and blood glucose. Calcium is essential for proper contractions of the muscles, including the uterine muscles. If the blood is low in calcium this will be indicative of the direction the treatment will need to go.
"
"If time and resources allow, your veterinarian will have the blood sample checked for hormonal levels, notably progesterone. If serum progesterone levels remain low, this finding will help in establishing the diagnosis. Your veterinarian will also take abdominal X-rays and/or ultrasound to assess the number and position of the fetuses, and to check their heart rate. Depending on the findings from the examination, your veterinarian may be able to use labor inducing drugs, or may find it necessary to perform a cesarean surgery to remove the puppies.
"
"
"
"Drugs to promote uterine muscle contractions will be given on the basis of the preliminary diagnosis. Repeated injections are often required with continuous monitoring to watch over the mother's progress. Intravenous fluids may also be used as a way of administering drugs and supplements to your dog, while also keeping her hydrated.
"
"Normal calcium and glucose levels are required for normal contractions of uterine muscles. If your dog is exhibiting low levels of calcium or glucose, intravenous therapy will be initiated. Unfortunately, not all dogs will respond to medical treatment. In these cases an immediate caesarean section surgery is performed to avoid fetal stress and death of the puppies and mother.
"
"Your dog will need proper rest in a stress free environment in the time just before the due date, and during and after labor. The overall prognosis, for both the mother and her young, is generally favorable if medical assistance or surgical treatment is given without delay.

"The dog's body, like the human body, has a musculoskeletal system that has muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, joints, and bones. All of these structures can be injured while running, jumping, or playing, or even by taking a bad step in the backyard. Sometimes these injuries are mild and self-limiting, resolving on their own after some rest. Other times, they are more serious and require veterinary help.
"
"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the change, growth, and uncontrollable reproduction of squamous cells in dogs. These batches of unusual cells begin to form a malignant (cancerous) tumor. This is different from a benign, or non-cancerous, tumor.
"
"Your dog’s skin is composed of three main layers. These layers include the subcutaneous layer (deepest layer of the skin, composed of fat and connective tissue), the dermis (second-deepest layer, containing tissue, blood vessels, and sweat glands), and the epidermis (surface of the skin).
"
"The surface of the skin has three cell types:
"
"Melanocytes—These cells are in the skin and eyes, and make pigment called melanin. They are found in the base layer of the skin.
"
"Basal cells—These cells produce new skin cells and make up the middle layer of the skin.
"
"Squamous cells—They are found in the outermost layer of the skin, toward the surface.
"
"Squamous cell carcinoma can develop anywhere squamous cells are found in dogs, including:
"
"The mouth
"
"The terms “sprain” and “strain” are often used interchangeably. They are called soft tissue injuries because they are orthopedic injuries that do not affect any bones.
"
"Technically, a sprain is a stretch or tear in a ligament, and a strain is an injury to the muscle itself or the tendon. Ligaments are bands of strong connective tissue that connect two bones together, while tendons are bands of connective tissue that connect muscles to bones.
"
"When soft tissue injuries occur, there is usually immediate pain. Dogs will often limp or favor the injured leg. This lameness may be accompanied by heat or swelling of the painful leg. Spraining your ankle is an example of a soft tissue injury. None of the bones in the ankle are broken, but it is still painful and hard to walk on that foot.

"
"If your dog has a soft tissue injury, they may show the following signs:
"
"Lameness (not putting full weight on a leg)
"
"Difficulty getting up from sitting or slow to sit down from standing
"
"Decreased activity
"
"Heat at the injury site
"
"Swelling
"
"Trouble jumping or avoiding stairs
"
"Decreased playing
"
"Stiffness
"
"Vocalizing (whining, acting like they’re in pain)
"
"Sprains and strains are injuries that occur any time there is minor trauma. Sprains are usually the result of twisting a joint the wrong way so that the ligament is pulled, stretched, or torn.
"
"Strains are often caused by overuse, or too much force on the tendon or muscle. This can occur with intense physical activity, like agility tests, running, jumping, or roughhousing with other dogs. Suddenly taking off to chase a squirrel or wrestling with another dog at the dog park can result in a soft tissue injury. Sometimes just going down the stairs and skipping a step or jumping off the bed awkwardly can lead to injury as well.

"
"It is typically categorized as oral (the mouth and nasal cavity), subungual (affecting nail beds and toes), or cutaneous (in the skin).
"
"Squamous cell carcinoma typically consists of a single lesion, or skin sore, somewhere on the body. The exception is multicentric squamous cell carcinoma, which produces multiple sores in more than one area. This is very rare in dogs.
"
"Squamous cell carcinoma sores can differ from each other. They are often small, red, and irritated-looking in appearance. They can ulcerate break open or be covered by thickened patches of skin, called plaques.
"
"Sores can have additional effects on a dog depending on their location and severity. For example, sores on the toe or nail bed may result in the loss of a dog’s nail. Sores that have broken open and exposed a dog’s body to outside germs may become infected, especially if a dog chews or licks the area.
"
"
"
"Symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma in dogs include:
"
"Small sore(s) on the body that appear inflamed, red, covered in thickened skin, or bloody
"
"Licking or chewing a certain area of the body
"
"Missing toenails, blood on the floor, difference in walking or reluctance to walk
"
"Excessive drooling with or without blood
"
"Difficulty swallowing or chewing
"
"Changes in walking, or the reluctance or inability to walk
"
"Weight loss
"
"Cancer is a complex disease. Your dog’s risk for getting squamous cell carcinoma depends on a few factors, including their genetics, environment, and family history.
"
"Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light is a well-studied environmental risk. Another cause of squamous cell carcinoma could be canine papillomavirus ( papillomas or warts caused by viruses).
"
"Squamous cell carcinoma is more common in certain breeds, such as:
"
"American Pit Bull Terrier
"
"Highly athletic dogs are more prone to muscle strains, like iliopsoas muscle strain, as they engage in more high-impact activity. Accidentally going splay-legged when running can also lead to strain on this muscle-tendon junction.
"
"The cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) in the dog acts like the ACL in the human knee and is a common site for sprains in dogs. Large-breed dogs more commonly are affected by tears in their CCL.  Dogs with CCL injury often have a more steep angle in their knee joint between the bone and the ligament, and that puts more force on the ligament than in dogs who do not carry this trait in their genes.
"
"Cruciate ligament tears can occur secondary to physical activity—from sudden twisting, like stepping in a hole or jumping while turning.
"
"If a sprain or strain is suspected in your dog, the veterinarian will start by doing a full physical exam. They will watch how your dog moves and may put your dog’s joints through range-of-motion tests to figure out if there are any restrictions in movement. They will feel each joint in the affected limb and look for heat, swelling, and signs of discomfort. If a torn CCL is suspected, they will likely check for something called cranial drawer, which is an abnormal sliding motion in the knee joint that is not present when the ligament is intact. 
"
"Once the veterinarian has determined which part of the leg is the source of the pain, they may recommend x-rays. These can help to rule out underlying fractures or other orthopedic disease like hip or elbow dysplasia, arthritis, bone cancer, or infection. X-rays can also help the doctor determine how much secondary damage has occurred in the joint following a soft tissue injury. After a CCL tear, the knee joint may develop bone spurs as the body produces new bone to stabilize the joint.
"
"Occasionally, advanced diagnostics like ultrasonography, CT, or MRI are recommended, especially in athletic dogs that compete in agility or other canine sports. If these tests are recommended, your veterinarian may refer you to an orthopedic specialist.
"
"Many sprains and strains can be treated simply with rest and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as Rimadyl, Metacam, or Galliprant.
"
"If rest is recommended, it is important to keep your dog’s activity level as low as possible. Leash walk only when taking them outside to eliminate. No running, jumping, or playing is allowed when your dog is under a strict rest order. Avoid letting them jump up on furniture or go up and down stairs, as these activities put force on the joints. Utilize the kennel as much as possible to keep them well-rested.
"
"If your veterinarian prescribes your dog an anti-inflammatory medication, be sure to follow the label instructions. If you notice any side effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, or loss of appetite, stop the medication and contact your veterinarian right away. Do not give any over-the-counter human NSAID medications, as dogs are more sensitive to this class of drugs and may have serious, even life-threatening reactions to inappropriate doses of these medications.
"
"Cold pack therapy may be recommended in some soft tissue injuries if your dog will cooperate. To accomplish this, you can use a bag of frozen vegetables and hold it over the affected region of your dog’s leg for 5-10 minutes to provide relief. Sometimes physical therapy may be recommended following a period of rest. Your veterinarian is the best person to determine a physical therapy plan if needed.
"
"Some sprains, like CCL tears, may require surgery for treatment. There are many approaches to successfully treating a CCL tear, and options vary depending on the dog. Large-breed dogs, those weighing at least 50 pounds, often require TPLO surgery, where a metal plate is placed on the bone following some surgical cuts that change the angle of the joint and decrease the forces acting on the cruciate ligament. This surgery is done by an orthopedic surgeon and often requires a referral to a specialty hospital.
"
"Smaller-breed dogs may benefit from a surgery called a lateral suture. Many private practitioners offer this surgery. It involves surgically entering the joint and running a sterile implant into the joint that acts like a false ligament to replace the ligament that was torn.
"
"Some dogs are too old or have underlying health conditions that rule out anesthesia. These patients may benefit from specialty braces that work to stabilize the joint while the body produces scar tissue to increase comfort over time.
"
"In canine sports medicine, extracorporeal shock wave therapy may be pursued to break down tendinous scar tissue. Some dogs may also benefit from cold laser therapy aimed at decreasing inflammation (swelling) and pain. Joint health supplements, like Dasuquin, may help to slow cartilage breakdown following an injury to protect the joints.
"
"Some veterinarians recommend Adequan injections after an injury, to maintain joint health. Adequan provides the building blocks of joint fluid to help lubricate the joints. While vets cannot undo underlying arthritis that may result from injury to joints, this medication can slow further cartilage breakdown and lubricate those joints so that there is less grinding and more comfort when the dog is walking, running, or playing.
"
"For many soft tissue injuries, recovery involves 2-4 weeks of strict rest before your dog is back to normal comfort and mobility. After surgery such as for a torn CCL, recovery may be longer, about 8-12 weeks.
"
"While your dog is healing, it’s important to limit their activity. While pain and anti-inflammatory medications are important to restore comfort and limit scar tissue formation, they do block pain, and many dogs will immediately try to go back to normal activity. Pet parents must work hard to prevent their dogs from overdoing it while recovering from a sprain or strain.
"
"Use the leash for all outdoor time to keep them from suddenly bolting after a squirrel or running the fence line to bark at another dog. Use the kennel as much as possible if you have another dog they like to wrestle with in the home, keep your injured dog in another room while you are not home. If you are struggling to keep your dog’s activity level down during the recovery period, talk to your veterinarian about getting a sedative like trazodone to help create down time during healing.
"
"While some sprains and strains are unavoidable because of underlying genetic predispositions, you can work to keep your dog safe by limiting their access to common sources of injury. Avoid letting them run on uneven or unfamiliar ground.
"
"Pay attention to your dog’s effort level during exercise and play. Most dogs will self-limit themselves and rest when they have had enough. However, sometimes they will ignore exhaustion when they are having a good time at a dog park or on another adventure. If your dog seems totally exhausted—they can't seem to stop panting or are straining to move—consider changing the pace. Take your dog for a slow walk and seek a change of scenery to bring their heart rate back down and allow them time to reconnect with their body to avoid overdoing it.
"
"Weight management can be very helpful in reducing injury risk. Overweight dogs that jump off  furniture or suddenly have rare bouts of high activity put more strain and force on their joints from the excessive weight, leading to breakdown and injury. Dogs at a healthy weight with regular exercise are much less likely to experience soft tissue injury. “Weekend warriors” is a good description not just for humans, but also for dogs that are relatively sedentary throughout the week, then go for long treks or extended periods of exercise on the weekend. These dogs are more susceptible to injury because their muscles and joints are not conditioned for regular, intense exercise.
"
"Sprains can often heal on their own with rest and time. As long as your dog is eating and drinking normally and has normal energy and otherwise acting like themselves, rest may be all they need. However, if your dog is not improving a little bit each day, or does not return to complete normal mobility in 10-14 days, it is important that they be checked by a veterinarian. Depending on the severity of the sprain, the injury may require more than just rest.

"
"Some breeds are likely more vulnerable because they lack hair or have light-colored fur or skin. It is unclear why some others are more susceptible. For example, a Rottweiler is more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma on their toes, despite their toes being relatively dark.
"
"Older dogs are more likely to be diagnosed with SCC than younger dogs. In a study of 17 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, the dogs ranged from 2 to 14 years old. Gender does not appear to be a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma. In the same study, there was a near equal split of males and females.
"
"Your dog’s veterinarian will need to examine the squamous cells in the tumor to make a diagnosis. These cells can be taken by a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or biopsy (removal of a small piece of tissue).
"
"FNA involves inserting a small needle into the tumor and taking a sample of cells. The sample is then looked at under a microscope. A biopsy is more involved, as it requires taking a piece of tissue from the tumor to be studied. Additional tests may be needed, depending on the results of these procedures.
"
"Squamous cell carcinoma grows slowly but may spread to local lymph nodes or the lungs (metastasize) if not treated. However, cancer in toes may grow faster than other areas of the body.
"
"Your veterinarian may perform tests to determine if the squamous cell carcinoma has spread to other parts of your dog’s body, particularly if it is present in the toes. This is called staging.
"
"Tests completed for staging can include radiographs (X-rays), ultrasounds, and analysis of your dog’s blood, urine, and lymph nodes.
"
"Surgery is the most recommended treatment option. The removal of a small skin lesion toward the surface of the skin that has not invaded nearby tissue can be a relatively routine surgery. Surgery that involves a large tumor or a tumor that has invaded nearby tissue is more invasive, and your veterinarian may need to replace lost skin tissue from another area of the body (skin grafting).

"Squamous cell carcinoma on toes may be treated by amputation of the affected digit only. Amputation of the foot or leg may be recommended in extreme cases for advanced cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma in the jaw that invades the jawbone may result in removal of part of the upper or lower jawbone (surgical procedures called maxillectomy or mandibulectomy).
"
"A mix of radiation and surgery may be suggested for your pup to ensure all diseased cells are destroyed. Like radiation, chemotherapy is also unlikely to be suggested on its own and should accompany your dog’s surgery. Not all dogs will be candidates for surgery. Some dogs may not be healthy enough to tolerate the anesthesia, or their tumors are inaccessible. Radiation, medication, and chemotherapy may be the only option in these situations. While they may not destroy all cancer cells, they can shrink tumors and prevent further growth.
"
"If your dog’s tumor is caught early, your veterinarian may decide to remove it with cryosurgery. This involves freezing and destroying the cancer cells with extreme cold. Another option for the removal of early squamous cell carcinoma is photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy uses drugs activated by light—known as a photosensitizer or photosensitizing agent—to destroy cancer cells.
"
"Yes, but it is best that activity be kept to a minimum when a dog is suffering from a sprain. Leash-walk only when your pet needs to go outdoors. Avoid letting them engage in any play activities that involve running, jumping, or rough housing. Utilize the kennel as much as possible during the rest period.

"Spondylosis deformans is a common degenerative disorder of the spinal column. It affects the vertebral bones of the spine and is characterized by the presence of bony spurs or osteophytes that form along the underside and on the edges of the spinal vertebrae. A bony growth can develop in a single spot on the spine or in multiple locations.
"
"In dogs, the most common area affected is the lumbar vertebrae, or lower back around the hips. Sometimes, the bony growths can be large enough that they appear to form a complete bridge from one vertebral bone to the next, fusing or linking the vertebrae together. This condition causes a noninflammatory, irreversible damage to the spinal vertebrae, which can result in loss of function and mobility issues.
"
"Spondylosis is most prevalent in large-breed dogs that are middle aged or older, but it can also occur in all breeds and sizes. Boxers are the most common breed affected. In most dogs, this degenerative condition will begin to develop by age 10. It is estimated that up to 70% of 9-year-old dogs are affected.
"
" 
"
"Most of the time, spondylosis does not produce any clinical signs. Some dogs may show signs of back pain in rare cases, as the bone spurs restrict movement of the spine and can put pressure on the nerves that come out of the spinal canal. Other symptoms may include:
"
"Vocalizing when specific areas of the back are touched or manipulated
"
"Hunched back stance, abnormal posture
"
"Reluctance to walk
"
"Lameness, limping  
"
"Trouble laying down and getting up comfortably
"
"Stiffness
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Lethargy, not acting like themselves
"
"Restricted motion, changes in flexibility 
"
"If your dog is exhibiting any of these clinical signs, have your pet examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"Spondylosis deformans is a degenerative condition of the vertebral bones, and it commonly develops in dogs as part of the natural aging process. It can also be caused by trauma (both small and major injury) or in those that have a genetic predisposition to bone spurs. Microtrauma over time can be caused by repetitive damage to the same joints and bones with repeated exercise or other activities, whereas major trauma can occur with a serious injury.
"
"Spondylosis develops secondary to a degenerative process of the soft disc material in between the vertebrae. The intervertebral discs act as shock absorbers to cushion, but when they become damaged it makes the joints in between the vertebral bones unstable, thus producing abnormal motion. In reaction to the abnormal joint movement, the bone spurs of spondylosis deformans develop to reestablish the stability of the weakened joint or joints. The bone spurs grow only as large as needed to reinforce the diseased joint.
"
"Spondylosis deformans is a condition of the spine that is commonly diagnosed when older animals are being examined for unrelated conditions. Your veterinarian will first take a complete history of your dog’s health and do a physical examination, including a neurologic and orthopedic exam to evaluate why your dog is exhibiting signs of back pain.
"
"Your vet may recommend blood work such as a biochemistry profile, complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to assess your dog’s overall health. Spondylosis deformans is diagnosed with imaging techniques, most commonly with x-rays of the spine, chest, and abdomen. The x-rays may reveal new bone growths, or osteophytes, along the vertebrae. In advanced cases, these osteophytes form a bridge from one vertebrae to the next.
"
"Other diagnostics, such as a myelogram (a special dye injected into the spinal fluid around the spinal cord, followed by x-rays) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are used to help evaluate your dog for other causes of back pain that might cause the secondary spondylosis to form. Both MRI and CT scans can show where a bone spur might be pressing on your dog’s spinal cord or nerves causing neurologic symptoms. Your primary veterinarian might need to refer you to a specialty hospital where a surgeon or neurologist can perform advanced diagnostics and treatments.
"
"In dogs, the spleen plays a role in the immune system, helping the body fight off infection and produce certain types of white blood cells. It also stores and produces new red blood cells and removes old red blood cells. At any given time, the spleen stores up to 20% of all the red blood cells and 30% of platelets in the body.
"
"The spleen is oblong shaped and located in the abdomen, below the stomach. While the spleen does play a role in keeping animals healthy, it is not a vital organ and can be removed with few long-lasting effects.
"
"Splenic tumors are very common in dogs, especially as they grow older. Because the spleen stores and produces red blood cells, even benign tumors may be at risk of rupture and bleeding, causing acute illness.
"
"Veterinarians class tumors as:
"
"Benign (non-cancerous)
"
"Malignant (cancerous)
"
"Primary (originated in the spleen) or secondary (spread from another tumor somewhere else)
"
"Focal (located in one area) or diffuse (spread throughout the entire organ)
"
"Hemangioma and hemangiosarcoma are two of the most common primary tumors found in spleens. Hemangiomas are benign, while hemangiosarcomas are malignant. The prognosis for any specific spleen tumor depends on the type of tumor. Benign tumors, which may still require treatment and removal, carry a better prognosis, or outcome, overall than malignant tumors, especially if treated early.
"
"The treatment for spondylosis deformans is directly related to the symptoms that your dog is displaying. If they are not displaying any clinical signs, no treatment is necessary. If your dog has pain or stiffness, conservative treatment is usually sufficient. This could include pain medication, controlled exercise or strict rest, and a weight loss regimen if your dog is overweight to reduce the amount of stress on the spine.
"
"Oral medications may consist of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) or other pain relievers such as tramadol or gabapentin. Physical therapy and acupuncture can also be helpful to regain strength and help with mobility. In rare cases, if the bone spurs are causing severe pain or significant neurologic issues, your veterinarian might recommend hospitalization and surgery.
"
"Although the prognosis is generally good, your veterinarian will discuss the prognosis for your dog based on diagnostic testing and/or their response to treatment. It’s important that you follow up with your veterinarian for check-ups to ensure that your dog’s pain is managed appropriately. This is a progressive condition, meaning that it can get worse as your dog ages but symptoms can be managed.
"
"If your dog does not show any symptoms, spondylosis deformans may go undetected for years or even for their lifetime. Most affected dogs live a long, full life with this condition, with the pain and lack of flexibility managed with long-term treatment if needed. Maintaining a weight loss plan and keeping your dog lean is extremely important. Since this condition affects older dogs who may be suffering from other causes of pain such as arthritis, you can support your dog by using soft bedding and a safe, quiet place for them to rest.
"
"Talking to your veterinarian about your dog’s diet is recommended to ensure they have an optimal balance of essential fatty acids, which have been proven to reduce inflammation and reduce the need for pain relief in pets. Ensure that your dog maintains a healthy weight, as being overweight can cause undue stress on the body, increasing pain. If your dog is overweight, discuss a nutrition plan with your veterinarian. Nutritional supplements such as glucosamine, methylsulphonylmethane (MSM), and chondroitin sulfate are great to help promote long-term joint health, even for joints in the spine.

"
"Any dog can develop tumors in their spleen, but older, larger breed dogs are at higher risk. Breeds most at risk include:
"
"German Shepherd
"
"Golden Retriever
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"Boxer
"
"Standard Poodle
"
"Bernese Mountain dog
"
"Flat-Coated Retriever
"
"Benign spleen tumors are non-cancerous but are easy to confuse with malignant tumors. When veterinarians find any tumor on the spleen, they may recommend additional tests to rule out more sinister diseases.  Benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body and do not pose a risk of metastasis. Many benign tumors may still be removed and can have a good prognosis, if they are caught early.
"
"While the prognosis for benign tumors is typically good if discovered early, the same is not true for malignant tumors. The outcome for malignant tumors varies based on how aggressive the cancer is. Common malignant tumors in the spleen include:
"
"Lymphoma or lymphosarcoma: This is a highly variable type of round cell tumor that typically involves the lymph nodes as well as other organs. Lymphoma is typically aggressive with a poor prognosis.
"
"Leukemia: Leukemia is typically a cancer of cells within the bone marrow, but can originate in or infiltrate the spleen. Canine leukemia is rare, but typically carries a poor prognosis with splenic involvement.
"
"Other round cell tumors include mast cell tumors, plasma cell tumors, and multiple myeloma. Prognosis varies with severity and metastasis but is generally guarded.
"
"Histiocytic sarcoma: This type of sarcoma is very common in Bernese Mountain Dogs, as well as other breeds. Prognosis is very poor to grave in most cases of histiocytic sarcoma.      
"
"As with all other types of splenic neoplasia, the type, aggressiveness, and location determine prognosis. There are many other less common types of malignant splenic tumors, mostly all carrying a similar poor prognosis, including:
"
"Leiomyosarcoma
"
"Melanoma
"
"Carcinoma
"
"Secondary tumors are also common in the spleen. These are caused by cancerous spread from other sites in the body. Because the spleen is very vascular, meaning it has a rich blood supply, it’s a common site for secondary tumors.
"
" 
"
"Signs of splenic tumors in dogs can be vague or even nonexistent, and they are often found during a diagnostic test for other conditions. A major concern of most tumors in the spleen is rupture. Because the spleen contains many blood vessels, even benign tumors have the potential to break open and cause either a slow or fast bleed. Slow bleeds will show more mild signs, while a fast bleed can result in an acute, severe, life-threatening blood loss into the abdomen.
"
"Common signs of a spleen tumor or bleeding include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Weakness
"
"Collapse
"
"Pale gums
"
"Abdominal enlargement (such as bloating or swollen abdomen)
"
"Cold limbs
"
"Heart arrhythmia
"
"The cause of most splenic tumors is unknown. German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Boxers, and Standard Poodles may have a higher risk of splenic tumors in general. Bernese Mountain Dogs and Flat-Coated Retrievers may have a genetic link to histiocytic sarcoma. Splenic cancer can occur in all ages of dogs, but veterinarians most often diagnose in older dogs.
"
"Veterinarians may suspect a bleeding splenic tumor based on clinical signs and physical exam alone. Large enough tumors can be felt (palpated) through the abdominal walls, and a fluid wave in the abdomen from bleeding is frequently present as well.
"
"Veterinarians will often recommend bloodwork as a first step to determine overall health after diagnosing a splenic tumor. A bleeding or ruptured tumor will often lead to anemia (low red blood cell count) and low platelets, which can be detected by a complete blood count. The blood chemistry panel may show issues common to many conditions, such as dehydration.
"
"Because low platelets and other factors necessary for clotting are common signs in some types of splenic tumors, coagulation tests will be done to determine if a dog is at risk for severe bleeding issues. This type of test (which includes prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times) measures how long it takes the blood to clot. Abnormal results could indicate the disease is more advanced and the patient is at risk for further bleeding. Coagulation tests may be performed if bleeding is suspected and can help guide treatment, such as blood product transfusions, that could increase survival during surgery.
"
"Radiographs, or x-rays, are useful to determine the overall size, shape, and placement of the spleen in reference to other abdominal organs. Veterinarians may note obvious masses in the spleen, or it may be generally enlarged and abnormally shaped. Veterinarians will also want to take x-rays of the lungs to look for cancerous spread.
"
"Ultrasonography allows more detailed analysis of the internal structure, location, and size of the spleen and other abdominal organs. Veterinarians will also use ultrasound as a guide when they obtain biopsies, which is one way to get a definitive diagnosis. Veterinary radiologists evaluate the entire abdominal cavity for other tumors, abnormalities, and fluid.
"
"Dogs with a ruptured splenic tumor commonly have abnormal fluid accumulation in the abdomen. Typically, this fluid is blood, and vets can easily obtain a sample by directing a needle into the abdominal fluid. Vets may analyze this fluid using a microscope to assess for cancerous cells. This method may be more helpful in diagnosing lymphoma and mast cell tumors but isn’t accurate in all cases.
"
"Splenic biopsy can be performed under ultrasound guidance with a large needle to collect a sample of spleen cells, as well as during surgical removal of the spleen.
"
"Regardless of whether a splenic tumor is malignant, removal of the spleen, called a splenectomy, is most often recommended as treatment for primary splenic tumors because even benign tumors can rupture and cause life-threatening illness.
"
"The surgery is relatively simple, and may not require a veterinary specialist to perform, as many general practitioners are comfortable. The spleen is not a vital organ, and therefore vets remove the entire spleen, not just the tumor.
"
"Before surgery, a complete work-up should be performed to look at overall health and cancer spread, called cancer staging. This may include bloodwork, x-rays of the chest and ultrasound of the abdomen. Based on the findings of these tests, vets will determine if a patient is a good surgical candidate for splenectomy.
"
"In the cases of advanced disease, cancerous spread, or poor surgical candidacy, surgery may not be recommended. However, there are cases of malignant tumors that may still benefit from a splenectomy.
"
"Veterinary oncologists typically recommend chemotherapy after removal of splenic tumors, based on the specific tumor type. In some cases, depending on the type of tumor, chemotherapy is not necessary.
"
"Medications are typically not a primary recommendation for dogs with splenic tumors. However, if a patient is not a candidate for surgery, medication may improve their quality of life. Dogs who do not have the spleen removed are still at risk of splenic rupture, and many vets utilize the Chinese herbal supplement Yunnan Baiyao to help control bleeding.
"
"Other medications, such as steroids, are prescribed in some types of cancer. Unfortunately, these medications do not cure anything and only make the dog’s quality of life better for a short period of time. 
"
"Prognosis of splenic cancer varies based on diagnosis. When caught early, benign tumors, most notably hematomas and other vascular tumors, may only require a splenectomy to prevent a rupture and hemorrhage. If the tumor was found coincidentally, and the pet is not actively sick, the prognosis may be excellent with full life expectancy.
"
"Patients who have concurrent illnesses, or if benign tumors chronically or acutely rupture, can also have clotting and anemia issues and may have a more guarded prognosis.
"
"Malignant tumors carry a more guarded to grave prognosis.  Many dogs are not stable enough to undergo anesthesia due to the changes in blood and coagulation factors. Because of this, many dogs undergoing an emergency splenectomy pass away or are euthanized during surgery.
"
"Survival times after a splenectomy range from less than month to up to three months for dogs with splenic hemangiosarcoma (one of the most severe malignant tumors). Dogs treated with a splenectomy and chemotherapy may have a longer survival time depending on their individual case. However, there are many complicating factors involving specific diagnosis, stage, and metastatic rates.
"
"Dogs who receive no treatment of malignant, bleeding splenic tumors have an extremely dire prognosis. Tumors can bleed slowly, with the dog showing varying signs of illness and weakness. Tumors can also rupture acutely and traumatically. These dogs are critically sick, weak, and can die from loss of blood. These patients should be immediately evaluated by a veterinarian to determine if surgery is still an option or if humane euthanasia is the best choice.
"
"Dogs with their spleen removed require normal postoperative care including incisional monitoring and routine pain management. They will likely have an incision from the sternum down to the pelvis. These patients should have decreased activity and incision monitoring for at least 10-14 days.
"
"All splenic tumors should be biopsied for a definitive diagnosis. Surgery may be curative for benign tumors with no other illnesses or complications.
"
"For those patients with more advanced disease, rechecks with surgeons and oncologists may be scheduled initially at 2 weeks, and then every 1-3 months depending on the plan going forward. The veterinarians will likely check bloodwork parameters, x-rays, and ultrasounds at these visits to monitor disease progression and quality of life.
"
"Based on the severity of the disease, some complications may require more intensive care and monitoring such as:
"
"Continued hemorrhage and loss of blood
"
"Heart arrhythmias
"
"Blood transfusions from coagulation issues
"
"Blood transfusions from blood loss
"
"Low blood pressure secondary to blood loss
"
"Nutritional support
"
"Depending on the type and severity, dogs with splenic cancer may live for weeks to months.
"
"Dogs with splenic cancer are at high risk of loss of blood from a bleeding tumor, especially those with hemangiosarcoma.
"
"Dogs may be in pain, especially if the tumor ruptures. Occasionally they are asymptomatic.
"
"Some types of splenic cancer is curable with surgery and chemotherapy.

"""Spinal Dysraphism"" is a broad term encompassing developmental disorders of spinal cord leading to various structural defects. It may be progressive or non-progressive in nature. Spinal Dysraphism has been reported in English bulldogs, Samoyeds, Dalmatians, English setters, golden retrievers, rottweilers and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.
"
"Often, spinal dysraphism is due to spinal cord damage due to infection, trauma, or tumor(s). Genetics is also a factor, especially in weimaraners.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which may be normal.
"
"X-rays may reveal abnormalities related to vertebral column and spinal cord compression in some patients.
"
"
"
"Those with mild symptoms may require little treatment, whereas more severe cases may require the use of canine carts to assist mobility. Surgical intervention may also help in arresting the progression or improve the course by slowing the progression of neurological symptoms.
"
"In case of urinary infections, antibiotics are used to control infections. Drugs, meanwhile, are used to reduce cerebrospinal fluid or CSF pressure in brain and spinal cord.
"
"Maintaining the quality of life is important in dogs suffering from spinal dysraphism. Other concerns include secondary urinary tract infections, which benefit from antibiotic therapy, and constant turning of dogs that remain flat. This will help prevent ulcers and urine and fecal scalds.
"
"If the dog shows little response to treatment, or in cases of advanced disease, your veterinarian may recommend euthanasia.

"Dogs most often genetically inherit congenital spinal and vertebral malformations (as opposed to adverse conditions during fetal development). Specifically, sacrococcygeal dysgenesis (defective development) is a dominant trait, while thoracic hemivertebra (chest half-vertebra) of German shorthaired pointers is a recessive trait.
"
"Spinal malformations are usually evident at birth or in the first few weeks of life. On the other hand, vertebral malformations can be latent until the dog undergoes a growth spurt around five to nine months of age. Visible signs of a distorted spinal column are lordosis (curvature of the spine at the lower back) and kyphosis (a posterior curvature of the spine).
"
"Scoliosis (a lateral curvature of the spine) is also an easily visible form of vertebral malformation. If the malformations lead to secondary spinal cord compression and trauma, the affected dog will display ataxia and paresis. Medicine often does not resolve neurological manifestations of spinal and vertebral malformations. If the condition is severe and untreatable, euthanasia should be considered.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. A full physical exam will be performed. X-rays of the spinal column (including all vertebrae) can often reveal the exact malformation. If neurological signs (paralysis) are present, a myelography can be used to indicate with precision at which level the spinal cord is compressed. This imaging technique uses a radiopaque substance that is injected into the spine, or into the membranous space that surrounds the spinal cord so that the defects in the spine will be visible on X-ray projections.
"
"Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be helpful, and are in some cases much more sensitive than X-rays. However, myelography is generally the diagnostic imaging technique of choice.
"
"
"
"Surgery can be helpful for cases involving narrowing of the spinal canal and decompression of the spinal cord. Secondary damage due to spinal compression may be avoided if surgical intervention takes place early on. If the spinal compression is diffuse or long-term, your dog may not respond to surgery. If your dog is showing neurological signs such as dizziness, seizures or paralysis postoperatively, restricted activity combined with physical therapy may be helpful.

"Teeth discoloration is any variation from normal tooth color. However, the normal color of teeth varies, dependent on the shade, thickness, and translucency of the enamel covering the tooth.
"
"Any variation from normal tooth color is discoloration. The normal color of teeth varies, dependent on the shade, thickness and translucency of the enamel covering the tooth. Extrinsic discoloration occurs when exogenous pigment accumulates on the surface of teeth. That is, the cause of the discoloration is from an external source, rather than from a physical condition. Intrinsic discoloration is characterized by secondary factors that are happening inside the tooth, discoloring the underlying dentin.

"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible conditions that might have caused this condition, such as diet, injury, recent illnesses, etc. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues to the origin of the dental condition.
"
"An oral exam is part of a thorough physical exam. Your veterinarian will need to x-ray your dog's teeth in order to identify internal or external resorption, and whether restorative materials or bacterial stain from bacteria are entering the crown of the teeth. Your veterinarian may also use a strong fiber optic light that is focused on the teeth to determine vital from dead dental pulp (the nerves and blood vessels in the tooth). If the tooth (or teeth) need to be removed, your veterinarian will most likely need to subdue your dog with general anesthetize in order to extract it.
"
"
"
"Extrinsic stain removal can be performed for cosmetic reasons. These procedures often involve internal and/or external treatments such as bleaching, veneers and crowns.

"Spasm of the rear legs in dogs—also called dancing Doberman syndrome because it mostly affects Doberman Pinschers—is a neuromuscular condition that causes uncontrolled flexing of the hip and of the stifle joint (similar to a human’s knee) while the dog is standing. The disease is not well understood, but it has the following characteristics:
"
"In the early stages, a dog can usually walk and run normally but will begin to have spasms when standing. Some affected dogs will prefer sitting or lying down to standing. 
"
"The dog will appear to be dancing but is actually alternately flexing and extending his rear legs.
"
"Though the spasms may start with one leg, they usually progress to both rear legs within months. The front legs aren’t affected.
"
"This condition slowly progresses to muscle weakness, knuckling of the back paws (walking on the knuckles or top of the foot), and wasting (atrophy) of the muscles in the back legs.
"
"It affects dogs, both male and female, between the ages of 6 months and 7 years old. 
"
"Dancing Doberman disease can resemble many other diseases and conditions, including:
"
"Arthritis
"
"Hip dysplasia
"
"Intervertebral disc disease
"
"Wobbler syndrome
"
"Other nerve-related medical conditions
"
"A spermatocele is a cyst in the ducts or epididymis that conduct sperm, and is usually associated with a blockage. Meanwhile, sperm granuloma (or cyst epididymis) is a chronic inflammatory condition in which a cyst has grown in the epididymis, part of the spermatic duct system, resulting in swelling of the duct or ducts. When sperm escape from these ducts into the surrounding tissue, chronic inflammation occurs. This becomes clinically important when bilateral (both sides) obstruction of the duct system leads to no live sperm in the seminal fluid.
"
"It is suspected in dogs that have no live sperm yet have normal-sized testes. In addition, it is rarely associated with pain or visible or palpable lesions.
"
"In making a determination about why your dog’s sperm is deficient, your veterinarian will look at several possibilities, such a testicular degeneration, underdevelopment of the organs, insufficient ejaculation, and incomplete ejaculation. A physical examination will be conducted to look for pain or lesions in the reproductive organs. A urinalysis and possibly a blood test will also be standard for laboratory analysis. It may also be necessary to conduct a surgical testicular biopsy and a biopsy of affected the epididymal tissue to differentiate a benign from a malignant mass.
"
"
"
"Dogs with insufficient sperm counts rarely spontaneously recover. A bilateral blockage of the epididymis is generally not treatable except by surgical intervention.

"Intrinsic stain removal may be done to improve the function of the teeth and to relieve pain for your dog. This often involves using endodontic treatment (endodontics treat the interior of the tooth, pulp and surrounding tissue of the teeth). Crowns and veneers may be used to protect the teeth and the pulp in the teeth.
"
"Any discolored teeth should be treated to prevent plaque and calculus buildup and to prevent further periodontal disease. Discolored teeth are more prone to fracture, which could result in tooth abscessation (formation of an abscess, usually in response to bacterial infection).
"
"Discoloration may be prevented in future litters by avoiding giving certain medications to the pregnant bitch. With proper attention, discoloration of teeth can be prevented in puppies.

"The major difference is that, with dancing Doberman disease, the dog does not seem to be in any pain.
"
"Symptoms associated with dancing Doberman may include: 
"
"Spasm of the muscles in the rear legs
"
"Flexing and extending of one or both of the rear legs
"
"Holding up a rear leg
"
"Shifting back and forth on rear legs
"
"Knuckling over of rear paws
"
"Atrophy (muscle wasting) of the affected leg or legs
"
"Weakness in the back legs
"
"Preference for sitting or lying down instead of standing
"
"Collapse of the rear end with advanced weakness
"
"Not much is known at this point about the causes of the disease. There may be a genetic connection, but that has not been proven.
"
"Diagnosing dancing Doberman disease can be difficult and frustrating since most diagnostic tests will have normal results. Vets usually make the diagnosis based on:
"
"History
"
"Clinical signs
"
"Physical examination
"
"Ruling out other diseases that may look similar
"
"Bloodwork, which can sometimes reveal elevations in such muscle enzymes as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine kinase (CK)
"
"X-rays, MRI, and/or myelogram to rule out similar-looking neurologic and orthopedic conditions
"
"Electromyography (EMG) and histopathology (biopsy) of the muscle and nerves. During an EMG, electrical currents are sent to the muscles, and returning signals from the nerves are recorded.
"
"Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment or cure for dancing Doberman disease. Physical therapy may be attempted to maintain muscle mass, flexibility, and range of motion. The therapy may include:
"
"Massage
"
"Swimming
"
"Hydrotherapy
"
"Passive range of motion (PROM) exercises
"
"Laser therapy (cold and hot)
"
"Acupuncture
"
"The last two are currently being tested in the treatment of this condition, and the results are not yet in.
"
"The disease progresses slowly, but quality of life and life expectancy are not usually affected. Physical therapy and joint supplements should be considered for the rest of the dog’s life to avoid other bone- and joint-related issues.
"
"Electrolyte imbalances, toxin ingestion, neurologic issues (which include dancing Doberman disease), orthopedic issues, and/or neuromuscular issues can all cause muscle spasms in your dog’s rear legs. Your vet will need to rule out possible medical conditions before diagnosing dancing Doberman disease.
"
"Dogs with dancing Doberman disease do not seem to be in any pain. Some experts believe these dogs feel a “pins and needles” or a burning sensation down their legs, which is what causes them to shift their weight (similar to restless leg syndrome in people), but this has not been proven.
"
"There is no cure for dancing Doberman disease, and there is no effective treatment. The good news is that there is no obvious pain associated with this condition, so there is little to no change in quality of life.

"A dog’s backbone (spinal column) is made up of many smaller bones called vertebrae, which are connected by spongy intervertebral discs. Together, they allow movement and protect the spinal cord. 
"
"Spina bifida is a congenital defect (present at birth) that occurs when the upper portions of these vertebrae fail to close. This leaves the membranes that cover the spinal cord, or the spinal cord itself, exposed. This defect can cause a wide range of neurological problems ranging in severity such as the inability to walk, urinate, or defecate.
"
"Fortunately, this condition is relatively rare in dogs. When it occurs, it usually affects the lower lumbar spine. Spina bifida often occurs with other neurological conditions and most often is apparent in the first few weeks of life when puppies learn to walk. Sadly, because most of these puppies have a poor prognosis of a functional life, many of them are humanely euthanized. For the few that are not significantly impacted by the defect or have minor symptoms, they can go on to live a relatively normal life with minor inconveniences to the pet parent. 
"
"Symptoms of this condition include:
"
"Weakness of the rear limbs
"
"Urinary and/or fecal incontinence
"
"Poor muscle tone
"
"Poor use of the tail (lack of wagging or weakness in tail movements)
"
"Abnormal reflexes
"
"Lack of pain perception
"
"Knuckling of the toes
"
"Bunny hopping or abnormal gait
"
"Hyperesthesia (increased sensation) and pain
"
"Additionally, dogs may have a dimple (a small external visible depression) along the spine, which often is painful when touched.  Some dogs, depending on the severity of spina bifida, may have few symptoms or neurological deficits that aren’t detrimental to their long-term well-being.
"
"Spina bifida occurs when tissues do not form properly within the womb. The exact reason this happens is unknown, but it could be associated with several factors such as exposure to toxins or certain environmental conditions while the mother is pregnant. 
"
"Other congenital defects often occur with spina bifida, such as:
"
"Meningomyelocele (protrusion of the meninges and/or spinal cord with or without fluid pockets)
"
"Hemi or block vertebrae (abnormally shaped vertebrae)
"
"Hydrocephalus (excess fluid in the skull, causing brain swelling)
"
"Dermoid sinus (tubular sac arising from the skin and extending to deeper tissues)
"
"The English Bulldog is the breed most affected by this condition, but it has also been seen in Collies, English Cocker Spaniels, French Bulldogs, Boston Terriers, Miniature Poodles, Chihuahuas, and Dobermans. Males seem to be affected more than females.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend basic blood work like a complete blood cell count (CBC), internal organ function screening, and a urinalysis. The results from these tests provide a baseline and can also help rule out other conditions. X-rays are often recommended as a next step and can help identify related conditions.
"
"Pet parents most likely will be referred to a veterinary neurologist for an MRI, which is the standard test for this condition. A CT scan and a CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) tap may also be recommended and performed with this specialist.  
"
"If unable to perform these tests due to no MRI available or the cost, your veterinarian may perform a myelogram, in which contrast dye is injected into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord. This test is not without risks for dogs with certain health conditions and requires anesthesia.
"
"Unfortunately, this condition is lifelong and carries a heavy burden on the pet parent, with limited quality of life for the dog. Euthanasia is often chosen. Surgery cannot cure spina bifida in dogs, but it can alleviate some symptoms and make a dog more comfortable. Surgery will be pursued if symptoms are mild and the dog is in good health.
"
"Dogs with less severe symptoms are often more prone to urinary tract infections, skin infections, and muscle atrophy, so frequent follow-up visits and rechecks are still necessary. Dogs often require medication to help with manual expression of the bladder.
"
"The three goals of treatment for this condition are: improvement in neurologic deficits, enhanced bladder and bowel function, and better movement. Consistent grooming habits, bathing, and hygiene care are needed and even a doggy wheelchair or similar device may be required for improved mobility. 
"
"When surgery is an option for a dog, the recovery is often lengthy and requires rehabilitation and physical therapy. Several days of hospitalization are needed and physical therapy can last several weeks to months.
"
"Partnering with your veterinarian, particularly if they are a member of the American Association of Rehabilitation Veterinarians, to get an individualized treatment plan is advised. Acupuncture, laser therapy, and massage could be additional post-surgical therapies. 
"
"Long-term care depends on the symptoms, and many dogs require some form of nursing care.  Again, physical therapy coupled with pain medications or NSAIDs when needed will be vital to improve your dog’s strength and mobility while limiting or preventing muscle atrophy. Toe-grips for traction, rugs, a harness, or a wheelchair are all tools that can help your dog remain mobile and enjoy a better quality of life. 
"
"Joint supplements such as Cosequin®, Dasuquin®, and Welactin®, among others, as well as feeding your dog a well-balanced high-quality food, can reduce inflammation and support joint health.  Maintaining proper grooming habits and the use of doggie diapers and pads can be helpful if they are changed frequently, and the skin should be inspected for signs of infection and urine scalding. 
"
"Depending on the severity of symptoms experienced, some dogs can have a relatively normal life.  However, many dogs with spina bifida have little to no control over their hind limbs or control of their urinary and fecal habits. In these cases, euthanasia is often chosen.  
"
"There is no cure for this condition and dogs usually require some form of life-long extensive management. Depending on severity, however, some dogs can have a functional life and committed pet parents can ensure their lives are filled with joy and dignity.

"Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a general term for tumors that can occur in the soft and connective tissues of the body. Examples of soft and connective tissue include muscles, nerves, tendons, blood vessels, and fat.
"
"Tumors that start in soft and connective tissue can be non-cancerous (benign), but those that belong to the soft tissue sarcoma group are cancerous (malignant).
"
"Soft tissue sarcoma can occur almost anywhere because soft and connective tissues are found throughout the body. However, it most commonly occurs in the skin and layers of tissue just below the skin. They make up 8 to 15% of all tumors in dogs that occur in these areas, and most grow slowly.
"
"Soft tissue sarcoma tumors are graded on a scale of 1 to 3:
"
"Grade 1 (low): Most cases of soft tissue sarcoma in dogs are Grade 1. They rarely spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body or invade neighboring tissues.
"
"Grade 2 (intermediate): Grade 2 is the second most common diagnosed grade for soft tissue sarcoma. They similarly do not typically spread to or invade other parts of the body.
"
"Grade 3 (high): Only 7 to 17% of soft tissue sarcoma cases are Grade 3. Likelihoods of recurrence and metastasis are higher than in Grades 1 and 2, and Grade 3 soft tissue sarcoma will spread in 40 to 50% of cases diagnosed.
"
"Staging is determined by rating three primary factors:
"
"How different the cancerous cells look and act in comparisons with healthy cells.
"
"How many of the tumor’s cells are dividing, which helps to determine how fast the tumor is growing.
"
"How many of the tumor’s cells are dying. Cell death (apoptosis) is a normal process for all cells, but cancerous cells often find ways to evade it so that the tumor can continue to grow.
"
"Signs of soft tissue sarcomas depend on the location of the tumor in your dog’s body.
"
"Some common areas include:
"
"Tumors arising from muscle tissue: Your dog may exhibits signs of pain (yelping, pulling away) when touching the affected area and may have a visible and firm mass.
"
"Tumors on the legs, which may interfere with walking and cause limping or limited mobility.
"
"Tumors in the abdomen, which may result in vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, or decreased appetite.
"
"Tumors arising from nervous tissue, which may cause pain, lameness, muscle atrophy, and paralysis.
"
"Tumors in the mouth, which may result in bad breath, trouble eating, or decreased appetite.
"
"Tumors affecting the reproductive organs (such as the prostate), which may result in difficulty urinating or defecating.
"
"There is no single known cause for the development of soft tissue sarcoma. Research suggests that factors such as genetics, age, environment, hormones, body size, previous physical trauma to the body, and chronic inflammation can all play a role.
"
"Dog breeds that are disproportionately diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma are all larger in size and include the Airedale Terrier, Basset Hound, Bernese Mountain Dog, Boxer, Great Dane, and Saint Bernard.
"
"As is the case for most tumor types, older dogs are more likely to develop soft tissue sarcoma than younger dogs.
"
"Not all lumps and bumps are cause for concern, but they should all be checked out by your veterinarian. They will need to perform diagnostic testing to determine whether the lump is soft tissue sarcoma. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is the most common test used, where a small needle with a syringe is inserted into the mass and extracts a sample of cells to view under a microscope.
"
"A biopsy may be needed if diagnostic testing from an FNA is not definitive (or allows the veterinarian to determine whether the cells are cancerous or not). A biopsy is more invasive than FNA because it involves cutting off a piece of tumor. It can reveal more information about the tumor, such as how quickly it’s growing, its stage, and what treatment approach may be most suitable. Biopsies typically involve the use of a local anesthetic to keep your dog still and comfortable.
"
"Depending on the results, additional testing such as chest X-rays or abdominal ultrasound may be recommended to see if the cancer has spread. An analysis of cells and certain chemicals in your dog’s blood, as well as the examination of your dog’s urine, may also be recommended. In some cases, additional imaging such as a computed tomography (CT) may be advised. 
"
"Treatment will depend on the type of tumor, its size and location, and the overall health of your dog. Your veterinarian will work with you to determine the best treatment plan for your pet.  Surgery is the most common treatment for soft tissue sarcoma. It is the most likely option to completely remove the tumor, has the fewest negative side effects, and is the cheapest treatment choice in the long term.
"
"Grade 1 tumors are typically good candidates for surgery and rarely recur if completely removed. Grade 2 tumors are also often good candidates for surgery and similarly have a low likelihood of recurrence if completely removed. Depending on the location and grade, your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary surgeon or oncologist to help determine the best approach for your pet. 
"
"Soft tissue sarcoma is unique in that these tumors have arm-like structures that extend outward. This makes the removal of the entire tumor challenging. Follow-up surgeries or radiation therapy may be necessary to ensure that all parts of the tumor are destroyed.
"
"Surgery may not be an option for some cases of soft tissue sarcoma because the tumor is too large or cannot be reached. Radiation is often advised in these situations. Radiation is rarely able to destroy the entire tumor, but it can slow down its growth.
"
"Chemotherapy may be advised as part of your dog’s treatment plan either alone or with surgery or radiation. Chemotherapy is most often suggested for dogs with Grade III soft tissue sarcoma because of its increased ability to spread to other parts of the body.
"
"The prognosis for Grade 1 or 2 soft tissue sarcoma is excellent with surgery. Recurrence after surgery occurs in 7% to 30% of cases and may be further improved with the addition of radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.
"
"Pet parents of dogs with a history of soft tissue sarcoma can have follow-up appointments for at least two years after surgery.
"
"Dogs with cases of Grade 1 or 2 soft tissue sarcomas that can be surgically removed have a good to excellent prognosis. Grade 3 soft tissue sarcoma has a more guarded prognosis.
"
"Soft tissue sarcoma is usually not painful. Soft tissue sarcomas are commonly caught early due to their visible nature, and they can be treated. More advanced soft tissue sarcomas toward the surface of the skin may cause the skin to break open, which can be painful.
"
"Soft tissue sarcomas are typically slow-growing, although some can develop in just a few weeks. Lower-grade soft tissue sarcoma is unlikely to spread to other parts of the body.

"Rhabdomyosarcomas are malignant, aggressive, easily metastasizing (spreading) tumors. They arise from striated muscles (banded - not smooth, muscles of the skeletal and cardiac musculature) in adults, and from embryonic stem cells in juveniles. These tumors are often found in the larynx (voice box), the tongue, and in the heart. Aggressive and widespread metastasizing can occur in the lungs, the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, and the adrenal glands.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. While a cytologic (microscopic) examination of a fine-needle aspirate sample may reveal cancer, a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a surgical biopsy (tissue sample).
"
"
"
"Surgical removal of the tumors, or nodules, should be performed if a cure is desired, but because of the invasive and expansive nature of this tumor, it may not be removable by surgery. If one limb is primarily affected, amputation of the affected limb should be considered. Radiotherapy may be helpful, particularly if the tumor was not entirely removable.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up appointment once a month for the first three months following the initial treatment. Subsequent appointments can then be scheduled every three to six months. If your dog undergoes surgery to have a tumor removed, you will need to closely observe the surgical site every day until it has healed entirely. Your doctor will instruct you in the proper cleaning and dressing techniques for the sutured site. You will need to contact your veterinarian immediately if you see oozing, drainage, swelling, or redness from the surgical site. If you have any questions, contact your veterinarian immediately.

"Hyponatremia is the clinical term given to a condition in which a dog is suffering from low concentrations of serum sodium in the blood. As a component of the extracellular fluid (fluids outside of the cells), sodium is the most abundant positive charged atom in the body. For this reason, a condition of hyponatremia usually reflects a concurrent condition of hyposmolality, an underconcentration of osmotic solution in the blood serum; that is, a lack in the ability of body fluids to pass through the cellular membranes (osmosis), by which the body's chemical concentrations are kept in balance. Hyposmolality is typically associated with a decreased amount of sodium content throughout the body.
"
"Theoretically, hyponatremia can be caused by either water retention or solute loss (loss of a dissolvable body substance -- in this case, salt/sodium is the solute). Most solute loss occurs in iso-osmotic solutions (e.g., vomit and diarrhea), and as a result, water retention in relation to solute is the underlying cause in almost all patients that are diagnosed with hyponatremia. In general, hyponatremia occurs only when there is a defect in the kidney's ability to excrete water.
"
"Normal osmolar hyponatremia, causes with typical concurrent conditions:
"
"Hyperglycemia – excessive glucose/sugar in the blood
"
"Primary polydipsia – excessive thirst
"
"Congestive heart failure (CHF)
"
"Gastrointestinal losses
"
"  
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical  blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte  panel. If your dog has hyponatremia, these tests will confirm low serum  sodium concentration. Other disorders that can mimic hyponatremia, and  which will need to be  excluded, are hyperglycemia, hyperproteinemia, and hyperlipidemia.
"
"Your  veterinarian may also recommend testing the serum osmolality will  be tested. The osmolality balance of your dog's urine will be  indicative of the kidney's ability to excrete water, and the sodium  concentration found in the urine may indicate a low volume of  circulating sodium.
"
"
"
"Primary treatment will depend on the severity of the hyponatremia, and the associated neurological symptoms. The severity of any underlying disorders will guide treatment priorities as well. Treatment generally consists of addressing the underlying cause, and increasing the serum sodium concentration if necessary.
"
"Overly rapid normalization of the hyponatremia can have potentially severe neurological results, and may be more detrimental than the hyponatremia itself. Therefore, an isotonic saline is the fluid of choice in the large majority of cases. More aggressive correction of the serum sodium concentration with hypertonic saline is rarely necessary. Hypervolemic patients (patients with too much fluid in the blood) are typically managed with diuretics (fluid reducers) and salt restriction.
"
"Conversely, hypovolemic patients (patients with too little fluid in the blood) are managed by replacing the volume deficit with isotonic saline. Other therapeutic interventions are dictated by the underlying cause of the hyponatremia.
"
"Initially, your veterinarian will need to observe your dog's response to treatment, repeating serum sodium determinations in order to avoid overly rapid correction of the serum sodium concentrations, and to assure an appropriate response to sodium and other indicated therapies. In addition, your doctor will want to monitor your dog's hydration status and other serum electrolyte concentrations, as indicated by your dog's clinical condition and underlying disorder.

"Teratozoospermia is a morphological (referring to form and structure) reproductive disorder characterized by the presence of spermatozoal abnormalities. That is, 40 percent or more of the sperm are abnormally shaped. The sperm may have short or curled tails, double heads, or head that are too large, too small, or badly shaped.
"
"The effect of specific abnormalities on fertility is largely unknown, but optimal fertility is expected in dogs that have at least 80 percent morphologically normal spermatozoa. Therefore, it is known that it is nearly impossible for sperm that are abnormally shaped to fertilize an egg.
"
"This condition can affect dogs of any age, but older dogs are more likely to have other age-related diseases or conditions that affect overall sperm quality. There is no breed predilection, however, Irish wolfhounds have been reported to have significantly lower semen quality than dogs of other breeds.
"
"Spermatozoal abnormalities are sometimes classified into primary and secondary defects. Primary defects occur during spermatogenesis, the development stage, and secondary defects occur during transport and storage within the epididymis (part of the spermatic duct system). Often there are no outward symptoms of this disorder. The most obvious symptom makes itself apparent in the breeding dog, when the male dog fails to impregnate a breeding partner.
"
"Congenital
"
"Acquired
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, along with any possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as trauma, infection, or travel (as other climates, especially hot climates, may have played a role).
"
"A history of your dog’s infertility will help your veterinarian to make a diagnosis. For example, has he been infertile after appropriately timed mating to several reproductively-proven bitches? Have spermatozoal abnormalities been found during routine breeding soundness evaluation? Your veterinarian will probably do a hormonal profile as well as an examination of the ejaculates (the sperm cells). Your doctor will also test for bacterial infections, and may use visual diagnostic tools to examine the reproductive tract. An ultrasound examination may show whether there is a blockage, orchitis (inflammation of the testis), hydrocele, hemorrhage into a cavity, cyst of the epididymus, or tumor in the testicular region that is affecting the sperm ducts and sperm morphology.
"
"
"
"There is no a specific treatment for spermatozoal abnormalities; if applicable, the underlying disease or condition will be treated. Antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents will be prescribed for infectious diseases and swelling due to inflammation. Unilateral surgical removal may be recommended for unilateral testicular tumors or severe orchitis. Your veterinarian may recommend sexual rest for edema (swelling) or for a cyst associated with trauma. Frequent semen collection may temporarily improve sperm quality in dogs with idiopathic teratozoospermia, but the quality of the sperm will have to be tested before it is used for breeding purposes, to avoid genetic abnormalities resulting from poor sperm. If your dog is in an extremely hot environment, or it is the summer season, protect your dog from high ambient temperatures by moving him to a cooler space. In addition, alter your dog’s exercise program to reduce heat stress, unless your veterinarian has specifically ordered more exercise for treatment of obesity.
"
"It may help to provide a climate-controlled environment for your dog if it is not adapted to high environmental temperatures. Also, avoid heat exhaustion during exercise or grooming (e.g., drying cages).
"
"If an underlying cause is identified and treated, your veterinarian will want to perform a sperm evaluation at 30 and 60 days after the condition is resolved. In cases due to reversible causes, a complete improvement in sperm morphology does not usually occur before 60 days -- the approximate length of a complete spermatogenic cycle.

"In smoke inhalation, injury occurs as a result of direct heat damage to the upper airway and lining of the nose. Injury to the tissue is seen after inhalation of carbon monoxide, which decreases tissue oxygen delivery by binding to red blood cells; inhalation of other toxins that directly irritate the airway (e.g., oxidants and aldehydes); and inhalation of particulate matter that adheres to the airways and small air sacs in the lungs.
"
"The extent of damage depends on the degree and duration of exposure to smoke and the material that was burning. Dogs may have serious lung injury with little evidence of burning on their skin. Lung reaction is initially symptomized by constriction of the lungs, airway swelling, and mucus production, followed by an inflammatory response in the trachea and bronchial area, and fluid accumulation in the lungs. Most patients show progression of lung dysfunction in the initial two to three days after exposure. Follow-up bacterial infections are a common cause of death late in the disease due to the wounded tissue being an advantageous receptor for bacteria.
"
"Exposure to smoke/carbon monoxide, usually the result of being trapped in a burning building.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as exposure to burning material. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The blood count will show the level of red blood cells that are capable of carrying oxygen, and white cells that are capable of fighting infection. The blood profile will also show whether the arterial blood gases are at normal levels and will show the degree of oxygen shortage in the blood. The urinalysis will show how the kidney is functioning. Visual diagnostics, such as X-ray and ultrasound, may also be used to determine if there is fluid buildup in the lungs. A bronchoscopy, which uses a flexible tube with a camera attached and which can be inserted into the airway, may allow your doctor to determine the severity of airway damage.
"
"Samples will be taken of the cells inside the mouth and in the airways and cultured to determine whether there are bacteria present. If there is tissue damage to the airways, your veterinarian may prescribe a prophylactic antibiotic to prevent infection.
"
"
"
"At the outset, stabilization of the respiratory function and establishment of an effective airway will be the most important. Severe upper airway swelling or obstruction may require intubation or an operation to make an opening in the trachea.
"
"Oxygen should be administered immediately after rescue from the fire to displace carbon monoxide from hemoglobin (the oxygen carrying pigment of the blood). It will be delivered by mask, hood, oxygen cage, or nasal line. After elimination of carbon monoxide, oxygen supplementation will be continued at 40 to 60 percent as needed. Fluid administration may be required in patients with shock to support cardiovascular function but should be conservative, if possible, to minimize a buildup of fluid in the chest. Blood or plasma transfusions may be necessary to add fresh red and white blood cells to the blood stream. Nutritional support may be needed to maintain body condition and immune status.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to carefully monitor your dog’s respiratory rate and effort, mucous membrane color, heart rate and pulse quality, the sound of the lungs, packed cell volume of the blood and total solids for 24 to 72 hours. X-rays will be repeated 48 hours after the initial treatment to ensure that the condition is resolving, and your doctor will also want to monitor your dog’s system for bacterial pneumonia, which is often a side-effect of damage to the lung tissue. Most patients will have some level of deterioration during the initial 24 to 48 hours after smoke exposure and then gradually improve, unless they develop bacterial pneumonia or acute respiratory response syndrome. Severe burns or organ injury are associated with a poor prognosis.

"Smaller than normal testes are generally easy to spot. There are different conditions that can lead to this disorder: underdevelopment or incomplete development of the testes is known as hypoplasia, an inability to grow and/or mature appropriately; and degeneration of the testes, which refers to the loss of potency after the stage of puberty has arrived.
"
"Both of these conditions can be due to a condition that was present at birth -- congenital -- or can be due to some other cause that takes place after birth. The congenital forms are  usually related to genetic abnormalities that have been inherited by the parent, but may also be due to something that occurred while the puppy was in utero, such as exposure to radioactive substances.
"
"Dogs of any age or breed are predisposed to these conditions, but hypoplasia is most commonly seen in young dogs, and degeneration is more common in older dogs.
"
"In addition to abnormally small testes, infertility is the single most common symptom of these conditions. Semen analysis will show a low sperm count (oligospermia) or an absolute absence of sperms (azoospermia) in the seminal fluid is usually reported.
"
"Dogs with these conditions are typically presented to their veterinarians with a compliant of infertility. You will need to give a complete known history, including any such problems that were present in the previous generations of your dog's familial line and any trauma or injury that may have affected your dog's scrotum.
"
"Skin tags are small abnormal growths of skin. As the name suggests, they are skin that has grown differently than normal skin and are usually located on the chest, legs, and neck. Skin tags are not considered an emergency, but having your veterinarian examine them on their next annual visit is always recommended. You can also make a “skin journal” with location and size to help you remember before your next veterinarian visit.
"
"Skin tags are usually not noticed until they are felt while petting or bathing your dog. Skin tags are very small pieces of skin attached by a small stalk-like structure. They are usually only a few millimeters in size, moveable, and not painful. They can be ether pink or darker in color. They can also occur alone or in a group.
"
"Ticks, masses, warts, and cysts can look like skin tags but they are different.
"
"A tick might be tricky to confirm; if you do not notice legs extending from the body, do not try to remove it without a veterinarian accessing it first. Some cancers like melanoma can appear as a black skin tag and may also be easy to confuse.
"
"Cysts of the skin are usually more attached and larger than skin tags. Cysts can be firm or soft, depending on what is inside. Some cysts can have a small attachment like a skin tag but will usually get larger over time. Warts are slightly raised, completely attached to the skin, and usually not moveable.
"
"Be sure to monitor skin tags for any changes, and if you notice the growth changing, becoming larger, or you see many of them on your dog’s body, visit your veterinarian immediately in case a biopsy is needed.
"
"Skin tags are usually caused by chronic irritation. This is why they are seen most often in pressure areas such as the chest, knees, and elbows.  Skin tags can also occur if a collar or harness rubs the skin repeatedly over time. Skin conditions caused by a flea allergy, food allergy, or environmental allergy can cause biting and scratching in one area, leading to a possible skin tag.
"
"A papilloma virus can cause skin tag lesions. Papillomas usually cause warts, but on occasion they can cause skin tags in clusters. The papilloma virus is typically of no concern, and it is cured by removal of the skin tag or wart. If there are multiple skin tags that are bothersome to the dog, antiviral medications can be used.
"
"Boxers, hound breeds, bully-type terriers, English Bulldogs, and Pugs are common breeds with skin tags. However, any breed can develop a skin tag.
"
"Examination of the lesion by a veterinarian can usually provide a diagnosis. However, if the veterinarian is uncertain of the cause, a biopsy is needed. Biopsies are the only definite way to diagnose a skin tag.
"
"In a biopsy, cells are removed from the lesion and sent to a laboratory for further diagnosis.
"
"Your veterinarian will thoroughly examine the scrotal region and should be able to immediately ascertain whether they are of normal size or are smaller than what they should be for your dog's breed, size and age. A finding of abnormal size is enough to urge your veterinarian to conduct further tests in order to differentiate testicular degeneration from hypoplasia. An ultrasound image of the testes is usually done to confirm the visual diagnosis of smaller than normal testes.
"
"Your veterinarian will also take a semen sample for laboratory testing, to check for abnormal cell development and to do a standard sperm count. The sperm count will evaluate the number of viable sperm cells in your dog's semen. If it appears to be called for, under the circumstances, a small tissue sample may also be taken from the testicular sac, using a fine needle, to be sent to the laboratory for further evaluation.
"
"
"
"Treatment depends on diagnosis of the underlying cause of degeneration or hypoplasia. Hormonal therapy has been used in animals with these conditions with variable results reported. Your veterinarian will discuss the possibilities of your dog's future fertility using the various treatment protocols that are available, depending on the final diagnosis. Treatment is not available in all cases, but this cannot always be determined without the appropriate tests being conducted first.
"
"If your doctor does determine that treatment is a viable option, follow-up visits will include serial semen analyses to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy.
"
"There is no special at home care that is recommended for dogs with testicular hypoplasia or degeneration. You may need to take your dog for subsequent laboratory testing during the period of treatment, but this will be entirely dependent on the diagnosis your veterinarian has settled on and the treatment protocol that has been outlined for him.
"
"Dogs with hypoplasia have a poor chance of ever becoming fertile; the chances are a bit better for dogs with degeneration of the testes, but in general, the prognosis for successful breeding remains poor. In any case, the prognosis depends on the underlying cause and successful response to treatment.

"
"A pathologist at the lab will look for certain cells under the microscope to give a definitive diagnosis. Due to the small size of the lesion, removal may be needed to have enough of a sample to submit to the lab.
"
"No treatment is required if your dog is not bothered by skin tags. If they are the result of a virus, antiviral drugs can be prescribed to treat the lesions.
"
"Surgical removal is the only cure for skin tags. Removal can be performed while under generalized or local anesthesia (where medicine is injected under the skin to decrease feeling in the area before cutting). Using a local anesthetic depends upon the location and size of skin tag, as well as the temperament of the dog. 
"
"Usually, skin tags are removed during another procedure such as a dental cleaning, spay, or neuter.  Rarely does skin tag removal qualify for general anesthesia by itself unless a biopsy is needed for diagnosis. Surgical removal can be performed by excision or cauterization. Excision is cutting the attachment of the skin tag, and cauterization uses heat or electricity to burn the tissue attachment.  A recovery cone or collar is recommended to prevent chewing of the area while it is healing.
"
"Skin tags cannot be completely prevented, but some changes can help decrease the likelihood of developing them.
"
"Prevention and management of skin tags requires much of the same care:
"
"Soft, supportive bedding to decrease irritation when lying or getting up and down 
"
"Collars or harnesses can cause irritation; ensure they fit appropriately.
"
"Treatment of allergies that are causing irritation to the area
"
"Keep skin folds clean. MalAcetic and Mal-a-Ket wipes are examples of products that can be used to clean these areas easily.
"
"Trauma can occur to skin tags at the groomer or during play. If that happens, treat it as a wound and seek appropriate medical care. Ensure that your groomer is aware of the skin tags so they are not accidentally cut. 
"
"Monitoring is always recommended, and it is helpful to use a journal to note the description and size of the skin tag each month. Inform your veterinarian of any changes on your next visit, or sooner if you see a cause for concern.

"Metaldehyde -- an ingredient of slug and snail baits, and sometimes solid fuel for camp stoves --  is poisonous in dogs, primarily affecting their nervous system. This type of poisoning is often seen in coastal and low-lying areas, where use of slug and snail bait is customary. And even though metaldehyde poisoning can be seen in both dogs and cats, it is more common in dogs.
"
"Metaldehyde ingestion.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. The questions may specifically pertain to exposure to slug and snail baits or other sources of metaldehyde. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which may be varied. A definitive diagnosis is typically made by verifying the presence of metaldehyde in bodily fluids (e.g., vomitus, stomach contents, and urine).
"
"
"
"A dog suffering from metaldehyde poisoning is the type of emergency which will need immediate hospitalization and treatment. Unfortunately, there is no antidote available. The only course of treatment is to eliminate the metaldehyde from the dog's body. Your veterinarian will pump the dog's stomach and, if it is not convulsing, give activated charcoal to absorb the poison in the stomach and intestines. The dog will be restrained to prevent injury. Fluids are also often necessary to rehydrate the dog.
"
"It is important to not feed a dog that is convulsing or vomiting. Overall prognosis ultimately depends on the amount of metaldehyde ingested, time to treatment, and quality of care provided. If left untreated, however, a dog may die within few hours of ingestion. Watch your dog for vomiting and other symptoms, and call your veterinarian immediately.

"Cutaneous (dicoid) lupus erythematosus is one of the most common immune-mediated skin diseases in dogs. Like other immune-mediated diseases, it is brought on by the abnormal activity of the immune system, whereby it attacks its own body.
"
"Cutaneous lupus erythematosus affects dogs of all ages, with a predisposition in the following breeds: Collies, German shepherds, Siberian huskies, Shetland sheepdogs, Alaskan malamutes, chow chows, and their crosses. It is considered a benign variant of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), which is also an immune mediated disease.
"
"Symptoms of cutaneous lupus erythematosus depend on where the immune system is attacking the body, and may appear or disappear and vary in intensity. The following are a few of the more common symptoms seen in dogs:
"
"Lesions associated with this disease may also involve the outer ear area and more rarely, the feet and genitalia.
"
"Although the disease is brought on by abnormal activity of the immune system, the exact cause of the overactivity is unknown. Factors that are suspected to bring on the disease include drug reactions, viruses, and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal. A small tissue sample may also be taken from the affected area for further evaluation.
"
"
"
"This disease is not life-threatening and symptomatic treatment is often sufficient in most animals. Antibiotics, vitamin supplementation, and topical medications are commonly used. Severe lesions, on the other hand, may be disfiguring in nature and may require a more aggressive therapy. In some dogs, drugs to suppress the immune system are also employed to counter the over-reactivity of the immune system.
"
"Follow your veterinarian's guidelines regarding care of skin lesions; these lesions may bleed spontaneously and need proper attention during the treatment period. The dog should be protected from direct sun exposure (i.e., UV light) and may require sunblock.
"
"You may be asked to bring in your dog every 14 days after initiation of treatment to evaluate clinical response. Laboratory testing, meanwhile, is conducted every three to six months to evaluate the disease and the effectiveness of the treatment. This disease is progressive in nature and remission is seen in the majority of patients. However, if immunosuppressive therapy is required on a long-term basis, prognosis is not good.
"
"In addition, because of the genetic nature of the disease, your veterinarian will recommend against breeding a dog with cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

"Cutaneous drug eruptions cover a spectrum of diseases and clinical signs. They can vary markedly in clinical appearance and pathophysiology – the functional change that accompanies the disease. It is likely that many mild drug reactions go unnoticed or unreported; thus, incidence rates for specific drugs are unknown and most of the facts available on drug-specific reactions have been extrapolated from reports in the human literature.
"
"Some types of drug reactions appear to have a familial basis.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog. The exam will include a full dermatologic exam, with skin scrapings for lab culturing in order to rule out or confirm bacterial and fungal infections. A skin biopsy may also be indicated. Your veterinarian will also order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to what is causing the skin reaction and whether the problem needs to be treated on a deeper level or is only an external condition.
"
"
"
"If is is found that the reaction is coming from an external source, you will need to discontinue use of any shampoos or other topical preparations. Also keep in mind cleaning products that you are using, since it is possible that your dog is reacting to floor cleaners, or other cleaning agents. If it is found to be drug based, your veterinarian will find a suitable replacement for the medication. If the diagnosis is Stevens - Johnson syndrome (SJS), or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), both potentially fatal drug based skin reactions, your dog will need to be treated on an inpatient basis. Intensive supportive care and fluid/nutritional support will be administered, and relief for the pain that is associated with these conditions can be given.
"
"For chronic and persistent idiopathic erythema multiforme (EM), a skin disease of unknown cause, azathioprine is often effective. Human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used successfully for severe EM and TEN when not spontaneously resolving, but it is often cost-prohibitive.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you for your dog, depending on the cause of and severity of your dog’s skin disease. If your dog’s skin condition relapses or worsens, you will need to contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.

"Skin ulcers in dogs are deep sores or open wounds on the skin that often heal poorly on their own. They can be caused by anything that lowers blood supply to an area of the skin.
"
"Skin ulcers can be grouped as either more erosive or ulcerative.
"
"Erosions are shallow wounds on the skin, and ulcers are deeper wounds on the skin that are typically slower to heal.
"
"Usually when ulcers occur, there is a problem with blood flow to that area or a source of chronic irritation to the ulcerated (broken) skin that stops it from healing.
"
"Ulcers are often painful to the touch and may leak fluid or blood. It’s common for ulcers that were not originally caused by a skin infection to become infected.
"
"Because there are so many different skin conditions that can lead to ulceration of the skin, it’s a common condition.
"
"If your dog is eating and drinking OK and has normal energy, you can likely schedule your dog to be seen by their regular veterinarian.
"
"However, don’t wait too long, as ulcers can quickly worsen and noninfected skin ulcers can become infected quickly.
"
"It may be OK to wait through the weekend and call to schedule with their normal vet during business hours. They may ask you to send pictures and will want to know whether your dog is scratching or licking the skin.
"
"If your dog is licking or chewing, a comfy collar is recommended until they can be seen by a veterinarian.
"
"Symptoms of skin ulcers in dogs include:
"
"Hair loss
"
"Inflammation (swelling) of the skin
"
"Affected area is painful to the touch
"
"Odor
"
"Area may be itchy
"
"Affected area may be found over pressure points (such as joints)
"
"Affected area may have dried crusts on the top or be weeping (leaking fluid)
"
"Ulcers on the skin can be caused by many different things. Any condition that changes blood flow to the skin can result in ulcers forming.
"
"Here are a few conditions that are linked to skin ulcers in dogs:
"
"Hereditary disorders: Rarely, a dog can be born with congenital skin issues that show as ulcerations. Familial dermatomyositis is an example of an inherited skin condition that shows up in young puppies, usually younger than six months.
"
"It is more prevalent in Collie and Shetland Sheepdog breeds. Zinc-responsive dermatosis is another hereditary condition that may cause skin ulcers. The Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute breeds are more likely to be affected by this skin disease, which leads to ulcerated skin on the face.
"
"Self-trauma/pyotraumatic dermatitis: Allergies are very common in dogs and can lead to extreme itchiness of the skin and self-trauma, which can show up as hot spots or ulceration of the skin from a dog licking or chewing themselves.
"
"These spots are often infected by the bacteria from the skin and mouth of the dog. This is known as acute moist dermatitis, pyotraumatic dermatitis, or a hot spot, and is a very common cause of skin ulceration. Chronic pain, like joint or nerve pain, can also lead to intense licking of an area of the skin and cause ulcers.
"
"Other trauma: Burns and pressure sores can lead to ulceration. Burns can occur with exposure to intense heat (like fireworks, a house fire, or the oven), electricity, extreme cold (frostbite), or chemicals.
"
"Snake and spider bites can also lead to necrosis (tissue death) and ulceration of the skin. Chronic pressure over thin regions of skin is a common source of microtrauma that leads to skin ulcers in senior dogs that like to lie on hard floors.
"
"Skin infections: There are lots of different things that can cause skin infections. Bacteria, yeast, fungi, and protozoa infections can all lead to skin ulcers. Staphylococcus bacterial pyoderma, candidiasis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, neosporosis, and cutaneous leishmaniasis are all examples of skin infections that can lead to ulcers of the skin.
"
"Dogs can be exposed to these organisms by other dogs, the environment, and even their pet parents.
"
"Vasculitis: Sometimes infectious diseases can disturb blood flow to the skin, like in the tick-borne illness Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. This can lead to skin rashes and ulceration from poor blood supply. Cutaneous vasculitis is another condition where blood flow is changed by an infection, food, vaccine reaction, or inherited condition.
"
"In dogs with vasculitis, the blood vessels become swollen, which can lead to ulcers forming on the skin, especially the ear margins.
"
"External parasites: Flies and mange mites can lead to ulceration of the skin. Fly bite dermatitis results from repeated trauma to the skin in outdoor dogs that are overwhelmed with flies biting their ear flaps, face, and paws.
"
"Immune-mediated disease: Immune-mediated diseases are the result of the body attacking itself. It is poorly understood why some dogs develop immune-mediated diseases while others do not, but vets believe these diseases are largely genetic with a combination of environmental factors that may trigger the immune system.
"
"Pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile cellulitis (puppy strangles), and vesicular cutaneous lupus are all examples of immune-mediated diseases that can lead to skin ulceration.
"
"Drug reactions: Rarely, a dog will have a reaction to a medication that can trigger an immune-mediated response. This is the case with erythema multiforme, also known as toxic epidermal necrolysis. In this condition, the body has an unusual reaction to a medication that can result in severe ulceration of the skin.
"
"While this is very uncommon, several drugs have been implicated, including various beta lactam antibiotics (like penicillin and cephalexin), chloramphenicol, trimethoprim sulfas, levamisole, griseofulvin, and topical flea dips.
"
"Skin cancer: Certain cancers can lead to ulceration of the skin. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer more common on light-colored dogs with lots of exposure to sunlight. It can cause oozing ulcers to develop on affected skin.
"
"Cutaneous lymphoma can also lead to widespread skin ulcers. Mast cell tumors, sarcomas, and mammary tumors are other types of cancer that can lead to ulceration of the skin over the mass itself.
"
"If your dog has skin ulcers, your veterinarian will start by getting a complete history and doing a full physical exam.
"
"They will likely ask you the following questions:
"
"Is your dog itchy? Are you seeing them lick, scratch, or chew on themselves?
"
"How is your dog’s appetite and energy level?
"
"Have they had any exposure to any new medications, food, travel, or other animals?
"
"Is there any history of trauma or injury? Do they spend any time outdoors unsupervised?
"
"Are they on regular parasite prevention?
"
"They may decide to do impression smears of the ulcers using slides to look under the microscope for bacteria.
"
"Your vet may recommend a skin culture, where a swab is sent to an outside laboratory to screen for various fungal or bacterial agents.
"
"Your pup’s urine and blood may be collected for additional testing.
"
"Skin biopsies (removal of some tissue) are often recommended to figure out which of the many underlying causes are more likely.
"
"Treatment of skin ulcers depends on the underlying cause.
"
"If the skin ulcers are caused by a bacteria or have become infected, antibiotics may be prescribed.
"
"If your dog is itchy, Apoquel® or Cytopoint® may be recommended as well to keep them from irritating the affected area while it heals.
"
"If an autoimmune disease is present, steroids or other immunosuppressive medications are often prescribed. Pain management may be needed if your dog’s skin causes severe discomfort.
"
"If your dog is prescribed a new medication, be sure to follow all directions given by your vet.
"
"Pay close attention to any side effects and watch the wounds to see if they are getting better, worse, or remain the same. Start a picture journal, taking a photo of the ulcerated skin every few days to track your dog’s healing.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend topical skin products that have antimicrobials or antifungals, like Douxo S3.
"
"Silver sulfadiazine cream is often recommended for burns, and wound care creams like Silver Honey® can help promote healing in many patients.
"
"Avoid using over-the-counter products on your dog’s ulcers without talking to your veterinarian first. Many of these products can have ingredients that burn or delay healing of ulcerated skin.
"
"While your dog’s skin is healing, be sure they are unable to reach the ulcers. A cone may be necessary if they are licking or chewing the lesions.
"
"Keep the ulcerated skin clean and dry.
"
"One of the most important parts of recovery for skin ulcers is preventing your dog from further irritating the wound(s) while the healing process is happening.
"
"While it’s true that in the wild, wolves will lick their wounds, their wounds are often packed with mud or dirt and they do not have any other options to clean them.
"
"Your dog has better options. There’s no benefit from a dog licking its wounds. In fact, a dog’s saliva has bacteria that can slow the healing process.
"
"It’s better for your dog if you clean their wounds with an antiseptic and keep them clean and dry.
"
"Talk to your veterinarian about which topical cleansing agents they recommend, as they may want you to use a diluted chlorhexidine solution or saline only.
"
"If they approve, consider using a spray product like Vetericyn® Antimicrobial Wound Care Spray, Silver Honey® Spray Gel, or a medicated Douxo S3 Pyo® wipe daily to keep the ulcerated skin clean.
"
"Recovery times vary depending on the severity of your pup’s ulcers, how much skin is affected, and what the underlying cause is.
"
"Most superficial skin ulcers will heal in 10 to 14 days with proper treatment. Deeper ulcers may take several weeks to heal.
"
"Some patients are helped by other wound therapy options. Some veterinarians may offer cold laser therapy, light therapy, or cold hydrotherapy to promote blood supply and healing to the affected area. Talk to your veterinarian about what is best for your dog’s skin ulcers.
"
"Early diagnosis and management of the underlying causes of skin ulcers is the best way to prevent them.
"
"For early detection, practice good skin and coat hygiene with your pet. Ideally, brush your dog daily and look over their body to be sure you don’t see any abnormalities.
"
"For routine maintenance, bathe your dog monthly and make sure they are not getting any feces or urine stuck in the hair around their genitals.
"
"Use regular parasite prevention and avoid letting your dog roam in unsafe areas.
"
"If you notice any changes to your dog’s skin or notice any licking or chewing occurring, contact your veterinarian to get them in for a checkup soon.
"
"Skin ulcers are usually painful to the touch for dogs.
"
"Do not try to drain your dog’s skin ulcer or lesion at home. 
"
"If a wound needs drainage, it should only be done under the supervision of a veterinarian.
"
"It’s easy for pet parents to accidentally add bacteria into wounds that are not infected or worsen lesions that are already infected.
"
"A skin ulcer looks like a red, crater-like depression in the skin that is often wet and oozing. A dog can have one ulcer or many on their skin.

"Skin infections are conditions that are caused by infectious organisms such as bacteria, fungi, or parasites. All areas of skin can be affected, including inside the ears and nose, as well as the hair and nails.
"
"The severity of the disease depends on the type of infection and can vary from very mild to painful and itchy. Some organisms that cause skin infections are transmissible (or contagious), which means the infection can be passed to another mammal through direct contact or the environment. There are also infections that are caused by organisms that normally live on the skin and are not considered contagious.

"
"Redness
"
"Bumps or raised areas of the skin
"
"Itchiness (you may see your dog scratching, licking, and/or chewing the skin)
"
"Scales or flakes
"
"Crusts or scabs
"
"Hair loss (alopecia)
"
"Oozing or discharge (blood, pus, clear)
"
"Skin color changes (darker or lighter)
"
"There are many causes of skin infections in dogs. Some infections are primary infections­—an infection directly caused by an infectious organism. Other infections are secondary infections and occur because of an underlying disease process that triggers an infection.
"
"Scabies is an example of a primary parasitic skin infection. Dogs acquire scabies by direct contact with an infected animal. The scabies mite then causes the clinical signs associated with the disease. Ringworm is an example of a primary fungal infection and is acquired due to contact with infected individuals or an infected environment, including soil.
"
"A common example of a secondary skin infection is one due to skin allergies. The allergies cause inflammation of the skin, which then provides an environment favorable to organism growth. Bacteria or fungi that normally live on the skin are then able to multiply, leading to a bacterial or fungal skin infection.
"
"There are several basic skin tests that are useful in diagnosing a majority of skin infections. The most common ones are:
"
"Skin scrapes: A dull scalpel blade is used to scrape the top layer of the skin; effective for finding skin parasites like demodex.
"
"Skin cytology: A sample is collected by pressing a microscope slide directly to the skin lesion or via a needle and syringe and then looked at under the microscope for bacteria, fungi, or abnormal skin cells.
"
"Tape preps: Clear tape is used to collect a sample of hair or skin to find bacteria, fungi, or parasites when viewed under the microscope.
"
"Cotton swabs: A cotton swab is used to collect a sample, most often from inside the ear, to diagnose bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections.
"
"Cultures: A sample of skin, hair, or discharge is collected onto a growth plate to look for bacterial or fungal growth over time. This test can also be used to learn which antimicrobial medication is best to treat the infection.
"
"The treatment of a skin infection depends on the type of infection, the location of the infection, and the condition of the dog. Bacterial skin infections are treated with oral (by mouth) antibiotics, and/or topical products such as medicated shampoos, conditioners, sprays, and ointments. Common products include:
"
"Epi-Soothe® Shampoo
"
"Malaseb® Shampoo
"
"Zymox® Shampoo
"
"GentaVed® Topical Spray
"
"TrizCHLOR™ Wipes
"
"Animax® Ointment (Rx needed from vet)
"
"Fungal infections are treated similarly, with antifungal medications, and parasites are treated with antiparasitic medications.
"
"To help the skin heal and to prevent future infections, other treatments are used to support healthy skin. For example, when treating an ear infection, special ear cleaners are used in addition to the antimicrobial medication. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation is another treatment used to help resolve and prevent infections. Prevention is often the best medicine and regular bathing and grooming can be helpful for not only treating skin infections but also preventing them from occurring in the first place.
"
"For secondary skin infections, it is important to treat the primary cause of the secondary infection. Skin allergies, for example, frequently require medications to reduce inflammation and allergic reactions. Treating a skin infection without treating the allergy will likely lead to another infection. Food allergies require special diets to reduce skin inflammation. If a food allergy is suspected, your vet will work with you to determine an appropriate food trial, to slowly remove certain ingredients and introduce possible allergies to determine the culprit.
"
"The time it takes to treat a skin infection depends on the type of infection, the ability to treat primary causes of the infection, and the severity of disease. Sometimes the most difficult part of the treatment is sticking with treatments for as long as needed.
"
"Some skin infections can be difficult to treat because of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance occurs over time, when microbes develop defenses against our medications, making those medications ineffective. In those cases, treatment can take longer and may require further testing.
"
"Infections can resurface, especially if the primary cause of the infection has not been treated or resolved. Dogs with chronic conditions such as allergies or other diseases are more likely to have repeat infections. 
"
"Managing skin infections successfully can be complicated, time consuming, and expensive. Following your veterinarian’s recommendations closely and being patient during the treatment period is important for resolving the infection and preventing recurrence in your pup.

"Skin dermatoses is a general medical term that applies to several types of bacterial infections or genetic diseases of the skin. Some dermatoses are cosmetic conditions involving loss of pigmentation of the skin and/or hair coat, but are otherwise no harmful.
"
"For instance, German Shepherds tend to bacterial skin infections involving areas of the lips, eyelids, and nostrils. German Shepherds, Collies, and Shetland sheepdogs are predisposed to lupus, an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks its own skin and other organs, and discoid lupus, an autoimmune disease involving the skin only, usually the face.
"
"Chow chows and Akitas are predisposed to an autoimmune disease involving the skin, characterized by inflammation with crusting, and lesions containing pus.
"
"Akitas, Samoyeds and Siberian huskies tend to develop a rare syndrome that causes inflammation in the front part of the eye. The most affected area is the iris, with coexistent inflammation of the skin characterized by loss of pigment in the skin of the nose and lips.
"
"Doberman Pinschers and Rottweilers may develop a condition characterized by symmetrical lack of pigment in the skin and a white hair coat, especially involving the face and nose. Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and Labrador Retrievers can display a seasonal loss of pigment in the tough, hairless skin of the nose. St. Bernards and Giant schnauzers can be afflicted with inflammation of the arteries of the nasal philtrum, the juncture between the sides of the upper lip extending to the nose.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition, such as whether your dog suffered a recent infection. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. Blood samples can be tested for autoimmune factors.
"
"As part of your dog's physical exam, your veterinarian will take skin samples and skin scrapings to send to a lab for bacterial and fungal cultures. If the skin biopsy shows that skin cells are separating from each other (acantholytic), this is diagnostic for pemphigus. Direct immunofluorescence of skin samples using fluorescent dyes can also be used to demonstrate antibodies. Your veterinarian may also take fluid samples from your dog's joints to check for lupus.
"
"
"
"Unless your dog is suffering from multiple organ dysfunction caused by lupus, treatment may be performed on an outpatient basis. Antibiotics will be prescribed by your veterinarian if a bacterial or fungal infection is present. Immunosuppressive medication is often prescribed for autoimmune disorders. Your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist if your dog's eyes are affected. Unless topical medications or ointments have been specifically prescribed by your veterinarian for your pet, any preparation should be avoided.
"
"You will need to protect your dog from exposure to the sun if it has been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus erythematosus, or pemphigus erythematosus. You can easily apply a water resistant sunblock with an SPF of greater than 30 to depigmented areas of your dog's skin for walks or days out n the sun. If your dog is exposed to plastic or rubber dishes (especially if the dishes have roughened edges which might cause abrasions), they will need to be replaced.
"
"If your dog's skin condition worsens, you will need to contact your veterinarian, since it may indicate something more serious that is underlying the skin condition, such as a spreading infection. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary to monitor your dog's skin ailment. Animals that are taking immunosuppressive medications (for autoimmune diseases) should have frequent blood work tests performed.

"Sterile nodular/granulomatous dermatoses are diseases in which the primary lesions are nodules, or masses of tissue that are solid, elevated, and greater than one centimeter in diameter.
"
"The nodules are usually the result of an infiltration of inflammatory cells into the skin.  This may be a reaction to interal or external stimuli. 
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.
"
"The physical exam should include a dermatologic exam, during which skin biopsies for histopathology can be taken to determine if structural changes have occurred in the tissue.  Skin scrapings will also be examined microscopically and cultured for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi.
"
"
"
"Most of these skin disorders can be treated on an outpatient basis, unless they have reached a severe stage. A few of these disorders, such as malignant histiocytosis, amyloidosis, and nodular dermatofibrosis, are almost always fatal.  Dogs with calcinosis cutis may need to be hospitalized for sepsis and intense topical therapy.
"
"Some of the other forms of dermatoses with nodules or granulomas are discussed below:
"
"Your veterinarian will prescribe medication dependent upon your dog's diagnosis and condition. If your dog is taking long-term glucocorticoids, bloodwork and a urinalysis will need to be performed every six months. If your dog is taking dimethylsulfoxide for calcinosis cutis, bloodwork should be performed every 1-2 weeks to monitor calcium levels until they are regulated.

"Dermatophilosis is a skin disease that is irrespective of the age or gender of the animal, although the symptoms may vary. It is most often contracted from farm animals such as cows, sheep, or horses, and is prevelant in warm or humid climates. Dogs with wet skin or skin that is wounded from parasitic bites, such as from fleas or ticks, increases the chances of contracting the skin disease.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"You will see gray-yellow crusted bumps, like hives, on the skin of the body or head. The dog will try to scratch them. The bumps may be circular in form. When the bumps are removed you will see that they have dozens of hairs in them, due to the hair follicle being impacted. The areas are likely to have pus beneath the hive.
"
"Your veterinarian will take samples of the pus and crusted skin to analyze them for dermatophilosis bacteria. These bacteria are easy to recognize on sight because of their described “railroad track” appearance (also described as paint brush lines). If there is pus under the crusts, it will also be examined. Once tests determine that the dermatophilosis bacteria are present, treatment will be prescribed.
"
"Be sure to tell your veterinarian if your dog has been near farm animals or has been in an environment where there are farm animals. This information will help in determining whether the infection is dermatophilosis. A biopsy of the ulcers, and samples of the pus, will be taken where an ulcer is draining. Once tests determine that the dermatophilosis bacteria are present, treatment will be prescribed. If dermatophilosis is ruled out, further tests will be ordered to determine exactly what is causing this skin disorder.
"
"
"
"Antibacterial shampoo will be used, followed by the gentle removal of infected flesh or abscesses. One or two baths will usually be enough. Consult your veterinarian as to which shampoo you should use. Following the cleaning, your veterinarian may also prescribe antibiotics to be taken for 10 to 20 days, especially if the infection has become severe. The antibiotic most commonly used is penicillin, however, the following are also used at times: tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin.
"
"Your veterinarian will then want to see your dog again after two to three weeks, to make certain the condition has cleared. If the results are negative, another seven days of therapy may be prescribed.
"
"It is possible, though unlikely, that humans in contact with the dog can become infected. If the animal caregivers, or other members of the household, have compromised immune systems, it is advised that the dog be kept isolated from such persons until the condition has cleared.

"A mucocutaneous plasmacytoma is a rapidly developing skin tumor of plasma cells origin. A form of white blood cell, plasma cells produce antibodies, which help the immune system identify and neutralize foreign organisms. Often, mucocutaneous plasmacytomas are found on the dog's trunk and legs. They are also most common in mixed-breed dogs and cocker spaniels.
"
"In addition to being found on the trunk and legs, mucocutaneous plasmacytomas may develop on the mouth, feet, and ears (lip tumors are particularly small and often overlooked). These tumors are generally solitary, solid nodules, either raised or ulcerated.
"
"The underlying cause for the development of these tumors has yet to be identified.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which should be normal, unless some concurrent disease is also present. The most popular diagnostic procedure is to aspirate a nodule and send it to a veterinary pathologist for further testing. If abnormal tumor cells are identified, your dog may be suffering from mucocutaneous plasmacytoma(s).
"
"
"
"If the tumor has become invasive, surgery is typically recommended to excise the tumor and surrounding tissue. Radiotherapy is also conducted in some dogs in order to destroy the neoplastic tissue.
"
"Fortunately, most dogs respond well to surgery and radiotherapy, and overall prognosis is excellent with treatment.

"Skin cancer is an abnormal growth of skin cells. While the term cancer has come to be used as a synonym of malignancy, fortunately not all skin cancer is malignant or cancerous. Tumors that are not malignant are called benign.
"
"Malignant tumors are those that spread to other parts of the body through the blood stream or lymphatic system. Benign masses are those that do not have any harmful effects beyond the tumor itself.
"
"As it does with humans, sun exposure (UV radiation) can increase the risk of skin cancer in many species. Dogs with lighter colored fur and skin are at higher risk of developing certain types of skin tumors.
"
"Beyond the sun exposure risk, further study is needed to figure out what causes skin tumors to form. There is a genetic link with some types of tumors, like the high prevalence of mast-cell tumors in Boxers, Bulldogs, Boston Terriers and Pugs. There are even growths that can be caused by viral infections.
"
"If you come across a lump on your pet, don’t immediately panic. There are many possible causes for lumps, and thankfully many are benign or easily treatable. The most important thing for you to do is to be diligent about watching your pup for any lumps or bumps, and let your vet know about any that you find.
"
"Lipomas: This is a tumor that generally lies just under the surface of the skin. These masses originate from fat/lipid cells. Lipomas tend to be soft and squishy (fluctuant) and are generally not attached to any underlying structures. Lipomas can be quite small (grape sized) but can grow to be the size of a watermelon.
"
"Histiocytomas: These tumors are generally found on the limbs of younger dogs, generally those less than 2 years old. They originate from a cell type called a Langerhans cell, which is part of the immune system. These tumors are often called “button tumors” as they tend to be small, round, raised, hairless pink masses. These tumors are fairly common in larger-breed dogs like Labrador Retrievers, American Staffordshire Terriers and Boxers. A true histiocytoma usually goes away (regresses) on its own after about three months.
"
"Bullous pemphigoid is an uncommon skin condition that affects dogs, and is characterized by the appearance of fluid or pus filled blisters, and severe open sores on the skin and/or mucus-lined tissue of the mouth. Bullous pemphigoid requires initial aggressive treatment, and may be fatal if left untreated.
"
"Some breeds, such as collies, Shetland sheepdogs, and Doberman pinschers are believed to be at the highest risk.
"
"Bullous pemphigoid is found in two forms: the common blister (bullous) form and the relatively rare long-term (chronic) form. The bullous form is characterized by open sores, short-term blisters, and circular lesions on the top layer of skin. Called epidermal collarettes, they are characterized by peeling edges, are circular in shape, and have a rim. The onset is often sudden and severe, and distribution of these symptoms is widespread across the head, neck, abdomen, groin, feet, and mucous membrane (the moist tissues lining the nose and mouth). Dogs that are severely affected may also exhibit lack of appetite (anorexia) and depression.
"
"Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease. It occurs when the body creates an antibody that attacks the cells of the body. The body is, in effect, attacking itself. Referred to as an autoantibody, this specific type is known as the pemphigoid antibody. It is directed at the skin under the surface (membrane) or at the inner mucus linings of the body, and causes a blister formation below the skin. Sunlight may worsen the condition.
"
"A variety of tests may be used to diagnose bullous pemphigoid. An examination (biopsy) of the lesions, of the tissue and fluid in the blisters, is the first step. Urine tests, and bacterial cultures may be taken to check for secondary infections caused by the entrance of bacteria. Other tests that your veterinarian decides to do are dependent on additional symptoms that may suggest alternate diagnoses. For example, other possible diagnoses may include fungal infection, or exposure to toxic substances.
"
"
"
"Treatment varies depending on severity of symptoms and the possibility of secondary infection, due to bacterial infection for example. Bullous pemphigoid condition requires immunosuppressive agents, which slow or halt the immune system’s activity, and gentle cleansing soaks with antibacterial shampoo and water. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat bacterial infections that develop as a secondary result of this skin condition. Continued hospital treatment is only necessary if serious symptoms remain throughout the body (systematic) or secondary infections occur. Even with prompt and effective treatment, the long term prognosis for this disease is not good.
"
"Dogs with bullous pemphigoid should be monitored frequently to observe the progression of the disease or for medication related side effects, such as a weakened immune system (a condition known as immunosuppression). Keep patients out of sun, as ultraviolet (UV) light may worsen lesions.
"
"Since UV rays may worsen the condition, avoiding excessive sun would be best for your dog until treatment has finished.

"Papilloma: These are wart-like growths that commonly occur around the mouth or eyes of younger dogs or dogs with immature or weaker immune systems. They are caused by the canine papilloma virus or CPV1. The virus is transmitted through the pet's environment, usually by food or water bowls. It takes about 1 to 2 months for the tumors to appear, and they generally go away in that same period of time.
"
"Sebaceous Adenomas: These are tumors that begin in oil glands in the skin. These masses tend to look like a raised, hairless bumpy mass and are generally smaller — usually the size of a pea or blueberry. They do tend to be more prevalent in older, light colored dogs and particularly small dogs (especially Poodles, Shih Tzus, and Maltese).
"
"Mast Cell Tumor: A mast cell is part of your immune system and is also involved in allergic reactions. As part of an allergic response, mast cells release histamine, a common mediator of allergies. However, mast cell tumors (MCT) can release large amounts of histamine at once, a phenomenon called mass degranulation. This causes swelling, itchiness, irritation and even life-threatening allergic reactions. These masses can vary in appearance but are typically a raised red lump that may be ulcerated (having an open sore) and display swelling of the surrounding tissue. Mast cell tumors are the most common skin tumor in dogs, and the average age of occurrence is around 10 years old.
"
"Mast cell tumors are most common in Boxers, Boston Terriers, Bulldogs, Pugs, Staffordshire Terriers, Labradors, Golden Retrievers, Rhodesian Ridgebacks and Weimaraners.
"
"Squamous Cell Carcinomas: This is a type of tumor that originates directly from the epidermis or skin cells. These tumors tend to form in older animals, especially those with lighter skin and/or shorter fur. It is also common on the nose of pets that spend a large amount of time outside. The appearance of a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can vary widely. It is also the second most common oral tumor in dogs and can occur on the gums or tongue. When on the skin, these masses tend to first appear as red or ulcerated skin. Crusting and erosion can also occur.
"
"Melanomas: This type of skin tumor arises from melanocytes, which are the cells that give our skin color with the pigment melanin. These tumors are generally pigmented (colored), mostly black or brown and are found in a region of the dog’s body that has less hair, especially around the mouth, feet and eyes. Melanomas of the toes (or digits) is prevalent in black dogs and may start as a swelling around a toenail. Melanomas are also the most common oral tumor in dogs. These tumors unfortunately grow quickly and have a high tendency to spread.
"
"Fibrosarcoma: This type of tumor develops from the connective tissues of the skin and beneath the skin. These are most found on the legs of middle-aged or older dogs. They usually appear as a firm lump on the skin or under it. There may be multiples of these small lumps in one place. There may be pain and swelling associated with these masses which can bleed, open and become infected. These tumors can also be found around the mouth and nose.
"
"A change in your pet’s skin is the most common sign of skin cancer in dogs. Fortunately, this means that there is a highly visible change and lumps can be noticed early.  
"
"This change is generally a new growth, lump or bump but it can also potentially appear as a sore that refuses to heal. All new lumps and bumps regardless of size, color, location, consistency or fur should be evaluated by a veterinarian.
"
"Skin cancer is, by definition, a mass that grows without normal cell regulations — from any of the many cell types that make up your dog’s skin.
"
"We do not know all the reasons why a cell begins to replicate without the normal restrictions that the body has in motion to regulate cell growth. As it does with humans, sun exposure (UV radiation) can increase the risk of skin cancer in dogs, especially those with light skin colors.
"
"Beyond the sun exposure risk, further studies are needed to figure out what causes skin tumors to form in dogs. Additional known causes include genetic links, like mast cell tumors and viral infections, like papillomas.
"
"Any lump that visibly grows, irritates a pet, bleeds, changes size or color, is larger than a pea, or has been present for a month or more should be checked by your pet’s primary care veterinarian.
"
"Different diagnostic procedures may be recommended. Many tumors look alike on the outside, so it’s very important for your veterinarian to check all masses and determine a plan of treatment.
"
"A needle biopsy is generally the first step toward a diagnosis, but other testing may be recommended at the same time, or at a future visit. A select group of masses or dogs, like a young dog with a suspected histiocytoma or papilloma, may call for monitoring before further testing is done.
"
"Needle Biopsy
"
"A needle biopsy (also called an FNA or Fine Needle spirate) is a way of collecting a sampling of cells from within a mass for evaluation. A needle is inserted into the mass, and cells are either compressed into the needle as it is inserted or pulled into the needle through a syringe. These collected cells are then placed onto a slide and examined under the microscope.
"
"Most needle biopsies are sent to a laboratory where a veterinarian pathologist evaluates the sample. This sample of cells is a part of the mass, and while this procedure will often give you an exact diagnosis, it is possible that the cells collected will not provide a complete overview of the mass.
"
"Some patients may require sedation for a needle biopsy depending on the location of the mass and the patient's temperament (personality).
"
"Punch/Tissue Biopsy
"
"In some cases, there is the need to evaluate a larger part of the tissue. When this is needed, a section of the mass or the entire mass (if it is about 8 mm or less) can be removed and sent to a lab for evaluation. Patients may need local anesthesia (like Novocain at your dentist's office), sedation or full anesthesia for a biopsy to be done, depending on the patient and the tumor location.
"
"Radiographs/X-rays
"
"With tumors that are suspected to be cancerous/malignant, there is the risk of spread to other portions of the body. The lungs are a very common place for spread (or metastasis) of tumors, so radiographs are often recommended to monitor for signs of malignant cells spreading.
"
"Advanced Imaging
"
"Advanced imaging includes diagnostic testing like CT (computerized tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or ultrasound. These tests are often used to determine the extent of a tumor that is deeper than skin level or they may be used to examine lymph nodes around a mass to see if a malignant tumor has spread to those areas.
"
"Since there are quite a few different types of tumors that can affect the skin, each case should be treated individually based on your pet and the tumor type, stage and location. Many types of skin tumors are treatable, especially if caught early. Generally, treatment will include one or more of the following: surgery, chemotherapy, radiation or immunotherapy.
"
"For most skin tumors, especially tumors that are small and in easily accessible areas of the body, surgical removal is often the first treatment step. This removes most, if not all, cancer cells from the area. Surgery can be curative, meaning that removal of the mass should be the only treatment necessary (like with small benign masses, such as sebaceous adenomas), or it can be part of a large treatment plan (like with melanomas where spread/metastasis is common).
"
"Chemotherapy is a medication that is either given intravenously (IV) or by mouth. These drugs are toxic to cells that divide rapidly, like those involved in tumor growth. Chemotherapy is often used in certain types of cancer present in multiple locations in the body — or after surgical removal of a mass that is already suspected of spreading.
"
"Radiation therapy uses a focus-radiation beam to target specific tumors, generally in areas which make surgical removal difficult. Radiation is often used in combination with surgery or chemotherapy.
"
"Immunotherapy is very much like a vaccine. For a very select number of cancer types (like melanomas), an immunotherapy vaccine is available. This vaccine contains killed parts of a cancerous cell. These cell pieces travel through your pet's system stimulating its own immune system to fight off cancerous cells. Immunotherapy is also generally used in conjunction with one or more of the other treatment types.
"
"Recovery and management of skin cancer is highly dependent on the type of tumor present. Your veterinarian will review any diagnostic findings and discuss your pet's recommended treatment and prognosis. They may choose to refer you to a veterinary oncologist. 
"
"After surgery, your dog may feel sore and your veterinarian will likely prescribe pain medication. Please strictly follow all medication directions. Many patients will need crate rest. Your veterinarian will give you a time frame for return to normal activity levels.
"
"If chemotherapy is part of your pet’s treatment plan, it can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and low energy levels. Your vet may prescribe anti-nausea medications, or other supportive therapies, while your pet is undergoing chemotherapy. It is also important to ensure that your pet is getting high-quality food to aid in a quick recovery.
"
"When possible, limit your pet's exposure to the sun, especially during peak UV hours. Pets with light colors or short fur may benefit from dog sunscreen.
"
"Early intervention is extremely important for many types of skin tumors. It is very important to monitor your pet for the formation of lumps and bumps on their skin and for you to be an active advocate in its care by seeking an evaluation of the mass by your vet promptly.
"
"Any mass, even one that has previously been diagnosed as benign, should be evaluated if a change in size, shape or color is noted — or if there is any bleeding. Many cancerous or malignant masses can often recur in the same area, so it is important to watch your dog closely for any other masses and report them to your vet.
"
"Any mass that appears on or under your pet’s fur should be watched closely. Masses that change size, shape, or texture—or those that bleed—should be evaluated as soon as possible. Additionally, any mass that has been present for more than a month or is larger than a pea should be examined by a veterinarian.
"
"Certain types of malignant skin tumors can be fatal, if untreated.
"
"The prognosis for a dog with skin cancer is highly dependent on the type of tumor, which is why diagnostic testing in the early stages is extremely important. Prognosis for benign tumors is excellent and these generally do not affect life expectancy. Malignant tumors have a wide effect on life expectancy. Some malignant tumors can be safely and easily removed and have no effect on the life span of a dog, however some of the more aggressive tumor types can drastically decrease life expectancy.

"Dermatologic food reactions are non-seasonal reactions which occur following ingestion of one or more allergy causing substances in an animal’s food. The physical reaction is frequently excessive itchiness, with resultant excessive scratching at the skin.
"
"While the pathogenesis of these reactions is not fully understood, immediate reactions and delayed reactions to food are thought to be due to a hypersensitive immune response.  On the other hand, food intolerance is a non-immunologic idiosyncratic reaction due to the metabolic, toxic or pharmacologic effects of the offending ingredients. Since it is not easy to distinguish between immunologic and idiosyncratic reactions, any negative response to food is generally referred to as an adverse food reaction.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a dermatological exam. Non-food causes of dermatologic disease should be ruled out. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other causes of disease. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, especially regarding any changes in diet, and any new foods added to your dog's diet, even if temporary.
"
"Food elimination diets are advised for dogs thought to be suffering from adverse food reactions. These diets typically include one protein source and one carbohydrate source to which the dog has had limited or no previous exposure to. A clinical improvement may be seen as soon as four weeks into the new diet, and maximum alleviation of clinical signs may be seen as late as thirteen weeks into the food elimination diet.
"
"If your dog improves on the elimination diet, a challenge should be performed to confirm that the original diet was the cause of disease and to determine what ingredient in the original diet triggered the adverse reaction.
"
"Challenge: feed your dog with the original diet. A return of the signs confirms that something in the diet is causing the signs. The challenge period should last until the signs return but no longer than ten days.
"
"If the challenge confirms the presence of an adverse food reaction, the next step is to perform a provocation diet trial: going back to the elimination diet, begin by adding a single ingredient to the diet. After waiting a sufficient amount of time for the ingredient to prove either agreeable or adverse, if there is no physical reaction, move on to adding the next ingredient to your dog's diet. The provocation period for each new ingredient should last up to ten days, less if signs develop sooner (dogs usually develop signs within 1–2 days). Should symptoms of an adverse reaction develop, discontinue the last added ingredient and wait for the symptoms to subside before moving forward to the next ingredient.
"
"The test ingredients for the provocation trials should include a full range of meats (beef, chicken, fish, pork, and lamb), a full range of grains (corn, wheat, soybean, and rice), eggs, and dairy products. The results of these trials will guide your selection of commercial foods, based on those that do not contain the offending substance(s).
"
"[video]
"
"
"
"Avoid any food substances that caused the clinical signs to return during the provocation phase of the diagnosis. Antibiotics or antifungal medications may be prescribed by your veterinarian if secondary pyodermas or Malassezia infections are taking place.
"
"Treats, chewable toys, vitamins, and other chewable medications (e.g., heartworm preventive) that may contain ingredients from your dog's previous diet must be eliminated. Make sure to read all ingredient labels carefully. If your dog spends time outdoors you will need to create a confined area to prevent foraging and hunting, which can alter the test diet. All family members will need to be made aware of the test protocol and must help keep the test diet clean and free of any other food sources. Cooperation is essential to successful treatment of this disorder.

"A vesicle, or blister, is a small, defined elevation of the outer layer of the skin (known as the epidermis). It is filled with serum, the clear watery fluid that separates from the blood.  A pustule is also a small, defined elevation of the outer layer of the skin (epidermis), but is filled with pus -- a mixture of serum, white blood cells, cellular debris and dead tissue.
"
"Vesiculo refers to vesicles; this prefixed form is attached to the diseased condition that is concurrent with the cause of the blister. Pustular refers to an organism that is covered in pustules. Dermatoses is the plural form of dermatosis, which is used to describe any abnormality or disorder of the skin.
"
"One or more of the following signs may be present:
"
"Vesicles
"
"Pustules
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis.

"
"Most dogs may be treated on an outpatient basis. However, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pemphigus vulgaris, and bullous pemphigoid may have advanced to the point of severe illness and will require inpatient intensive care.
"
"Ask your veterinarian if your dog might benefit from periodic bathing with an antimicrobial shampoo to help remove surface debris and control secondary bacterial infections.  Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your dog to check bloodwork.  Initially, these follow-up appointments might be as often as every 1-2 weeks.  Later, the visits may be tapered off to once every three to four months depending on how your dog responds to the medication.

"Melanocytic tumors are benign or cancerous growths, arising from melanocytes (pigment-producing skin cells) and melanoblasts (melanin-producing cells that develop or mature into melanocytes). These tumors do not seem to have a genetic basis; however, males, especially Scottish Terriers, Boston Terriers, Airedale Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, Boxers, English Springer Spaniels, Irish Setters, Irish Terriers, Chow Chows, Chihuahuas, Schnauzers, and Doberman Pinschers, seem to have a predilection to the condition. Dogs 10 years or older are also more prone to melanocytic tumors.
"
"In addition, melanocytic tumors can be found in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Melanocytic tumors may develop anywhere on a dog's body, though it is more common on the face, trunk, feet, and scrotum. Depending on the location of the lesion, they may be pigmented or non-pigmented. Additionally, lymph nodes near the affected area may become enlarged.
"
"These masses may develop slowly or rapidly, but in advance stages of the disease, the dog may have trouble breathing or make harsh lung sounds due to the spread of the cancer into the lungs. Furthermore, if the masses have spread to a limb, the dog may appear lame or have difficulty walking.
"
"The cause of melanocytic tumors in dogs is currently unknown.
"
"Cell examination and special stains may distinguish amelanotic melanoma from poorly differentiated mast cell tumors, lymphoma, and carcinoma. Your veterinarian may also X-ray the affected area to determine if the underlying bone has been compromised, especially if the growth is one a toe (or digit).

"Depending on the severity and location of the tumor, your veterinarian may need to surgically remove it. He or she may also recommend chemotherapy if surgical removal is incomplete or if the cancer has spread to other vital organs.
"
"Because early detection of recurrence is crucial, your veterinarian will recommend regular followup exams subsequent to the surgery (every three months for 24 months). However, it is important that you bring the dog back to veterinarian immediately if you suspect the mass has returned.

"Your dog's immune system produces chemicals called antibodies to protect its body against harmful substances and organisms such as viruses, bacteria, etc. An autoimmune disorder is a condition in which the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful antigens and its own healthy body tissues, leading it to destroy the healthy body tissues. Uveodermatologic syndrome is one such autoimmune disorder known to affect dogs.
"
"Some breeds are at an increased risk of developing this disorder, including Akitas, Samoyeds, and Siberian huskies. However, dogs of all ages are at risk.
"
"Underlying autoimmune disorder
"
"After recording a complete history, your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and ophthalmological exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Standard laboratory work will include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The results of these tests are often found normal in animals with this disorder.
"
"Your veterinarian will also take skin tissue samples to be sent to laboratory for evaluation. The veterinary pathologist will examine the tissue sample microscopically to distinguish any changes that are characteristic of this condition.
"
"Sjögren-like syndrome is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease seen in adult dogs. Similar to the eponymous human illness, this syndrome is typically characterized by dry eyes, dry mouth, and glandular inflammation due to the infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells (white blood cells which produce antibodies). It is also associated with other autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and pemphigus.
"
"The underlying cause of Sjögren-like syndrome is currently unknown.  However, autoantibodies which attack the glandular tissues are thought to be a factor. Dog breeds that are more prone to this syndrome include the English bulldog, West Highland white terrier, and miniature schnauzer.  (Cats do not seem to develop this Sjögren-like syndrome.)
"
"Typically, the onset of symptoms associated with Sjögren-like syndrome begin once the dog reaches adulthood. Such symptoms include:
"
"Because it develops concurrently with other immune-mediated and autoimmune diseases, there appears to be an immunologic factor to Sjögren-like syndrome. Some dog breeds may also be genetically predisposed to this disease.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. Your veterinarian may also employ a Schirmer tear test to determine if the tear production is at a normal rate (0 to 5 millimeters per minute).
"
"A few common serological results seen in dogs with Sjögren-like syndrome include:
"
"
"
"Often directed at managing concurrent diseases and controlling controlling keratoconjunctivitis sicca. This entails the use of topical tear preparations, immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory drugs, and topical antibiotics for secondary bacterial infection of the cornea. Dogs that do not respond well the these methods may require surgery.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up appointments to examine the dog's progress and manage concurrent diseases and side effects associated with immunosuppressive drugs.

"Immediate therapy is of utmost importance in order to prevent permanent damage to the eyes. If treatment is not started in time, your dog may develop complications and may even become permanently blind.
"
"The main objective of the treatment is to suppress the abnormal immune response that is taking place against the healthy body tissues, in this case the eyes and skin. Based on the final findings, the appropriate injections and eye drops will be prescribed for your dog.
"
"Because suppressing the immune system can lead to its own complications, you will need to go over the details of this approach with your veterinarian. There are important steps that need to be taken to protect your dog from acquiring serious infections while it is undergoing immune system therapy.
"
"During the initial course of treatment, you may need to visit your veterinarian twice every week. During each visit your veterinarian will conduct laboratory testing and eye examinations to monitor your dog's progress and adjust medications as needed. Drug doses need to be adjusted regularly to prevent some of the complications that are often related to immunosuppressive therapy.
"
"Finally, you will need to monitor your dog's overall health and report anything of concern to your veterinarian so that it can be resolved quickly, before it becomes a possibly life-threatening issue.

"Shaker syndrome is a disorder which causes a dog's entire body to shake. It is also known as idiopathic cerebellitis, which describes inflammation of the cerebellum (the part of the brain that is responsible for the coordination and regulation of voluntary muscular movement) for unknown reasons.
"
"While dogs of any coat color can be affected, those with a white hair coat are over-represented in the medical literature. For example, Maltese and West Highland white terriers appear to be predisposed. In addition, both genders are affected by shaker syndrome, especially young to middle-aged dogs.
"
"Shock is a complex, whole-body reaction to various situations, typically caused by a lack of effective circulation, decreased oxygen, and/or decreased energy usage within cells. If your pet is not treated quickly, shock is usually fatal.
"
"The term “shock” has different meanings, even among specialists. In general, it is characterized by the following types and their causes:
"
"Hypovolemic shock, the most common type, occurs when the circulating blood volume is dangerously low. This happens with internal hemorrhage (ruptured tumors), external hemorrhage (trauma), coagulopathies (impairment of blood clotting ability), low blood protein, or dehydration (vomiting and diarrhea, burns, or decreased drinking).
"
"Cardiogenic shock is a severe form of heart failure, where the heart cannot properly pump blood throughout the body. It occurs due to heart disease, heartworm infection, toxins, drug reactions, or severe arrhythmias.
"
"Distributive shock, also known as vasodilatory shock, occurs when there is an incorrect distribution of blood flow. This type of shock includes the more well-known subtypes: septic (due to infection of the bloodstream, commonly caused by bacterial infection) and anaphylactic (due to allergic response). It is caused by a variety of abnormalities, generally associated with too much blood volume in the peripheral tissues and not enough circulating in the main vessels. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), adverse drug reactions, drug overdose, heatstroke, and embolic disease are other causes of distributive shock.
"
"Hypoxic shock is caused by decreased blood oxygen levels. This may be secondary to lung disease or to the blood’s inability to carry oxygen correctly. Examples of diseases leading to hypoxic shock include methemoglobinemia, carbon monoxide toxicity, severe lung disease, and anemia.
"
"Metabolic shock occurs when the tissues have good blood and oxygen supply but the cells can’t produce enough energy to stay alive. It is caused by abnormal cell metabolism and occurs in some cases of sepsis, low blood sugar, cyanide toxicity, pH abnormalities, and mitochondrial dysfunction.
"
"Because of the complexity of shock, animals will often have multiple types of shock at the same time. For example, a dog in septic shock may also have a degree of hypovolemic shock. In other cases, one type of shock may lead to another as organs fail. 
"
"Shock in any form is a medical emergency. Seek emergency veterinary care immediately if you think your dog is showing signs of shock.
"

"
"Although a dog may be affected by the syndrome due to unknown reasons (idiopathic), it is most often associated with mild central nervous system disease.
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's physical and behavioral health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including standard laboratory work, such as a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases. A cerebrospinal fluid (fluid from the spinal cord) sample may also be taken by your veterinarian and sent to the laboratory for analysis of the nervous system.
"
"Your doctor will use the process of differential diagnosis to rule out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. Some other causes for the tremors can be anxiety/fear, seizures, and hypothermia.
"
"
"
"Depending on how severe the tremors are, and your dog's overall condition, care will be given inpatient or outpatient. If your dog is very ill as the result of tremors, or if there is an underlying condition or infection, your dog will be hospitalized until its health stabilizes. The primary treatment for neurological shaker syndrome is the use of corticosteroids for reducing the inflammatory response in the body. Most dogs recover in a week although some rare patients never entirely recover. The steroids will be gradually reduced over the course of a few months until they are not being used anymore. Steroid treatment will be  reinstated if symptoms recur, and in some cases, steroid treatment will need to be continued for a longer period and possible even the lifetime of the dog in order to maintain health.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule weekly evaluations for your dog for the first month after the initial treatment. Thereafter, your veterinarian will schedule monthly follow-up appointments with you for your pet until the corticosteroids are discontinued.

"
"Dogs in shock may have a history of trauma, surgery, weakness, collapse, vomiting, diarrhea, or decreased water intake.
"
"Signs of shock include:
"
"Pale or discolored gums
"
"Weak pulses
"
"Altered, dull mental state, such as lethargy or confusion
"
"Decreased body temperature
"
"Increased and abnormal heart rate
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Dehydration (presenting as decreased skin elasticity, tacky mucous membranes, sunken eyes)
"
"The signs of shock continuously change and progress quickly. In the early, or compensated, stage of shock, some animals only show mild clinical signs. This early stage can be difficult to recognize, but as time passes, shock can progress to an intermediate stage, known as early decompensated shock.
"
"In the intermediate stage, the body attempts to conserve blood volume and proper cardiac output by giving vital organs priority in blood distribution. Often, this attempt reduces blood to the other organs, causing them to fail. Without intervention and veterinary treatment, dogs will die once they have reached the intermediate stage.
"
"The late stage of shock, also known as late decompensated or irreversible shock, leads to systemic inflammation, systemic organ failure, and death. Survival after this stage of shock is rare.  
"
"Veterinarians may suspect shock based on a physical exam and the dog’s history. All types of shock will require similar testing. The common tests include:
"
"Routine bloodwork, including a complete blood count and biochemistry profile, to look for secondary issues and organ function
"
"Lactic acid tests that indicate how successfully the blood is being distributed to the body
"
"Blood gas and oxygen saturation (SpO2) analyses to assess oxygenation status
"
"Blood pressure evaluation
"
"Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) to monitor arrhythmias
"
"Radiographs to assess for internal hemorrhage, wounds, cancer, heart or lung disease
"
"Coagulation tests to determine a potential cause of shock or the severity of shock
"
"Checking for cardiac enzymes that may indicate heart muscle injury
"
"Echocardiography (heart ultrasound) to assess for cardiac dysfunction, valve disease, contractility, and heartworm
"
"Regardless of the type of shock, the goals for treating dogs in shock are the same: to minimize the pet’s stress as much as possible, to diagnose and treat the underlying disease processes, and to:
"
"Restore blood volume with intravenous fluids* and blood transfusions if needed
"
"Stop any ongoing hemorrhage or damage
"
"Increase tissue oxygenation with supplemental oxygenation
"
"Correct any cardiac arrhythmias with drugs or surgery
"
"Prevent (or treat) any potential infection or suspicion of sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy
"
"Prevent and correct any organ failure
"
"*Intravenous fluids are crucial; however, in cardiogenic shock, this treatment could make the situation worse until the underlying condition is corrected
"
"When left untreated, shock normally results in death. Early recognition, diagnosis of underlying disease, aggressive treatment, and ongoing monitoring are essential for a good outcome.
"
"The following interventions are required during the recovery process:
"
"Serial testing of organ function, cardiac status, blood pressure, and oxygenation levels
"
"Physical exams
"
"Monitoring of vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate)
"
"Once vital signs, blood pressure, and urine output have returned to normal, most dogs are out of severe crisis. However, these patients are still in critical condition and will likely need prolonged hospitalization.

"Sexual development disorders in dogs occur due to errors in the genetic coding, which involve the chromosomes responsible for development of the sex organs - including the gonads (the male and female reproductive organs) - or when errors in gene development result in abnormal sexual differentiation, making it difficult to distinguish between male and female animals. Sexual disorders tend to be breed specific.
"
"This condition is usually caused by disorders affecting the chromosomes that determine the traits of  a dog's sexual function. Gonadal disorders affect the reproductive organs, and phenotypic  disorders affect the physical and biochemical reproductive properties of the dog. The signs and symptoms of gonadal or reproductive sexual development disorders may include having an unusually large clitoris, for the female, or having an undescended testicle, for the male. Other unusual reproductive organ characteristics may also be present.
"
"Signs and symptoms of chromosomal sexual development disorders may include defects in the number of sex chromosomes. In the process of genetically screening your dog, your veterinarian may find an abnormal number of X or Y chromosomes in your dog's genetic make-up.
"
"Signs and symptoms of phenotypic sexual development disorders may include external  reproductive organs that do not match the internal chromosomes. A dog that carries male chromosomes for example, may appear to have feminine external genitalia, or a smaller than normal penis. Some animals may possess a normal reproductive organ, but also have an additional, sometimes functional, very small second reproductive organ of the opposite gender.
"
"Cardiac dysfunction may be caused by an enlarged or dilated heart muscle, compression of the lining of the heart, outflow obstructions, blood clot, severe heart disease, heartworm disease, or severe arrhythmias.Cardiac pump failure may also be secondary to a systemic disease which causes the myocardial layer (middle layer of the heart) to dysfunction, such as from blood poisoning. The result is low blood pressure and compromised blood flow in the tissues, with reduced tissue oxygen delivery. Cardiogenic shock results from profound impairment of cardiac function, leading to a decrease in stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out of each ventricle during contraction) and cardiac output, congestion of the veins, and narrowing of the blood vessels.
"
"Most causative conditions for cardiogenic shock are associated with markedly depressed left or right ventricle function, but other conditions that can cause cardiac compression and lead to inadequate filling of the ventricles may also play a role. Low cardiac outflow can lead to severely low blood pressure, resulting in diminished blood flow to tissues. Leaking from the pericardium – the sac enclosing the heart - or conditions that cause severe inflow or outflow obstruction to the ventricles are possible culprits. Further, reduced blood flow to the tissues causes organ ischemia (loss of blood to organs) and energy depletion, leading to abnormal organ function. Secondary organs that are affected include the brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidneys. As shock progresses, congestive heart failure may develop. Abnormal rises in left atrial pressure and pulmonary venous pressure may lead to fluid being trapped in the lungs. Any breed, age, or gender can be affected by this condition.
"
"Primary Cardiac Disease
"
"Secondary Cardiac Dysfunction
"
"Risk Factors
"
"Because there are so many possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.
"
"Blood pressure measurement will document low blood pressure, and electrocardiography may aid in the detection of arrhythmias. Pulse oximetry, a procedure using a device which measures oxygen saturation by fluctuations of light absorption in well-vascularized (supplied with blood) tissue during systole (contraction) and diastole (dilation) may reveal low blood pressure.  Blood gas analysis may uncover metabolic acidosis, a decreased pH, and bicarbonate concentration in the body fluids, caused either by an accumulation of acids, or by abnormal losses of fixed base from the body, as in diarrhea or renal disease. A chest x-ray may reveal an enlarged heart or evidence of pulmonary edema (congestive heart failure). Echocardiography may document cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle), disease of a heart valve, limited heart muscle contractability, or pericardial compression.
"
"
"
"If the degree of cardiac dysfunction has progressed to a condition of shock, intensive hospitalized treatment becomes necessary. Drainage of the pericardium is essential for patients displaying compression of the lining of the heart, and fluid therapy will be kept to a minimum until cardiac function is improved. This may be done with the use of positive inotropes, fluid or drug agents that alter the force or energy of muscular contractions; with vasodilators, which relax smooth muscles and widen blood vessels to improve flow; or by decompression of a pericardial (heart sac) leakage, as congestive heart failure may be exacerbated.
"
"Cardiovascular monitoring will be conducted by electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical currents of the heart muscle, and measurement of central venous pressure and blood pressure is useful for determining the effectiveness of the given treatment. Oxygen supplementation is important, as with decreased blood flow, there is a concurrent decrease in oxygen reaching the tissues. Oxygen can be administered by oxygen cage, mask, or nasal tube. In addition, your veterinarian will choose any appropriate drugs to treat your dog's specific condition.
"
"After the initial treatment, your veterinarian will want revisit your dog to monitor heart rate, pulse intensity, mucous membrane color, respiratory rate, lung sounds, urine output, mentation (mental activity), and rectal temperature.

"Sexual development disorders most commonly occur because of inherited traits or because of external causes, like the administration of toxins to the pregnant female parent (such as hormones) during pregnancy. Risk factors may also include the ingestion or administration of male or female hormones, like progesterone, during pregnancy.
"
"These types of disorders are very rare, mainly limited to specific breeds of animals, including Boston terriers and miniature schnauzers. Sexual development disorders are  often apparent from birth, especially if they affect the reproductive organs and involve overly large or small reproductive organs. Individual animals that are normal in appearance, with normal external reproductive organs and abnormal chromosomes, may not be identified until they reach their reproductive years.
"
"Diagnosis may not occur until attempts are made to breed the animal. During this time other diagnoses to rule out may include infertility, hormonal problems, including hypothyroidism, testicular problems, including degeneration, and poor timing during breeding.
"
"Once the above conditions are ruled out, your veterinarian may carry out tests to measure hormone levels, and may conduct tests to define chromosomal sex characteristics to see whether abnormalities exist in the sex chromosomes. Physical tests will include making note of the shape and size of the reproductive organs for comparative purposes, to confirm whether any external abnormalities exist.
"
"Treatment and care will depend on the condition. Some patients will present with skin conditions along with the reproductive sex disorders. In these cases local or topical treatments may provide symptomatic relief. Shampoos or oils may be helpful for topical treatment. In some cases reconstructive surgery may be used to restore a more uniform cosmetic appearance in animals with deformed reproductive organs, especially in male dogs with misshapen genitals.
"
"The removal of an overly large clitoris (part of the female reproductive organ) may be necessary, especially if it is causing trauma to the animal. Sterilization may be necessary for the prevention of later complications, including recurring urinary tract infections.
"
"Most dogs will recover well from surgical and other procedures that are done to improve their cosmetic and physical health. Avoiding synthetic hormones, including progesterone, estrogen, or androgen, may be advised, depending on the type of sexual development disorder your dog has.

"Dogs suffering from compulsive behaviors, separation anxiety, chronic pain and other conditions may benefit from medications that affect the level of serotonin in the body. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, a chemical that works in the brain, and is found in the nervous system. It regulates behavior, awareness of pain, appetite, movement, body temperature, and function of the heart and lungs.
"
"If a dog is taking more than one type of prescription pet medication that causes levels of serotonin to increase in the body, a condition known as serotonin syndrome (SS) can result, and if not caught in time, can lead to death.
"
"As seen in humans, serotonin syndrome in dogs may cause:
"
"Drugs prescribed as antidepressants in humans are becoming more common for use in animals. These medications alter the body’s levels of serotonin, and thus alter mood and behaviors. Some commonly used antidepressant for dogs include buspirone, fluoxetine, and clomipramine.
"
"Serotonin syndrome can be triggered when:
"
"Signs of serotonin syndrome usually come on rapidly in dogs; anywhere from 10 minutes up to four hours after ingestion. 
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct blood tests to figure out if your dog could have an infection, as well as to determine what substances the dog might have eaten. Neurological testing (measuring reflexes and coordination) will also be done to pinpoint a specific area of the nervous system that might be affected, like the brain or spinal cord. There is not a specific test that can be run to tell your veterinarian that serotonin syndrome is to blame. The history of drug ingestion and the signs your dog is showing should lead to the proper diagnosis.
"
"The treatment for serotonin syndrome in dogs is based on keeping the dog stable and sedate. If caught early enough (within 30 minutes), substances like activated charcoal may be given orally to try and reduce the amount of drug the dog will absorb into its system. If your dog is stable enough and it is caught early on, when the drug is still in the stomach cavity, the dog may be made to vomit, or stomach pumping may be done to eliminate the drug from the body.
"
"Signs of this condition will slowly diminish over 24 hours. Your dog will need to be watched closely during this time. Drugs may be given to counteract the serotonin in the body and reduce seizures if they are severe. All medications that will increase serotonin levels in the dog are stopped, and supportive care (e.g., intravenous fluids) will be given. If treated quickly, this condition is less likely to cause death.
"
"Care must be taken when giving an animal medications known to affect serotonin levels in the body. Do not give these medications along with foods that contain L-tryptophan (e.g., dairy products, turkey, red meats, bananas, peanut butter).
"
"Medications that will lead to increased levels of serotonin in the body should not be given to animals that are already taking an antidepressant medication. Your veterinarian should be aware of all medications being given to your dog and choose the drug combinations carefully.

"Ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib) is a condition in which ventricle muscles in the heart begin to contract in a disorganized fashion, making them quiver. Due to this uncoordinated contraction, blood circulation may cease within minutes, which may be fatal. Although it can affect dogs at any age, it seems to affect those that are older.
"
"Unless some underlying infection, metabolic problem, or other such condition is present, the results of routine laboratory tests are usually normal. Your veterinarian will, however, record the ECG (electrocardiogram) results, which is helpful in identifying V-Fib and other related heart problems.
"
"
"
"This is an emergency that requires prompt and aggressive treatment. In fact, without treatment, most dogs die within a matter of minutes. Often, electrical cardioversion is used, wherein an electrical defibrillator is used to deliver small electrical shocks to return the heart to normal rhythm. Initially, low intensity shocks are given; if the heart does not respond, the emergency veterinarian may increase the voltage.
"
"If there is no access to an electrical defribillator, he or she may administer a precordial thump, whereby a sharp blow is applied to the chest wall over the heart with an open fist. Although rarely successful, it may be the only alternative.
"
"Once the dog's heart has returned to a normal rhythm, it will require hospitalization for a few days to fully recover. Regular follow-up exams with the veterinarian will also be required, so that he or she may evaluate the dog's progress (typically with the ECG and other diagnostic procedures).

"Sepsis is the body’s extreme reaction to an infection. Sepsis is a twofold condition—first, the infection, and then the body’s systemic (whole-body) response to the infection. The infection triggers a chain reaction throughout the body, leading to sepsis.
"
"The most common cause is bacterial infection. However, sepsis can also be caused by viruses, parasites, or fungal infections. 
"
"Sepsis is a spectrum of infection. The sequence of severity starts as an uncomplicated bacterial infection in the bloodstream (bacteremia), which can lead to inflammation in the body (systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or SIRS). As organ damage and failure starts to occur (severe sepsis), blood pressure falls, decreasing blood flow and oxygen to the organs, leading to septic shock. Septic shock may continue to the point that the body begins to shut down, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death.  
"
"Sepsis is a medical emergency and should be treated immediately, as it can quickly become life-threatening. You should take your dog immediately to the local emergency veterinary hospital if sepsis is suspected.
"
"Clinical signs may vary based on the type and location of the initial infection, but general symptoms seen with sepsis include:
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Lack of appetite (anorexia)
"
"Weakness/lethargy
"
"Fever
"
"Confusion/disorientation
"
"Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
"
"Rapid breathing (tachypnea)
"
"Low blood pressure (hypotension)
"
"Sepsis is initially caused by an infection that reaches the bloodstream. The most common originating sites of the infection are:
"
"Gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the stomach and intestines: Bacteria and viruses can move from the GI tract into the bloodstream. Viruses such as parvovirus can move from the intestines into the bloodstream. Other possible causes include peritonitis and stomach or intestinal rupture from ulcers, trauma, or a foreign body causing blockage.   
"
"Respiratory tract: Bacterial, viral, or fungal pneumonia can trigger sepsis. 
"
"Oral cavity: Severe dental and periodontal disease can result in significant amounts of bacteria trapped in tartar, which can enter the bloodstream, leading to sepsis. 
"
"Urinary tract: Severe or chronic kidney infection (pyelonephritis) or bladder infection (UTI) can enter the bloodstream and result in sepsis.
"
"Wounds: Skin wounds can become severely infected and serve as the source of sepsis. 
"
"Reproductive tract: Infections in the uterus (pyometra) can result in rupture of the uterus or translocation into the bloodstream. 
"
"While the above-listed locations are the most common sources of sepsis, any infection from bacteria, virus, parasite, or fungus in any location can result in sepsis and trigger the cascade of bodily responses leading to bacteremia, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), severe sepsis, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and death. 
"
"A complete medical history, including any recent wounds, trauma, or surgical procedures as well as current medications (especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, or NSAIDs), may provide clues as to the source of possible sepsis. Next, your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination to assess for abdominal pain, trouble breathing, or fever. 
"
"Any possible source of infection will be investigated. A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will likely be recommended as a starting point. Sepsis can cause changes in your pet’s bloodwork that will aid your veterinarian in the diagnosis. Additional tests such as chest x-rays and an abdominal ultrasound may be recommended to search for the source of infection. Once it is identified, cultures will likely be submitted to determine the exact bacteria or other organism causing the infection, and which antibiotic it is most susceptible to. 
"
"Based on your dog’s history, physical examination, and diagnostic results, your veterinarian will determine a course of treatment. It is extremely likely that your pet will be hospitalized with IV fluids to keep them hydrated, and will be given medications to help maintain blood pressure as well as treat any vomiting, diarrhea, or pain. Antibiotics will also likely be an important part of your pet’s care. Oxygen therapy may be needed if they are having trouble breathing.  
"
"Depending on the source of the infection, some pets diagnosed with sepsis will require emergency surgery to correct the problem underlying the condition. In these cases, exploratory surgery and correction of the underlying problem (such as ruptured intestines or uterus) is crucial to successful treatment of sepsis. Removing the source of the infection, if possible, is an important step before continuing medical management. 
"
"Early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis are vital for a successful outcome and survival. Typically, a dog with sepsis will require three to five days in the hospital, sometimes more, with IV fluids, antibiotics, and nutritional support that may include a feeding tube. Even with intensive care, the survival rate is typically around 50%.    
"
"Most dogs can be discharged when they are fever-free and have normal heart rate and blood pressure. They may be on antibiotics for two to six weeks depending on the source and type of infection. If surgery was performed, a restricted-activity recovery period of 10-–14 days will likely be recommended.
"
"Sepsis is a severe, life-threatening condition that should be treated as soon as possible because it can have deadly consequences. Most dogs that survive tend to make a full recovery and go on to live normal lives.

"Septic arthritis is an infection that occurs in a joint. Septic, in this context, means infected with harmful bacteria (most common), mycobacteria, fungi, or viruses. Arthritis is inflammation in the joint. Usually, septic arthritis occurs trauma, surgery, or a systemic infection in blood that travels to the joints.
"
"Dogs with septic arthritis may quickly experience pain. As bacteria replicates in the joint, it leads to an inflammation that breaks down the joint. Early and often aggressive treatment is required to save the joints from chronic long-term damage.

"Fortunately, septic arthritis is not contagious, though the bacteria that cause septic arthritis may potentially be contagious. While there are many species of bacteria, or even other agents, that can lead to septic arthritis, MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is one of the more contagious and dangerous agents that can spread from pet to pet, pet to human, or human to human.
"
"Septic arthritis is rarely seen in dogs. Most that are affected with septic arthritis have had a penetrating injury to the joint, a recent orthopedic surgery where the joint was opened, or a suppressed immune system.
"
"Septic arthritis is a medical emergency and should be immediately addressed. Early intervention is important to minimize joint damage.
"
"Clinical signs of septic arthritis are both systemic—from the infection in the bloodstream—and local, from pain in the joint itself. The most common symptoms in dogs:
"
"Lameness or pain in one or more joints
"
"Heat or swelling in the joint
"
"Decreased or absent appetite
"
"Lethargy
"
"Fever
"
"Septic arthritis is usually the result of a penetrating trauma, a complication of orthopedic surgery, or a systemic bacterial infection concentrated in the joint.
"
"Dogs that have had a recent trauma, such as an animal bite over the joint or a puncture wound near the joint, are at greater risk of developing septic arthritis. All puncture wounds, especially if they’re near the joint, should be thoroughly cleaned.
"
"Contact your veterinarian immediately if your dog has a puncture wound near the joint, as the vet may want to do additional flushing of the wound and prescribe antibiotics.
"
"While sterile technique is always rigorously observed during orthopedic surgery in a dog, sometimes postoperative complications do occur. If your dog has had a recent orthopedic surgery, such as a ruptured cruciate ligament repaired or a bone plate or bone pin inserted, they have an inherent risk for developing an infection of the bone or joint after surgery.
"
"Even the best surgeons using the best sterile technique in the best surgical suites cannot offer zero risk of postoperative infections. Airborne bacteria can still lead to an infected implant, and consequently, to an infected joint.
"
"Diseases that suppress a dog’s immune system can increase a dog’s risk of developing septic arthritis. Additionally, there are cases of young animals spontaneously developing septic arthritis without trauma. Middle-aged, large-breed dogs have been documented to spontaneously develop septic arthritis in elbows that have underlying arthritic changes as well.
"
"To diagnose septic arthritis, your veterinarian will start with a thorough physical exam. They will touch and examine any potentially affected joints and do a gait evaluation to assess for lameness. Heat or swelling of one or more joints is the most common clinical sign of septic arthritis. Your vet will also want to assess your dog’s overall state. Sometimes dogs with this condition will run a fever.
"
"Your veterinarian will likely want to run some blood work to screen for signs that the infection is systemic (in the bloodstream). Additionally, x-rays are helpful to rule out other common underlying orthopedic conditions that can also affect the joint, like fractures. Some cases of septic arthritis can be accompanied by osteomyelitis, a bone infection. This often leads to changes to the underlying bone that are visible on x-rays.
"
"After a physical exam, bloodwork, and x-rays, your veterinarian may want to do a procedure called arthrocentesis, also known as a joint aspiration or joint tap. This procedure involves using a sterile needle to collect joint fluid and cells to look at under the microscope. The fluid can also be sent off to a microbiology lab to culture for bacteria. Your dog will be given anesthetics to ensure that the procedure is pain-free.
"
"If these tests do not provide answers, additional imaging like ultrasonography or a computed tomography (CT) scan may be recommended.
"
"Treatment of septic arthritis often involves aggressive therapy with antibiotics. If your dog is systemically ill and very sick when diagnosed, they may need to be hospitalized until they are stable. Sometimes these patients require lavage, or flushing with sterile saline, of the affected joints.
"
"Often, patients with septic arthritis will be placed on oral antibiotics for a lengthy time. Follow-up visits to recheck the joints are recommended. Your veterinarian may need to repeat some of the previous diagnostics to ensure that the infection is resolving and that your dog is on the right track to recovery.
"
"Monitor your pet closely while they’re undergoing treatment at home for septic arthritis. Note any changes in their comfort, gait, and appetite. Sometimes antibiotics can lead to gastrointestinal upset, so closely monitor your dog’s appetite and stools while on medication.
"
"Follow the instructions on the label and do not discontinue an antibiotic prematurely unless instructed to do so by your veterinarian. Be sure to inform your veterinarian about any changes you notice in your dog’s response to treatment. Consider talking to your veterinarian about adding a probiotic while on antibiotics to keep a healthy gastrointestinal biome.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend rest while your dog is healing from septic arthritis. Be sure to ask about any activity restrictions. If your dog is not limping, low-impact exercise such as 15-minute slow walks is encouraged to maintain joint health. If your dog is still favoring, your veterinarian may recommend restricted activity to allow the joint time to rest.
"
"Your veterinarian may prescribe an anti-inflammatory drug for your dog that helps ease pain and inflammation. Sometimes these medications can make dogs feel better and want to be more active than they should be during recovery. If your vet recommends your pet should rest, be sure to follow this recommendation even if your dog appears to feel better. Remember that their joint may not be healed yet, even though their pain is controlled.
"
"Once your dog has been cleared to return to normal activity, physical therapy is geared toward a gradual return to full function and range of motion. Your veterinarian may recommend slow walks at first; you might start taking 10-minute walks and doing a slow serpentine pattern in the yard to strengthen the knees. Then, after a week or two of 10-minute walks, increase the walks to 15 minutes. Usually stairs, jumping, and running are the last activities to be added back in before your dog is back to normal.
"
"Other physical therapy may include various range-of-motion exercises, such as moving your pet’s joints in a natural motion. A common exercise for the knees is moving the rear legs in a gentle circular motion, like pedaling a bicycle, while your pet is in a supported position. Your veterinarian is the best person to discuss a physical therapy plan for your dog, as plans will vary depending on the nature and severity of the infection, the age of the dog, and which joint(s) are involved.
"
"Recovery times depend on:
"
"Severity of the joint infection
"
"Number and location of affected joint(s)
"
"Whether the infection is localized or systemic
"
"Time period between infection and start of treatment
"
"Individual response to therapy
"
"Because so many factors can affect recovery time, it is difficult to predict duration. However, most patients can recover and return to full function in 4-12 weeks.
"
"Most cases of septic arthritis are considered “cured” rather than just “managed” once they have resolved. However, having septic arthritis once does not mean your dog will never have it again.
"
"Remember, if your dog sustains an injury that may involve the joint, be sure to get them appropriate care as soon as possible. If your dog has orthopedic surgery, follow all post-operative instructions and be open in your communication with your veterinarian to reduce your pet’s risk of post-operative complications.

"The retina is the innermost lining of the eyeball. Retinal detachment refers to its separation from the back of the eyeball. This can be caused by a variety of genetic and non-genetic factors, and in some cases is a result of a more serious underlying medical condition. There are some forms of treatment, although retinal detachment may lead to permanent blindness.
"
"The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how retinal detachment affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Dogs experiencing a detached retina may show signs of blindness or reduced vision. In some cases, the dog's iris may stay dilated and will not adjust properly when exposed to light.
"
"While retinal detachment can happen in any breed and at any age, it is more common in older dogs. Some animals are born with congenital defects that cause retinal detachment to occur immediately or in the long term. If both retinas are detached, it is most likely a sign of a more serious underlying medical condition. Glaucoma, for instance, is one such condition. Exposure to certain toxins can also cause the retina to detach.
"
"High blood pressure (hypertension) in dogs has been shown to be causative factor for retinal detachment. Other metabolic causes can include hyperthyroidism, characterized by increased levels of thyroid hormone; hyperproteinemia, which is increased protein in the blood; and hypoxia, low levels of oxygen present in the body's tissues. Other causes can include trauma to the eyes, ocular neoplasia (tumor growth on the eye), and inflammation of the blood vessels in and surrounding the eye.
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct a full eye exam, and order a complete blood work-up to examine whether the retinal detachment is due to a more serious underlying medical condition.
"
"
"
"Treatment for a detached retina will be determined based on the severity and cause of the medical condition. There are some surgical techniques that are available to reattach the retina, and there are also techniques that can assist in the regeneration of retinal tissue.
"
"If surgery is deemed unnecessary, your veterinarian will treat the underlying medical cause for the retinal detachment by prescribing your dog medication.
"
"Your veterinarian will recommend that you restrict the dog's activity post-surgery. There are several possible complications that can occur, including blindness, cloudy lens formation (cataract), glaucoma, and chronic eye pain. In order to quickly identify these complications, your veterinarian will monitor your dog's blood cell counts and recommend frequent follow-up exams.
"
"It is also possible that the retina cannot be reattached, or that the dog's blindness is irreversible. In these cases, your veterinarian may equip you with lifestyle management training skills to improve the overall quality of life for your pet.
"
"There are currently no known preventive measures for a detached retina.

"Seborrhea in dogs is a condition that affects keratin in the skin. Keratin is a protein that gives skin and hair its form.
"
"In canine seborrhea, keratin is produced in the wrong amounts—either too much or not enough. Seborrhea causes dogs to have a coat of hair that’s dry and lackluster or greasy.
"
"Seborrhea in dogs can be what veterinarians call “primary” or “secondary.”
"
"Primary seborrhea is a genetic disease that always causes the dog to produce abnormal keratin.
"
"American Cocker Spaniels, West Highland White Terriers, English Springer Spaniels, and Basset Hounds are the most common breeds to have primary seborrhea, but any dog can have this condition.
"
"With secondary seborrhea, an underlying issue is causing your dog to make abnormal keratin. 
"
"Health issues that can cause secondary seborrhea include:
"
"Hormonal imbalances
"
"Allergies
"
"Vitamin deficiencies
"
"Immune-mediated diseases such as lupus 
"
"Lymphoma of the skin
"
"Possible symptoms of seborrhea in dogs are:
"
"Very dry, dull coat
"
"Dandruff
"
"Greasy, oily skin that smells bad
"
"Crusted, plaque-like (rough and scaly) skin lesions
"
"Itching that ranges from mild to severe
"
"Large amount of earwax and ear debris
"
"Generally, all the skin is affected by seborrhea, but the folds of skin between the toes, in the armpits, on the belly and perineum (the area under a dog’s tail), and at the bottom of the neck are usually worse.
"
"Dogs with lots of skin folds, like Basset Hounds, usually experience more affected skin in those folds.
"
"
"
" 
"
"The cause of a dog’s seborrhea depends on whether it’s primary or secondary.
"
"Primary seborrhea is a congenital, genetic disease that typically starts at a young age and gets worse as your dog gets older. West Highland White Terriers, Basset Hounds, American Cocker Spaniels, and English Springer Spaniels are most commonly affected.
"
"Diseases and other health issues that can cause secondary seborrhea in dogs include:
"
"Skin allergies to fleas, food, and the environment
"
"Hypothyroidism, caused by an underactive thyroid gland
"
"Cushing’s disease, caused by an overactive adrenal gland
"
"Diabetes mellitus
"
"Mites and lice
"
"Autoimmune diseases like pemphigus foliaceus, sebaceous adenitis, and lupus erythematosus
"
"A type of cancer called cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma
"
"Vitamin deficiencies like zinc-responsive dermatosis and vitamin A-responsive dermatosis
"
"Diagnosis of seborrhea starts with a physical examination by your veterinarian to check your dog’s skin and look for other symptoms.
"
"You will also be asked how long it has been happening, if your dog has been scratching, and if there are any changes in your dog’s food and water intake.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform testing to determine the cause of your dog’s skin condition. The following tests could help:
"
"A skin scraping to test for mites and lice
"
"An impression cytology (collection) of skin and ear debris to test for a yeast or bacterial infection that looks like seborrhea, such as Malassezia yeast
"
"A blood chemistry panel to screen for diabetes or Cushing’s disease (your vet will need further tests to confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment)
"
"A blood test for thyroid hormone levels to determine whether your dog has hypothyroidism
"
"A biopsy to look for autoimmune disease or cancer
"
"Based on the test results, your veterinarian will have a better understanding of what is causing your dog’s seborrhea. The most important aspect of seborrhea treatment is treating any underlying conditions.
"
"Hypothyroidism: If your dog has hypothyroidism, they are treated with hormone replacement, an oral medication called levothyroxine that your dog will take for the rest of their life.
"
"Cushing’s disease: Treatment of Cushing’s disease involves lifelong medication called Vetoryl. 
"
"Diabetes: Treatment of diabetes requires daily insulin injections. 
"
"Cancer or autoimmune disease: If a biopsy shows that your dog has autoimmune disease or cancer, they will be started on medication to manage the disease, or your veterinarian may refer you to a specialist. 
"
"Lice or mites: If a skin scraping finds lice or mites, the veterinarian will put your dog on medication to kill the parasites.
"
"Fleas: If your dog has fleas, a monthly flea preventative will curb flea allergies that can cause or worsen seborrhea.
"
"Vitamin deficiency: If your veterinarian suspects vitamin A-responsive dermatitis or zinc-responsive dermatitis, they will recommend additional vitamins in your dog’s diet. 
"
"Food allergy: If your veterinarian suspects a primary food allergy, they may recommend a hypoallergenic food trial.
"
"Infection: If your dog has an infection that developed because of seborrhea, then the infection must be treated. Your dog will require a three- to four-week course of oral antibiotics and/or antifungals. 
"
"To treat the seborrhea itself, your dog needs frequent baths with anti-seborrheic shampoos, typically every 2 or 3 days to start with. These shampoos typically contain coal tar and salicylic acid.
"
"Frequent bathing is continued for 2-3 weeks or longer, until the skin improves. The goal of bathing is to remove excess keratin. Depending on how your dog responds to treatment, bathing frequency may decrease to every 1 to 2 weeks, or it may stay at every 2 to 3 days.
"
"Additionally, you will need to clean your dog’s ears with a medicated ear cleaner every 2 to 3 days. If there is an infection in the ears, your veterinarian will prescribe an ear medication as well. 
"
"Your dog may also be started on prednisone to decrease inflammation and debris buildup. Regular rechecks with your veterinarian, typically every one to three weeks, are important to monitor how your dog is responding to treatment.
"
"Recovery and management depend on the cause of the seborrhea. If a primary cause of seborrhea can be found, managing the primary disease is key. 
"
"It can take several weeks for the signs of seborrhea to resolve, and the primary disease-causing seborrhea will need to be managed for life.
"
"It is also important to understand that once seborrhea is present, abnormal keratin placement in the skin will continue to occur.
"
"Using anti-seborrheic shampoos and ear cleaners on a schedule recommended by your vet for the rest of your dog’s life may help to decrease keratin buildup and prevent infections. 
"
"As your pup recovers, your vet may recommend soothing hot spot ointments such as Silver Honey® Ointment Spay, and Douoxo® Shampoo to provide relief. Your vet may also recommend additional topical wipes, or sprays as well.
"
"If your dog gets itchier or develops skin lesions, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"Management of seborrhea often requires a lifelong routine of bathing and ear cleaning, but with consistent treatment, your dog can enjoy a good quality of life.
"
"After seeing a vet to confirm your dog’s diagnosis, you can treat seborrhea at home by using an anti-seborrheic shampoo containing coal tar and salicylic acid.
"
"Home treatment also includes bathing your dog every 2 to 7 days on a schedule set by your vet. You will also clean your dog’s ears with a medicated ear cleaner every 2 to 3 days.
"
"If an underlying health issue is causing your dog’s seborrhea, you’ll need to follow all treatment protocols for that illness to ensure the seborrhea is properly managed.
"
"If your dog’s seborrhea is not improving, however, take them to the veterinarian. They might have developed bacterial and yeast infections of the skin and ears that require a prescription medication.
"
"Yes, it can cause hair loss.
"
"Seborrhea can smell very badly, like grease, corn chips, or a strong doggy scent.
"
"No, seborrhea is not contagious to other dogs or humans.

"Sebaceous adenitis (SA) is a disease that affects the oil glands of a dog’s skin. The sebaceous glands are spread out beneath a dog's skin and produce a substance called sebum. Sebum helps to keep a dog’s skin and coat moisturized, soft, and healthy.
"
"Dogs affected by SA are missing this sebum and end up with hair coat changes, hair loss, scaling, and dandruff. They also often have secondary skin infections.
"
"SA may look different depending on if the affected dog has long hair or short hair. Long haired dogs tend to lose hair symmetrically on either side of the body, have dry, brittle hair coats, and have hair that mats and clumps together with scales. Conversely, short-haired dogs often have small flaky dandruff all over their body, starting at their head, with patchy hair loss.
"
"Fortunately, SA is not a very common disease for most dogs. However, it’s more common in certain breeds like Standard Poodles and Akitas, who can inherit the condition.
"
"Sebaceous adenitis is not considered a medical emergency and can be addressed with your regular veterinarian during office hours.
"
"Symptoms of sebaceous adenitis in dogs include:
"
"Dry, brittle hair coat
"
"Scaly skin
"
"Dandruff
"
"Hair loss
"
"Itching (40% of patients)
"
"Thickened, scarred skin
"
"Reddish tint to hair coat
"
"Tufts of matted hair
"
"Moth-eaten appearance to hair coat
"
"Secondary bacterial skin infections
"
"Greasy skin
"
"Pigmented, dark discoloration to skin
"
"While we don’t know the exact cause of sebaceous adenitis, it is believed to be immune-mediated, meaning that the dog’s own immune system is attacking the sebaceous glands in their skin.
"
"This immune-mediated condition is genetic. SA is inherited from affected parents by a recessive gene in Standard Poodles and Akitas. Other breeds that have shown a higher risk of developing SA include Chow Chows, Samoyeds, Havanese, and Vizslas, but any dog can get sebaceous adenitis.
"
"The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) has a national registry of purebred dogs affected with sebaceous adenitis. This helps to track the genetic lines associated with the trait to improve the breed over time. If your dog is diagnosed with SA, it is recommended that you register them with this organization.
"
"Sebaceous adenitis is diagnosed with results of a skin biopsy, obtained surgically with your dog under anesthesia. If this test is recommended, withhold food and water beginning the midnight before your pet goes in for their biopsy.
"
"Prior to a skin biopsy, your veterinarian will likely recommend several other tests to rule out more common conditions that present similarly to SA. They will likely start with a physical exam followed by skin scrapes. They may pluck hairs from your dog to look under the microscope or do fungal or bacterial skin cultures to rule out secondary skin infections. Bloodwork may be recommended to rule out underlying hypothyroidism.
"
"Be sure to let your vet know if your dog is itchy. Secondary skin infections with yeast and bacteria often occur in these patients. Patients with concurrent allergies may require additional medications to get their skin under control.
"
"If your dog has been treated in the past by another vet for skin issues, let your vet know which meds they’ve tried and how much they helped—or didn’t help.
"
"SA is not curable, but it can be managed with lifelong therapy. It's treated by a combination of topical products, oral supplements, and medications.
"
"What works for one dog may not work for another. Be open and communicate with your vet to let them know what is working or not working for your dog.
"
"Topical products are a common place to start with managing sebaceous adenitis. Your vet may prescribe a medicated shampoo containing sulfur and/or salicylic acid, like Virbac Keratolux®. Sometimes dilute propylene glycol daily sprays or weekly baby oil soaks are recommended.
"
"Oral supplementation with omega fatty acids, vitamin A, and niacinamide (a form of vitamin B) may be recommended.
"
"Oral medications may be prescribed in more serious cases. Dogs with secondary bacterial or yeast skin infections may be prescribed antibiotics or antifungal medications.
"
"The antibiotic doxycycline may help the immune system respond to this disease. However, antibiotic resistance can become an issue with chronic use.
"
"Dogs with severe SA may be put on cyclosporine products such as Atopica® to help regulate the immune system's attack on the sebaceous glands.
"
"Some dogs on this medication may even experience regeneration of some of their sebaceous glands. Sometimes steroids or retinoids are prescribed, requiring more frequent follow-up visits to gauge response and monitor other systems during treatment. 
"
"If your dog is on long-term prescription medications for SA, they will likely need to be seen by their vet regularly for rechecks. Dogs on isotretinoin should initially have their liver values checked every two weeks. Schirmer Tear Tests should also be done to ensure they are still making tears normally, as this medication can impact tear-making inability.
"
"Dogs on long-term steroids or cyclosporine should also have regular bloodwork to ensure their liver and kidneys are metabolizing the drugs without any issues.
"
"Routine bathing with medicated shampoo or baby oil is a part of maintenance for many of these dogs for the rest of their life.
"
"In mild cases, consider topical long-acting topical omega fatty acid products like Dermoscent® Essential 6 Spot-On if you struggle to give your dog daily oral omega fatty acid capsules.
"
"Unfortunately, SA is not preventable. Since it’s an inherited disease, the only way to prevent the condition is to avoid breeding affected dogs. Because this condition is recessive, it may skip a generation and be missed in breeding animals.
"
"SA is generally not painful in dogs; it is more of a cosmetic condition. Dogs with severe skin infections secondary to SA may become lethargic or itchy.
"
"SA is not considered to be a terminal condition.
"
"Mild cases of SA can be managed with omega fatty acid oral supplements, keratolytic shampoos, and emollient rinses.

"Separation anxiety in dogs is a behavioral disorder characterized by anxiety and distress when a dog is away from their pet parent. The condition typically occurs when a pet parent leaves, and it often includes excessive excitement, clingy behavior, and restlessness upon the pet parent’s return. 
"
"Seasonal flank alopecia is a skin condition that occurs in dogs. The flanks on a dog refer to the side areas behind the chest and in front of the legs, and alopecia means the loss of hair. In seasonal flank alopecia, there are patches of hair loss along either or both sides of the dog. This is typically during the winter, but it can occur during other months. 
"
"Although hair loss can start in different months, most commonly the onset is between November and March in the Northern Hemisphere because of reduced daylight, with hair regrowth occurring spontaneously three to eight months later.
"
"Other than the hair loss itself, the condition does not cause the dog discomfort, itchiness, or irritation. In some dogs, repeated episodes will result in an increase in hair loss and longer time until the hair regrows.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Hair loss on either or both sides of the dog
"
"Areas of hair loss can be even or uneven on both sides
"
"Areas of hair loss are well defined
"
"In the areas of hair loss, the skin will sometimes become darker (hyperpigmented)
"
"Hair loss occurs in cycles
"
"Unfortunately, there is no known cause for the condition, but research shows that it is likely related to the shorter days and longer nights that occur during the fall and winter months. Because of the shortened days, hormonal changes (such as melatonin and prolactin) would normally trigger the growth of a thick, winter coat. However, in dogs with seasonal flank alopecia, this does not happen.
"
"Typically, the condition is first seen in dogs 1 to 6 years old, and will continue throughout the dog’s life. The most affected breeds are Boxers, English Bulldogs, Airedale Terriers, and Schnauzers, but it can be seen in any pure or mixed breed.  
"
"In recurring cases, the diagnosis is relatively simple based on history; however, it’s important to rule out other diseases first. Your vet may want to rule out other conditions such as skin infections (pyoderma), demodectic mange, ringworm (dermaphytosis), endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism, and Cushing’s disease.
"
"Separation anxiety is one of the most common behavioral disorders in dogs.  The condition affects not only the dog but also the pet parent, and can put a strain on the human-animal bond.
"
"Separation anxiety can cause severe stress and emotional trauma for the dog, and often results in environmental and household damage and costly repairs for their pet parents.
"
"Dogs with separation anxiety show symptoms in the absence of their pet parent, and often prior to their departure.
"
"Common symptoms of separation anxiety in dogs include:
"
"Clingy behavior
"
"Decreased activity
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Destructive behaviors, such as:
"
"Chewing
"
"Scratching
"
"Destroying household objects
"
"Self-trauma or mutilation
"
"Restless behavior, such as:
"
"Panting
"
"Pacing
"
"Salivating
"
"Shivering or trembling
"
"Urination or defecation in the home (house soiling)
"
"Vocalization, such as howling, barking, or whining
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"The exact cause of separation anxiety in dogs is not usually known. However, genetic and environmental factors or early negative experiences in a pup’s life may contribute to the development of separation anxiety.
"
"Such factors might include:
"
"The attitude and actions of a pet parent toward the dog, such as negative reinforcement or punishment
"
"Changes in the family dynamic, such as the death of a family member
"
"Rehoming
"
"Transition of a pet parent from staying home to working outside the home
"
"If the dog’s history is unknown, or to definitively confirm the diagnosis, your vet may want to perform a skin biopsy. This involves having your pet sedated and given a local pain blocker. A small area of skin will be removed and sent to a lab for a board-certified veterinary pathologist to examine. Using a microscope, they’re looking for characteristic patterns such as abnormal and reduced growth of hair follicles filled with keratin and a classic “branching” pattern.
"
"Since dogs with this condition are otherwise healthy—and because it’s a cosmetic condition, most dogs will only need to be observed over time. This is to ensure symptoms are not getting worse or there are additional symptoms along with the hair loss.
"
"Melatonin is typically the treatment of choice. A critical aspect in successful treatment is starting melatonin one month prior to the expected time of hair loss (before the onset of winter). Melatonin can be given orally or as a compounded injection. There is also a third option, a melatonin implant. But some dogs can have an adverse reaction, causing an abscess on their skin.
"
"Chat with your veterinarian or board-certified veterinary dermatologist for recommendations on oral melatonin. Supplements are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which means there can be a difference in its effectiveness.

"The outlook for hair regrowth can vary. In some dogs, hair completely regrows. But other dogs may have incomplete regrowth, or a different color and texture of hair in the affected area.

Hair regrowth can start spontaneously about three to eight months after hair loss starts, but the cyclical pattern is variable between animals. As the hair loss cycle becomes obvious, treatment can be started about a month prior to the anticipated hair loss.
"
"In most cases, seasonal flank alopecia will last during winter months, and as the days start to lengthen, it can self-resolve; however, there are cases where dogs will continue to cycle, and around age 6 or 7 will have progressively less hair regrowth due to age.
"
"Seasonal flank alopecia should not cause any discomfort or irritation; it is a cosmetic disease that does not affect the dog’s quality of life.

"Older dogs are more likely to develop separation anxiety, since they are less able to cope with changes in their surroundings. 
"
"Since separation anxiety in dogs is a behavioral disorder, there is no specific test your veterinarian can use to diagnose the condition.
"
"Videos and descriptions of your dog’s behavior are typically most helpful in helping the vet identify and evaluate symptoms that occur and worsen in your absence. An indoor pet camera can be used to document such behavior and help your vet reach an accurate diagnosis. 
"
"In addition, your veterinarian may perform tests including blood work, urine testing, and hormone tests—such as a thyroid panel—to rule out other conditions, since symptoms are often vague and may be attributed to an underlying disease. For instance, pain from arthritis can manifest as restlessness, and urinary accidents can be caused by a urinary tract infection.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to ensure your pup has healthy organ function if and when medication is needed. 
"
"Early recognition, intervention, and treatment are important to prevent symptoms of separation anxiety in dogs from worsening.
"
"Multiple forms of management are available for separation anxiety in dogs. However, not all of them will be effective for your pup and it’s important to work with your veterinarian or a veterinary behaviorist to create an effective treatment plan.
"
"You will also need to provide frequent updates about your dog’s progress so adjustments to the treatment plan can be made as needed.
"
"Behavior modification is the foundation of separation anxiety treatment and requires time, effort, and patience from you and your dog. Be consistent. Never punish your dog—this will only increase their anxiety and worsen unwanted behaviors. 
"
"A consistent daily routine can help your dog establish expectations for when they will receive attention and when they will be alone.
"
"Teach your dog calming behaviors, such as “settle,” by rewarding them for relaxing in a specific location, such as a mat or crate, and gradually increasing the amount of time they spend there.
"
"Training should focus not only on the behavioral response (such as “sit,” “lie down,” or “stay,”) but also on your dog’s emotional state, emphasizing calm and relaxed behavior. Reward behavioral characteristics such as relaxed facial muscles, regular and slow breathing, sitting with one leg tucked under their body, and positioning the ears to the side or forward.
"
"Desensitizing your dog to pre-departure cues can also help reduce their anxiety. These
"
"cues—such as picking up your car keys, packing your lunch, or putting on your shoes—are the behaviors youexhibit prior to leaving.
"
"These actions can be a significant source of distress for your dog. You can help decrease your dog’s anxiety by changing up your routine, performing these actions when you are not leaving, or avoiding as many of them as possible.
"
"You can also offer your dog a special treat to help distract them as you are preparing to leave.
"
"Ultimately, the goal of behavioral modification is to teach your dog that being alone is not a bad thing. To increase their confidence, gradually increase the amount of time your dog spends alone. This requires patience and is often the most challenging part of behavior modification. 
"
"Pheromones or nutraceuticals can help your dog relax in your absence. Examples of pheromone products include:
"
"Adaptil®: These products contain dog-appeasing pheromone (DAP), which mimics the soothing effect of a nursing dog
"
"Solliquin®: This product contains a blend of plant extracts and other relaxing ingredients that have been shown to help calm dogs
"
"Rescue Remedy®: This is a more natural stress relief option that is added to your dog’s drinking water
"
"Medications are not suitable for all dogs and aren’t considered a cure. However, when used in addition to a training program, medications can help relieve the fear of being alone. Moreover, some medications improve a dog’s ability to learn new tasks. 
"
"Commonly prescribed medications include:
"
"Alprazolam
"
"Trazodone
"
"Fluoxetine
"
"Clomipramine
"
"Some medications are more effective in the short term, whereas others require several weeks before the behaviors improve. Adhere to your veterinarian’s guidelines and keep all recheck appointments for your pup, as many of these medications require monitoring and should not be suddenly discontinued. 
"
"It’s important to limit a dog’s ability to hurt themselves or their surroundings.
"
"A crate can be helpful but may worsen your dog’s anxiety if they are hesitant. Never force your dog to use their crate.
"
"Create a safe space for your pup by:
"
"Ignore your dog prior to leaving and upon arrival so you don’t reinforce their excitement and excessive attachment to you. Exercising your dog for 30 minutes prior to leaving and ignoring them for 10 minutes after you return can help them calm down. 
"
"Manage absences by minimizing the time your dog spends alone. For example, you may be able to:
"
"Complete recovery of separation anxiety in dogs can be quite challenging, and behavioral modification can be taxing for pet parents.
"
"Although studies show the effectiveness of certain medications for separation anxiety, every dog is different and different responses to treatment can occur, so a trial period may be necessary to determine an effective medication and dose.
"
"It’s important to partner with your veterinarian or veterinary behaviorist, as routine monitoring will be necessary to ensure your dog’s anxiety is well managed.
"
"Over time, you should be able to spend more time away from your dog, and they should exhibit fewer symptoms upon your departure, arrival, and while you’re away. 
"
"Unfortunately, there’s no exact timeline for when to expect your dog’s behavior to improve, since each dog is different. Treatment can be demanding of your time and patience, and even when all efforts have been exhausted, treatment may be ineffective in severe cases. Humane euthanasia may be required in cases where the dog is hurting themself or others.
"
"Separation anxiety in dogs is not completely preventable, but teaching your dog to spend time alone can help prevent them from becoming overly attached to you. Be aware of how much time you spend with your dog and how you act before leaving and upon arrival. 
"
"When you bring home a new puppy, socialize them and teach them how to spend time by themselves. Start early and use positive reinforcement to reward behaviors you want to continue. Never use any form of negative reinforcement or punishment.
"
"If a sudden schedule change is necessary, such as having to go back into the office after working from home, or you anticipate a major lifestyle change, such as getting married or divorced, you may see a shift in your dogs’ behavior.
"
"If possible, gradually acclimate them to the change, instead of expecting them to adapt suddenly.

"A dog’s backbone (spinal column) is composed of many smaller bones known as vertebrae, which are connected by spongy intervertebral discs and groups of muscles (paraspinal muscles).
"
"Together, they allow movement, stabilization, and protection of the spine and spinal cord. Scoliosis often occurs as a congenital birth defect. The spinal column develops an abnormal curvature or position.
"
"While scoliosis in dogs is uncommon, it can be acquired due to certain diseases and trauma. It can affect any portion of the spinal column, including the cervical (neck), thoracic (mid-back), and lumbar (lower back) regions, and is characterized by three types:
"
"Sarcoptic mange is a contagious skin disease caused by mites located at the hair follicles and can be transmitted from animals to humans. Sarcoptic mange can be an extremely debilitating and sometimes even fatal disease. 
"
"Sarcoptic mange, which is also known as scabies, is caused by Sarcoptes scabiei. Under the microscope, this parasite appears as a small, circular, white mite. Adult mites have eight legs while juveniles have six legs. Terminal suckers are located on the legs of male and female mites, which help them feed on a host’s skin. They are usually 0.2-0.4 millimeters in size and cannot be seen by the naked eye.  
"
"This parasitic mite is easily transmitted between animals as well as to humans. These mites are found on foxes primarily and are an important reason for domestic dog infestation. Dogs develop an allergic reaction to these mites, so only a few are necessary to cause severe clinical signs.  
"
"Adult mites will mate on the skin surface, and then the females burrow into the deeper skin layers to lay their eggs. Once these eggs hatch, the larvae move toward the skin’s surface where they begin to feed on the skin. Larvae then mature to nymphs, which eventually mature to adults. The life cycle is complete within 3 weeks.  
"
"Scabies usually affects dogs suffering from starvation and neglect and those with compromised immune systems. It is seen less commonly in healthy dogs in loving homes.  
"
"Clinical signs of sarcoptic mange include: 
"
"Severe itching 
"
"Alopecia (hair loss) 
"
"The causative agent of sarcocystosis (Sarcocystis) is the same organism that causes equine protozoal meningitis. It is believe dogs can become infected with Sarcocystis; however, symptoms of disease in infected dogs are rare.
"
"Sarcocystosis can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of infection affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"Symptoms in dogs are rarely seen but may include:
"
"A dog may be infected by eating raw meat contaminated with Sarcocystis organisms.
"
"Occasionally, Sarcocystis organisms can be seen in the feces on microscopic fecal examination. However, in most instances, diagnosis is accomplished by finding the organism on histopathology in tissues such as the lungs, liver, kidney, spleen, brain and/or muscle.
"
"More specialized testing such as immunohistochemistry and PCR may be available at some research facilities but are not widely available outside of a research setting.
"
"
"
"No definitive treatment for sarcocystosis exists. Treatments such as clindamycin or sulfadiazine may be tried if sarcocystosis is suspected or diagnosed.
"
"Do not allow your dog to eat raw or uncooked meat.

"Torticollis—This is seen as a lateral curvature of the cervical vertebral column.
"
"Kyphosis—An abnormal flexion of the thoracolumbar (mild-lower) spine, which may occur secondary to pain referred from the abdomen or in dogs with intervertebral disc disease (IVDD).
"
"Lordosis—Much less common in dogs, this manifests as a downward curvature of the spine and is often secondary to diseases of the paraspinal muscles.
"
"Dogs with scoliosis are at a higher risk of spinal cord compression, which can result in pain and a range of neurological problems. These problems can vary in severity, including limb weakness and an uncoordinated gait.
"
"Fortunately, for many affected dogs, scoliosis is not painful. Because of this, scoliosis in dogs is usually not treated as a medical emergency. 
"
"Usually, the first noticeable symptom of scoliosis in dogs is a deviation in the dog’s spine. It may curve to the left or right, or your dog’s back may appear to be hunched. Since scoliosis can also occur due to trauma or underlying neurologic diseases, your dog may experience additional symptoms, including:
"
"Pain
"
"Forelimb or hind limb weakness
"
"Lameness
"
"Uncoordinated walk (ataxia)
"
"Fever
"
"Head hanging low
"
"Crossing of the limbs
"
"Rib deformities
"
"Unwillingness to play, run, or jump
"
"Abnormal posture
"
"Stiffness in the neck or back
"
" Excoriations (self-inflicted superficial or deep wounds)
"
"Raised bumps called papules are often found on the chest or over the body. Thick crusted skin is most noted on the margins of the ears, the ankles (hocks), armpits, and elbows as this mite prefers to invade hairless skin. But these mites can affect the entire body.  
"
"Often secondary skin infections are seen because of the skin lesions, which can present as crusted lesions (collarettes) or draining/weeping wounds.  
"
"Depression, decreased appetite, and lethargy can occur because of the severe itching and uncomfortable skin issues. Weight loss is a possible clinical sign because of the expended energy used with persistent and severe scratching. Enlarged lymph nodes can be seen with generalized infection. Occasionally, localized scabies infection is possible when the lesions, hair loss, and itching is confined to one region of the body.  
"
"It is important to note that with cases of sudden, severe itching in dogs, especially in younger dogs, scabies should always be investigated and treated to avoid progression of symptoms. 
"
"Sarcoptic mange is spread through direct contact with an infected animal or human. These microscopic mites require a host to feed on and do not live in the environment for long periods of time. They can be infective in the environment for up to 36 hours.  
"
"Scabies is often transmitted through close contact between dogs. These mites are found most in areas where infected dogs and foxes frequent. Day cares, dog parks, shelters, and some breeding facilities are examples of where dogs can easily spread scabies.  
"
"Scabies is not caused by bad hygiene, but it can be worsened with neglect or a weaker immune system. Animals with depressed or forming immune systems or animals with other underlying medical issues are at a higher risk of mange infestation.  
"
"Scabies is often suspected in any dog with sudden onset of severe itching, hair loss, or scaling lesions, especially puppies and older, ill dogs. 
"
"Sarcoptic mange is most commonly diagnosed with skin scraping and cytology. This is a non-invasive test that involves using a scalpel blade and scraping the skin deep enough for mild irritation. The sample is assessed under the microscope, where the presence of any mites is considered a positive result.  
"
"It can be difficult to find sarcoptic mites, and sometimes several areas need to be sampled for positive identification. In some cases, no mites are found and treatment is started because of the severity of clinical signs, age, and physical examination. Response to treatment is then monitored closely. 
"
"Some mites can sometimes be found through fecal flotation or fecal testing because the dog ingested them while licking/chewing the skin. 
"
"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can also be performed, but it can bring false negative results and is often not necessary when diagnosis is made through clinical signs and response to therapy. 
"
"Finally, skin biopsy may be necessary in cases where the dog is not responding to therapy or if a diagnosis is not made with other less invasive diagnostic tests. Biopsy is sometimes considered if draining wounds, skin swelling, or papules are noted to rule out other causes of these lesions as well as mites. 
"
"You should isolate your dog from other pets and as many humans as possible when treating scabies to avoid the spread of infection as well as re-infection. Isolation should continue until your pet is found to be free of scabies by your veterinarian. 
"
" It is necessary to address any systemic disease, weakened immune system issues, and secondary skin infections for dogs with scabies. Treatment failure is usually caused by failure to treat secondary infections/illnesses and stopping medical therapy too early.  
"
"All cases of sarcoptic mange require medical therapy. Numerous treatments are available including selamectin (Revolution), ivermectin, milbemycin (Interceptor), moxidectin, imidacloprid/moxidectin (Advantage Multi), lime-sulfur dips, doramectin, amitraz, fipronil (Frontline), fluralaner (Bravecto), afoxolaner (NexGard), and sarolaner (Simparica). If one product is not helping resolve the clinical signs, veterinarians will change to another product, which may help speed resolution. 
"
"It is important to note that ivermectin should never be used in collies, collie-crosses, Shetland Sheepdogs, Australian Shepherds, Old English Sheepdogs, and any other dogs that carry the MDR1 gene (multiple drug resistant 1 gene). These dogs can have severe and even fatal side effects when using ivermectin. Other safer options should be used in these breeds. 
"
"Antibiotics to treat skin infections as well as anti-itch medications are often given to help with relief of itching during treatment with miticidal therapy. An Elizabethan collar (pet cone) may be recommended by your veterinarian if your dog is causing injury to her skin. 
"
"Environmental disinfection is extremely important in cases of scabies. Though this mite can easily die in the environment, it can easily jump back onto a host and start to feed. Dogs diagnosed with or suspected of having scabies should have their collars, harnesses, bedding, crates, toys, and bowls washed in diluted bleach or replaced entirely. When disposing of infected items, discard them a sealed garbage bag away from animals and humans to avoid further infestation. 
"
"Recovery from scabies depends on the severity of the infection. Dogs with minor infestations have a speedier resolution than dogs with severe infestations. In more severe cases, it can take weeks to months for full resolution of itching and for the skin to begin to heal itself.  
"
"Monthly or tri-monthly oral or topical flea/tick/mite preventatives are recommended to decrease the chance of re-infection with sarcoptic mange. Good house cleaning and a clean environment are pertinent in controlling scabies. Mange is less common in well cared for, bathed, nutritionally sound dogs who sleep in frequently cleaned bedding and crates.
"
"Sarcoptic mange is contagious to humans. This type of scabies is not the same as human scabies, however. Extremely itchy bumps may occur within 24 hours and may persist for up to 3 weeks after exposure. Sarcoptic mites are not able to complete their life cycle on human skin, so they will eventually die.
"
"If your dog has sudden onset of severe itching, hair loss, or scaling/crusted lesions, it is very important to get them to a veterinarian for testing to find out if they have sarcoptic mange. It is also important to keep them away from other pets and humans as much as possible until they are appropriately treated, and the environment has been disinfected.
"
"Decreased reflexes
"
"Scoliosis in dogs is typically congenital, originating from vertebral malformations that they’ve had since birth. These malformations become more noticeable at a young age, often between 4 and 10 months old, the period when most growth occurs.
"
"Congenital scoliosis is usually associated with other vertebral malformations, such as hemivertebrae (abnormally shaped vertebrae). This malformation often appears to be wedge-shaped.
"
"Hemivertebrae form when both halves of the vertebral body fail to fuse properly during fetal development. They are more often found in the thoracic vertebrae and can occur either singly or in multiples. This condition is more prevalent in brachycephalic breeds like the French Bulldog, English Bulldog, Pug, and Boston Terrier.
"
"Other (rare) causes of scoliosis in dogs include:
"
"Trauma affecting the vertebrae, ribs, or associated muscles and ligaments.
"
"Inflammatory or immune-mediated diseases, such as immune-mediated meningomyelitis
"
"Secondary degenerative changes of intervertebral discs and intervertebral disc extrusions (herniation) along the vertebral column
"
"Associated condition of spinal cord disease, such as syringomyelia (fluid pockets within the spinal cord), seen in breeds like the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Brussels Griffon suffering from Chiari-like malformation (herniation of the brain tissue into the spinal canal).
"
"A veterinarian can typically diagnose scoliosis through a combination of a physical exam and X-rays.
"
"If your dog has neurologic disease or extreme pain, your veterinarian may recommend blood work and infectious disease testing.
"
"They may also refer your dog to a veterinary neurologist for an MRI or CT scan and a CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) tap, which are conducted under anesthesia. If these tests are not doable, your veterinarian may perform a myelogram, a procedure in which contrast dye is injected into the fluid surrounding your dog’s spinal cord.
"
"Early diagnosis and treatment are considered factors in a successful outcome for a dog.
"
"Mild forms of scoliosis may not require any treatment. However, if your dog is in pain, then your vet might prescribe medications such as gabapentin, anti-inflammatories like an NSAID, methocarbamol (a muscle relaxer), or a combination of these. 
"
"If your dog is showing neurologic symptoms, then your vet may prescribe a course of antibiotics or steroids.
"
"Management of scoliosis in dogs is often associated with a poor prognosis, and surgery is the ideal treatment choice. There have been successful results with spinal stabilization.
"
"For dogs with severe symptoms and/or refractory pain, humane euthanasia may be recommended.
"
"The prognosis for dogs affected by scoliosis varies. Over time, your dog’s pain and symptoms may worsen, necessitating additional follow-ups or testing. Because of this, it’s important to work with your vet to help manage your dog’s condition and ensure the best possible outcome.
"
"Dogs who have undergone surgery usually require several weeks of recuperation with cage rest. During this recovery period, physical therapy may be recommended. Physical therapy may include:
"
"These therapies assist with walking, strength building, preserving muscle, inflammation reduction, and improved mobility.
"
"A dog is contagious with sarcoptic mange until 36 hours after they have started appropriate therapy and the environment has been completely disinfected.

"Salmonella is a type of bacteria that infects the gastrointestinal tract and can cause severe diarrhea in humans. In a dog, salmonella infection (called salmonellosis) is not common and often does not result in symptoms unless the dog has an already weakened immune system or is a puppy.
"
"Most salmonella bacteria are host-specific, meaning that individual strains will cause disease only in certain species of otherwise healthy animals. A cow with illness from salmonella is unlikely to make a healthy dog sick, and vice versa.
"
"However, even if a dog does not show signs of salmonellosis, he can still spread the disease through feces or saliva, which can infect humans. The type of salmonella that affects dogs is more likely to affect humans as well, making it a zoonotic disease.
"
"Although illness from salmonella is normally rare in dogs, the risk grows when pet parents choose raw and unprocessed meats as part of their dog’s diets.
"
"In all species, diarrhea and illness from salmonella is often severe and can lead to dehydration, sepsis, and even death if left untreated. Parents should promptly take their dogs to a veterinarian when diarrhea occurs with decreased appetite, lethargy, fever, and blood in the stool.
"
"Although salmonella can cause disease in multiple systems of the body, symptoms are most often seen when it disrupts the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of salmonellosis include the following:
"
"Adobe Stock/Samara
"
"Dogs can be allergic to various things in the environment, such as pollen from trees and grass. If a dog displays allergy symptoms only during certain seasons, such as spring and fall, a seasonal allergy rather than a year-round allergy is suspected. This means that the dog is allergic to allergens that are in the environment only during certain times of the year.
"
"Dogs with seasonal allergies can be itchy in specific areas, such as their paws, or be itchy all over. They can also have recurring ear infections and skin infections when they are exposed to various environmental allergens at certain times during the year.
"
"Seasonal allergies are different from year-round environmental allergies and food allergies because symptoms are observed only during specific times of the year, depending on what the dog is allergic to and when the specific allergens are prevalent in the environment. In contrast, dogs with year-round allergies will have skin issues all year long.
"
"Most dogs with seasonal allergies have symptoms during the spring (March through May) and fall (September through November), but this can vary based on weather and location. 
"
"The following allergens commonly cause seasonal allergies in dogs:
"
"Grass pollen
"
"Tree pollen
"
"Weed pollen
"
"If your dog is given prescription medications, it’s likely that they will be needed for a long time, if not for life. Do not discontinue these medications unless instructed by your vet. 
"
"Scoliosis is not entirely preventable, but responsible breeding practices and screening of breeding dogs can help reduce the likelihood of passing on the condition to puppies.
"
"If you have a breed of dog that’s predisposed to scoliosis, it’s recommended to have them screened as a puppy, so that treatment measures—if needed—can begin immediately.
"
"If you notice any curvature or deformity in your dog’s spine at any point, it’s important to have your dog evaluated by their vet right away.
"
"Dogs living with scoliosis can have a normal quality of life if there is minimal neurologic impact. Certain conditions caused by scoliosis in dogs can respond to therapy with early diagnosis and treatment.

"
"Vomiting
"
"Lethargy
"
"Fever
"
"Decreased appetite, with or without weight loss
"

"
"Though clinical signs overlap with other causes of severe diarrhea, salmonellosis may be suspected based on diet history, travel history, recent illness, or stress on the immune system.
"
"Though it is rare, salmonella can travel to the lungs, causing pneumonia, or to the reproductive tract of breeding female dogs, leading to loss of pregnancy.
"
"Usually, salmonella is transmitted when a dog swallows fecal matter from infected animals or products contaminated by bacteria. Dogs in agricultural settings are at higher risk, as are dogs whose diets include raw chicken or beef. Dried pig ears are another common source for canine infection.
"
"Salmonellosis is unlikely to occur if a dog accidentally swallows a small amount of raw meat. though other mild types of gastrointestinal upset (such as enteritis) may occur. Mild upset usually does not require medical attention, though the pet parent should watch their dog closely for symptoms.
"
"Good hygiene should always be followed when handling or disposing of pet waste. Raw diets should be avoided, as repeated exposure to salmonella sources increases likelihood of illness for the entire family.
"
"Diagnosing salmonellosis can be difficult because the symptoms overlap with many other types of illness. In addition, dogs often do not show symptoms. Typically, a veterinarian will suspect salmonellosis by the symptoms and a history of exposure through raw meat consumption, or if any humans in the family are experiencing symptoms.
"
"Other causes of severe gastrointestinal inflammation can cause similar symptoms to salmonellosis. These include foreign material ingestion, parasites, Addison’s disease, and viral diseases. These should be ruled out through bloodwork, radiographs, and fecal tests prior to diagnosing salmonella.

Treatment rarely requires a veterinarian to test for the specific type of salmonella unless recurring exposure is suspected and the source of infection has yet to be determined.
"
" 
"
"As with many other causes of gastrointestinal inflammation, treating salmonellosis is mostly supportive care. This includes:
"
"Hydration with fluid therapy
"
"Controlling nausea and vomiting
"
"Preventing blood infection/poisoning with antibiotics
"
"Some patients may need greater care, such as feeding tubes, fever suppression medication, probiotics, or fecal transplants to reinstate normal gut flora.

"Excessive licking, usually of the paws, but the licking can be anywhere on the body
"
"Saliva staining of the fur where the dog is licking the skin excessively

"A dog that suffers from seasonal allergies has an immune system that is hypersensitive to specific allergens in the environment. When the levels of the allergens become high, the dog’s immune system becomes triggered, leading to an allergic response and the development of symptoms.  
"
"Seasonal allergies are diagnosed based on physical exam findings, symptoms, and a history of having recurring symptoms and infections during the same seasons annually.
"
"Other skin conditions that can cause similar symptoms must also be ruled out, such as skin mites, fleas, or a food allergy, to reach a diagnosis of seasonal allergies. If fleas are found on a dog with symptoms of severe itchiness, redness, and hair loss, then a flea allergy is diagnosed and the dog is started on effective flea and tick prevention and anti-itch medication to see if symptoms resolve. 
"
"Seasonal allergies are a chronic condition, which means there is no cure. However, there are ways to treat and manage symptoms to keep your dog comfortable, including:
"
"Recovery depends mostly on the severity of the infection. Mild cases may respond to supportive care within a few days, while dogs with advanced infections and blood poisoning may require multiple weeks of intensive therapy including intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and feeding tubes.
"
"Feeding your dog well-balanced commercial diets and processed treats is the best way to avoid salmonellosis. The documented safety risks of raw food diets include E. coli, salmonella, and even tuberculosis. There have been no studies indicating that these diets are healthier than commercially prepared and cooked diets.
"
"At minimum, meat and eggs should be fully cooked before being offered to pets. Monitor the FDA pet food recall lists for any potentially contaminated products.
"
"Disease from salmonella in dogs is uncommon (though serious if it occurs). More commonly, dogs serve as a host for salmonella bacteria that will cause severe illness in people if transmitted. 
"
"Raw chicken and dried pig ears are two of the most common sources for salmonella bacteria found in the intestines of dogs, especially due to the popular (but inadvisable) trend of feeding raw meat to dogs and cats.
"
"Dogs affected by salmonellosis can become extremely ill. Untreated dogs will often die of dehydration and bacteria entering the bloodstream (sepsis).

"Salmon poisoning disease (SPD) is an often fatal condition, occurring when a dog eats raw salmon that is infected with the Neorickettsia helminthoeca parasite. This disease typically begins in the tissues of the small intestine, where it causes hemorrhaging. It gradually becomes systemic, invading the entire body.
"
"The signs and symptoms of SPD include the following:
"
"Dogs contract the Neorickettsia helminthoeca parasite when they consume raw fish, including raw salmon, trout, and other fish that contain the N. helminthoeca organisms, like the trematode vector.
"
"To diagnose SPD, your veterinarian will need to rule out other conditions that are known to cause similar symptoms, including:
"
"Once these alternate conditions have been ruled out, your doctor will collect fluid from a swollen lymph node to test for Rickettsial bodies. This can be done using the Giemsa stain technique, which stains the DNA of parasites, making them visible under microscope.
"
"Your doctor will also perform an examination of the feces to discover whether the organism Nanophyetus salmincola has laid eggs in the feces, which will also confirm a diagnosis of SPD. Other findings may include changes in the lymph tissue, which may show yellowish tissue in the lymph node, and blood within the intestinal contents.
"
"
"
"Very ill patients will need inpatient treatment. Treatment will involve intravenous fluid therapy to replace lost fluid, antibiotic therapy, and therapy to control diarrhea. Some dogs may also need electrolyte replacement therapy and/or blood transfusions.
"
"Animals will need to be adequately cared for and proper hygiene will need to be maintained to help the animal return to good health. Your veterinarian may recommend that you keep your dog caged for a short time to prevent overexertion while it is recovering. This will also help you monitor your pet’s progress toward recovery.
"
"The most effective way to prevent SPD in a dog is to preclude it from consuming raw fish.

"Year-round flea and tick prevention such as NexGard®, Simparica®, Bravecto®, Seresto® collar, and K9 Advantix™ II
"
"Anti-itch medications such as Apoquel®, Cytopoint®, and prednisone are prescribed to alleviate any current itchiness and to manage the itch during flare-ups. If the itch can be controlled, the dog will remain comfortable and be at less risk for secondary skin infections.
"
"Once the allergy seasons are determined for a dog based on prior history, the anti-itch medication is started one month prior to the start of the allergy season and continued one month past when the allergy season ends.
"
"If the itch is not fully controlled with anti-itch medication, a recovery cone should be worn to prevent the dog from licking and chewing at their body.
"
"An omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil) supplement, such as Welactin®, Vetoquinol, or Dermaquin®, will protect the skin barrier and minimize allergy symptoms.
"
"An omega-3 fatty acid supplement can also help with anal gland issues for dogs that tend to need their anal glands expressed more frequently during allergy season. It takes four to six weeks for an omega-3 fatty acid supplement to become effective, so it is best for a dog with seasonal allergies to be on this supplement year-round.
"
"Routine ear cleaning can help clear a current ear infection and reduce the frequency of future ear infections. If an ear infection is present, treat the infection and clean the ears based on recommendations from your veterinarian. When there is no infection, clean the dog’s ears with a routine ear cleaner, like EpiOtic® Advanced, on a routine basis throughout the year (typically every two to three weeks for maintenance).
"
"Ear medications, such as Mometamax®, Posatex®, and Tresaderm®, are prescribed to treat bacterial and/or yeast infections in a dog’s ears. After treatment, make sure to schedule a follow-up appointment with your veterinarian to recheck that the infection has resolved.
"
"Oral medications are often needed when a dog has a skin infection on multiple areas of the body. Antibiotics, such as clindamycin and cephalexin, are prescribed to treat bacterial skin infections, and anti-fungal medication, such as ketoconazole, is prescribed to treat fungal skin infections, such as yeast infections.
"
"Topical therapy can be used to soothe the skin and help with treatment of skin infections. There are many topical therapy options, including anti-bacterial and anti-fungal ointments, shampoos, conditioners, mousses, sprays, and wipes. Ask your veterinarian which topical therapy would work best based on your dog’s allergy symptoms and current skin condition.
"
"Immunotherapy consists of either allergy shots or allergy oral drops that are formulated based on allergy test results. To determine what environmental allergens a dog is most allergic to based on where the dog lives, a blood test can be performed by your veterinarian using a specific blood test (Heska’s Allercept® or Nextmune’s Pet Allergy Xplorer) to screen a dog for environmental allergies.
"
"In addition to the allergy blood test, a veterinary dermatologist will also perform intradermal testing, which involves injecting small amounts of various environmental allergens into a dog’s skin in specific locations. The injection sites are then monitored over a period of time for signs of a skin reaction. If a reaction is seen, then the dog is likely allergic to the allergen that was injected at that site.
"
"It is important to note that the allergy (blood) testing and the intradermal testing are not performed to provide a diagnosis of seasonal allergies. Rather, they are used to aid in creating immunotherapy treatment for a dog that has been diagnosed with seasonal allergies. The goal with immunotherapy is to desensitize a dog to the environmental allergens that trigger the allergy symptoms. Immunotherapy is usually given long-term at a maintenance dose.
"
"It is difficult to limit a dog’s exposure to certain allergens. Pollen from trees, grass, or weeds can be tracked into the house easily. Wiping a pup’s paws when they come inside can sometimes be helpful. 
"
"Seasonal allergies are not only frustrating for dogs but also for pet parents, because they are not curable. Fortunately, though, with seasonal allergies, symptoms can be managed by knowing what seasons trigger a dog’s symptoms and initiating treatment prior to the start of each allergy season. Anti-itch medication should manage the itch throughout each season so that the dog is not scratching, licking, or chewing at the skin, which can lead to secondary skin infections.
"
"Cleaning your dog’s ears every two to three weeks year-round with a routine ear cleaner is important to minimize the risk of an ear infection to develop. The ears should also be cleaned after your dog has a bath or partakes in a water activity, such as swimming, to remove any water from within the ear canals. Giving an omega-3 fatty acid supplement daily year-round can provide skin support as well. Management of seasonal allergies is usually lifelong unless a dog is able to move to an area where the allergen that is causing the reaction is no longer present.
"
"Monitor your pet for the following symptoms throughout the year:
"
"Itchiness (scratching, licking, gnawing, chewing)
"
"Head shaking or pawing at the ears or eyes
"
"Any skin lesions (such as redness, crusts, thickened or black pigmented skin)
"
"Odor to the skin or ears
"
"If you see any of these symptoms, schedule a vet appointment as soon as possible. Your dog’s skin condition can worsen quickly if allergy symptoms are not controlled. If your dog is licking or chewing, have them wear an e-collar until the appointment to prevent further worsening of the skin. Your veterinarian will prescribe treatment to make your dog more comfortable and treat for any skin or ear infection, if present. Managing a dog’s allergy symptoms with therapy and reporting to your veterinarian any skin issues as they arise are the most effective ways to help a dog with seasonal allergies.

"Keeping our dogs free of heartworms is much cheaper, easier, and safer than treating them for a full-blown disease. However, it is important that you use heartworm preventives properly — both for your safety and your dog's safety.
"
"It’s very important that you use only approved heartworm medications, in the correct dosage, for your dog’s particular age, weight, and health status. But before deciding to give a heartworm medication to your dog, ask your veterinarian for advice. A negative heartworm test is required to obtain a prescription for heartworm medication, so you will need to have your dog tested for heartworms first. Also, your veterinarian will only give you a prescription for a heartworm preventive if the dog is shown to have no heartworms (tested negative).
"
"There are several kinds of heartworm preventive medications commonly used today. Many of these preventives have multiple benefits; some also control intestinal parasites as well as external parasites.
"
"Common active ingredients used in heartworm preventives today include ivermectin and milbemycin. Ivermectin has been used for decades to prevent heartworm disease in dogs. There are rarely side effects, if given at the proper dosage, but some dogs may experience vomiting, diarrhea, or incoordination. In the case of an allergic response to the heartworm medication, a dog may experience itching, hives, swelling of the face, or even seizures or shock.
"
"Certain breeds of dog are at risk of having a reaction to ivermectin and milbemycin. These breeds include Collies, Sheepdogs, Australian Shepherds, and Whippets. This is due to a genetic mutation that causes them to be unable to clear the heartworm medication from their brain, bringing on seizures and even death. Your veterinarian can suggest alternative heartworm preventives for your dog if it is one of the breeds at risk. If you want to be completely sure, you can ask your veterinarian to perform a DNA test to check if your dog has the genetic mutation.
"
"Newer topical or spot-on medications are available to prevent not only heartworms, but also fleas, ticks, mites, and more. Depending on the brand you choose, your dog can be protected from many parasites (internal and external), all in one monthly application. Selamectin and moxidectin work by absorbing into the dog’s skin and collecting in the oil glands under the skin. From there, the drug dispenses slowly over time, protecting the dog.
"
"When applying these types of heartworm medications, you want to be careful not to get it on your skin or in your eyes. The fur in the area between the shoulder blades should be separated, to find the skin below. Apply the liquid directly to the skin instead of to the fur. Wash your hands after handling these medications (or wear disposable gloves so there is no skin contact at all). Label instructions should always be followed carefully. Keep your dog indoors and watch him for about 30 minutes following application. Children and other animals should be kept apart while the heartworm medication is absorbing.
"
"Adverse reactions to these preventives are rare, but do occur. Possible side effects may include vomiting, diarrhea, drooling, panting, and trembling. Some dogs can have an allergic reaction to these types of medications, similar to the reactions seen with ivermectin. Hair loss at the application site has also been reported.
"
"[video]
"
" 
"
"Another product that was first approved for use in 2001 in dogs is an injectable moxidectin product that works for six months as a heartworm preventive. It also kills hookworms with just one injection. This product was voluntarily recalled in 2004 and then re-introduced in 2008 under a risk management program in agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Veterinarians that offer this product must be registered with the manufacturer and be trained in its use before being able to purchase the product.
"
"Only a veterinarian is allowed to inject this product, and only after you are given information about its risks and side effects. You must sign a consent form and veterinarians are required to keep records of each product’s lot number in case any side effects are reported. Adverse effects for this product can include facial swelling, itching, vomiting, diarrhea, seizure, or shock.
"
"Here are just a few more basic tips to consider when giving your dog heartworm preventives:

"Dogs have four pairs of salivary glands located within the jaw or neck region. These glands create saliva that is excreted into your dog’s mouth. Similar to other types of glands, cancer can form in the salivary glands. The most common type of salivary gland cancer in dogs is adenocarcinoma. This is an aggressive and malignant type of cancer that needs to be diagnosed and treated by a veterinarian. 
"
"Dogs have four pairs of salivary glands that are located below the eye (zygomatic), behind the jawbone where the neck meets the jaw (mandibular), under the tongue (sublingual), and around the base of the ear (parotid). The gland most affected by adenocarcinoma is the parotid gland.  
"
"There are also multiple accessory salivary glands located throughout the mouth in the lips, cheeks, and palate. Salivary gland adenocarcinoma occurs when cells that line the salivary glands grow out of control and create a tumor.  
"
" 
"
"Dogs with adenocarcinoma can develop symptoms, depending on the size and location of a tumor. Symptoms may include: 
"
"Bad breath   
"
"Drooling 
"
"Difficulty swallowing  
"
"Changes in your dog’s voice (barking) 
"
"Firm, painless swelling near a salivary gland  
"
"One eye bulging out  
"
"Swelling of the lips, cheeks, near the ear/upper neck, or under the tongue   
"
"We don’t know what causes salivary gland adenocarcinoma. Although many cancers can result from environmental and/or genetic factors, there are no known genetic or environmental causes of salivary gland adenocarcinomas. 
"
"If your vet suspects a salivary gland adenocarcinoma, they will perform an examination. This may include reviewing the dog’s health record and discussing any symptoms you’ve noticed, including difficulty swallowing or eating, bad breath, or other symptoms.  
"
"You veterinarian may perform a fine needle biopsy to collect cells from the tumor to examine under a microscope. During this procedure, your vet will use a very fine needle to collect a small sample of cells from the tumor. These cells will be examined under a microscope to determine if they are cancerous versus caused by an infection or inflammation.  
"
"If abnormal cells are present, your vet may recommend x-rays of the skull and neck to look for changes in the bone near the affected salivary gland. 
"
"During a surgical biopsy, your veterinarian will remove either all or part of the tumor in a surgical procedure. This removed tissue will be sent to a medical specialist called a pathologist to examine the tissue and make a diagnosis. 
"
"The primary treatment of salivary gland adenocarcinoma is surgery to remove the tumor. However, before surgery your vet may also perform tests to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the dog’s body.  
"
"The process of cancer spreading is called metastasizing. Cancers are “staged” depending on how far they have spread. The most common site for adenocarcinomas to spread to are nearby lymph nodes, but they may also spread to your dog’s lungs. Cancers that have metastasized may be treated differently than cancers that are confined to the original gland.  
"
"Once your vet has determined the cancer’s stage, they may recommend further testing to help develop a treatment plan. Additional tests can include:  
"
"Complete blood chemistry 
"
"Urinalysis 
"
"X-rays of the lungs, and/or an ultrasound of the abdomen  
"
"Because salivary gland adenocarcinoma is often aggressive, your vet may also suggest a CT scan or MRI to examine the area around the gland. 
"
"Adenocarcinoma is often very aggressive and can spread to nearby parts of the face, including large blood vessels and nerves, or the lungs. In these instances, your vet may not be able to completely remove the tumor and may recommend radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is also used to treat tumors that cannot be removed with surgery because of their location.  
"
"If tests indicate the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, your veterinarian may prescribe chemotherapy. 
"
"Recovery from surgery requires your dog to rest comfortably at home. Your veterinarian may also prescribe medicine to ease pain and reduce inflammation, along with antibiotics to prevent infection. Your dog will also require follow-up visits to your veterinarian and possibly radiation therapy, depending on your vet’s diagnosis.  
"
"The combination of surgery and radiation therapy typically increases a dog’s life-span. However, if a tumor is not completely removed or radiation therapy is not successful, the tumor will regrow at the original location. Without any treatment, the average survival time in dogs diagnosed with adenocarcinoma is approximately 1.5 years. 
"
"Salivary gland adenocarcinomas can be very aggressive and often spread to surrounding parts of the body. Due to the location of the salivary glands, some major nerves and blood vessels can be affected by a tumor, which makes complete surgical removal difficult. 
"
"Due to the location of the salivary glands, adenocarcinomas are usually not directly visible. However, some owners might see firm, non-painful swelling at one ear base, in the upper neck near the jaw line, or bulging of one eye.

"While the term “ringworm” may conjure up the image of a long, wriggly intestinal parasite, this is inaccurate, as ringworm is not actually a worm at all. Ringworm is a name that has long been used because of the circular itchy rash that typically appears on the skin of an infected animal. Ringworm is a fungal infection that can affect the skin, hair, or nails. The medical term for this type of infection is called dermatophytosis. The most common fungal organisms that can cause ringworm are Microsporum and Trichophyton. The fungus feeds on dead hair or skin cells.  
"
"While ringworm is most commonly found in cats, it can also be contracted by dogs and humans. It is highly contagious and zoonotic, meaning it can spread from pets to people and vice versa. 
"
"When the stomach is interrupted in its normal operation, a condition called stasis can result. Stasis is when the stomach slows its contractions, and may even stop working altogether. This leads to bloating and build-up of gas in the stomach, which can be an uncomfortable condition for an animal. Interruptions in the working of the stomach of a dog can be brought on by several conditions.
"
"The main symptoms of stasis in dogs are:
"
"When movement (motility) of the stomach slows or stops, there are many things to consider as possible causes. Problems with the stomach itself and its ability to contract are rare causes of stasis, but do occur. These types of problems are uncommon in young animals.
"
" 
"
"The signs and symptoms of stasis are usually the result of an underlying problem that causes the stomach to stop working. Such problems may include:
"
"Your veterinarian will perform routine tests to rule out any potential cause of vomiting. Basic tests include a physical exam, complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry profile, urinalysis, fecal examination and X-rays. If necessary, a special imaging technique called a contrast study may be used. This study will involve giving the dog an oral dose of liquid material (barium) that shows up on X-rays. Films are taken at various stages to examine the passage of the barium through the body.
"
"Specialized tests may be necessary if routine and less invasive examinations do not point to the problem. In some cases, a flexible scope with a camera (endoscope) may be used to examine the stomach and intestine. This test requires that the animal be placed under anesthesia. Small samples of tissue (biopsy) may be taken for testing through the use of the scope. These samples will help rule out serious conditions in the stomach such as cancer.
"
"
"
"The majority of patients can be treated with dietary changes at home. Low-fat and low-fiber foods in a semi-liquid or liquid consistency are usually prescribed. Feedings should be given in frequent, small amounts. In many cases of stomach motility disorders, dietary changes alone will manage the problem. In cases that include serious vomiting and dehydration, dogs must be hospitalized and treated with fluids and electrolytes given intravenously (IV). Depending on the underlying disease process, surgery may be indicated to correct the problem (e.g., GDV or cancer).
"
"Drug therapy can help increase muscle contractions and allow movement of materials out of the stomach in animals with long-term problems. The two main drugs used in the treatment of stasis are metoclopramide and cisapride. Metoclopramide is an oral medication with anti-vomiting properties which is given 30 to 45 minutes prior to feeding. Reversible side effects can occur with this medication and include behavior changes, depression, or hyperactivity.
"
"Cisapride is an oral medication also given about 30 minutes prior to meals. It stimulates motility and is shown to be more effective than metoclopramide. Cisapride does not cause the same nervous system side effects; however, it may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and depression. This medication has been limited due to side effects in humans, but can be obtained by veterinarians through a special pharmacy that will compound the drug.
"
"Other medications that may be used to promote gastric emptying and stimulate motility in dogs include erythromycin, clarithromycin, domperidone, rantidine, and nizatidine.
"
"Dogs that do not have an underlying condition causing stasis of the stomach will generally respond well to dietary and drug therapy. Those that do not respond to therapy should be examined more extensively for possible obstruction. In some cases, an affected dog will need to continue medication and diet changes on a long-term basis.

"A retained or persistent deciduous (baby) tooth is one that is still present despite the eruption of the permanent tooth (between three to seven months of age). This can cause the permanent teeth to erupt in abnormal positions, resulting in an incorrect bite pattern (or how the upper and lower teeth fit together when biting or chewing). Retained deciduous teeth may also cause overcrowding of teeth, accidental bites into the palate, or an abnormal jaw position.
"
"As with most oral issues, early recognition and immediate dental care is essential to prevent permanent damage. Unfortunately, it often goes undiagnosed until later in life.
"
"Retained deciduous teeth are more common in dogs, though it does occur in cats. It often affects smaller breeds of dog, including the Maltese, Poodles, Yorkshire Terriers, and Pomeranian.
"
"In addition to observing the deciduous (baby) teeth once the permanent teeth begin to erupt, the following signs may occur:
"
"None identified.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam and inspect your dog's mouth.  He or she will chart the teeth present in the mouth to and record the presence of deciduous teeth. X-rays of the inside of the mouth will also be taken to verify which teeth are permanent and which are deciduous, and whether baby teeth have permanent successors ready to replace them.
"
"
"
"The deciduous (baby) tooth should be surgically removed as soon as the permanent tooth has begun pushing through your dog’s gums. In addition, fractured or retained root(s) may need to be removed with a gingival flap -- a procedure in which the gums are separated from the teeth and folded back to allow a veterinarian to reach the root of the tooth and the bone.
"
"After surgery, restrict your dog’s activity for the rest of the day. Feed him or her a soft diet—canned or moistened dry kibble—as well as restrict its access to chew toys for 24 hours after surgery.
"
"Your veterinarian will provide you with oral pain medication to give to your pet for one to three days after surgery. You may also be asked to administer an oral rinse or gel in your pet's mouth for three to five days after surgery. Daily brushing, meanwhile, should commence 24 hours after brushing.

"A retained placenta, or retained afterbirth, occurs when the placenta (the sac surrounding an unborn puppy) is not passed out of the mother’s uterus along with the puppy.
"
"The placenta is retained in the uterus rather than being expelled with or shortly after the birth of the puppy.
"
"History of a recent birth with a physical examination finding of a green discharge from the vulva is supportive of a diagnosis of retained placenta. Your veterinarian may recommend routine blood testing, though these results may be normal. Vaginal cytology may also be recommended. Your veterinarian may need to take X-rays and/or perform an ultrasound of the uterus. In some cases, exploratory surgery may be necessary.
"
" 
"
"Oxytocin may be administered in an attempt to pass the retained placenta and calcium gluconate may be administered prior to the injection of oxytocin. If medical treatment with oxytocin is unsuccessful, surgery to remove the retained placenta from the uterus may be necessary. Ovariohysterectomy (spay) may be recommended if your dog is not to be bred again.
"
"Acute metritis (inflammation of the uterus) may develop if the placenta is not passed/removed and may need to be treated as well.

"Red gums in dogs are usually a sign of a dental problem. A dog with good oral health has healthy pink gums, clean white teeth, and no signs of tartar buildup. No teeth should be loose.
"
"When a dog’s gums begin to turn red, it could mean the beginning of gingivitis or periodontal disease. Red gums in dogs can also be caused by injury, ingesting something toxic, or overheating. In rare cases, the cause may be oral cancer.

"In dogs, the areas usually affected by ringworm are the face, ears, tail, and feet. Symptoms generally include one or more of the following: 
"
"Circular areas of hair loss, often with a red and crusty edge 
"
"Broken hair and a poor hair coat 
"
"Dry, scaly skin or areas of excessive dandruff 
"
"Inflamed areas of skin 
"
"Darkened patches of skin 
"
"Itchiness, scratching, or excessive grooming 
"
"Inflamed nail beds or darkened or dry nails 
"
"Dry, brittle, or misshapen nails
"
"Most dogs with ringworm contract it from direct contact with an infected animal (likely a dog or cat) or human. It is possible for dogs to have the ringworm fungus on their body but show no external signs of the disease; however, they can still pass the disease on to humans or other animals.  
"
"Ringworm can also be passed on through contaminated objects such as brushes, dog beds, and toys, as well as surfaces that are difficult to clean, like rugs, wool, and wood. 
"
"Some types of ringworm fungi live in the soil, and a dog could contract ringworm by digging around in the dirt. This is especially true in warm and humid environments. The spores of the fungi that cause ringworm are quite hardy and can live in the environment for at least 18 months. 
"
"The types of dogs that become infected with ringworm tend to be those with weaker immune systems, such as very young or old dogs, as well as dogs with diseases that weaken their immune systems, or dogs that have recently come from long term stays at kennels or shelters. Boston Terriers, Yorkshire Terriers, and Russell Terriers are genetically more prone to ringworm infections than other breeds. 
"
"Dogs that have skin conditions are also predisposed to ringworm. The skin usually functions as a health protective barrier, but if a pet has an open wound, fresh scratches, fleas, or a chronic skin condition they are more susceptible to an infection.  
"
"Infection with ringworm occurs when spores attach to damaged skin. Lesions (abnormal areas) on the skin will typically appear about 1-3 weeks after exposure.  
"
"There are a few procedures that your vet may use when diagnosing ringworm, the most common of which are a Wood’s lamp examination, a fungal culture, and a PCR test. 
"
"A Wood’s lamp emits long-wave ultraviolet light (a type of “black light”) to help detect bacteria. The fungus Microsporum canis (the most common cause of ringworm infections in pets) causes a chemical reaction when it attaches to hair follicles, causing them to glow when a Wood’s lamp shines. No fluorescence will be seen on a pet that is an asymptomatic carrier.  
"
"This “bedside” examination is effective in about 72% of M. canis cases with active skin lesions. Fluorescence usually becomes visible about 5-18 days after an infection takes hold. It is a great place to start when a vet is suspicious a dog may have ringworm.   
"
"A fungal culture (sometimes called a DTM—dermatophyte test medium) is where a few hairs, scales, or scabs are collected and placed on a culture medium (a substance for growing microorganisms) and the contaminant is allowed to grow.  
"
"Your vet will then look at the growth under a microscope to determine if one of the fungal species that cause ringworm is present. Positive signs can show after 3-5 days, but final results can take 10-21 days. One benefit of this test is that it does not require an active skin lesion; any hair sample can be tested. 
"
"Tartar buildup and bad breath: signs of gingivitis or periodontal disease
"
"Bleeding from the gums: sign of gingivitis, injury (such as from biting on a sharp object), or eating something toxic
"
"Panting: sign of overheating
"
"Cobbled texture: sign of warts or cancer
"
"Possible conditions that can cause red gums in dogs include:
"
"Gingivitis and periodontal disease: With this mild type of gum disease, bacteria build up at the base of the teeth, forming tartar and plaque. This inflames the gums, but damage has not yet occurred to the tooth bone or ligaments holding the teeth in place. When gingivitis worsens, the gums become damaged.
"
"Crowding teeth: If a young dog has too many teeth for the size of their mouth, their gums may become impacted and red.
"
"Advanced age: With some dogs, their gums tend to turn red or even swell as they grow older.
"
"Injury or trauma: Gums can swell and turn red when damaged by biting or being pierced by a hard, sharp object. This may be caused by poor chewing habits.
"
"Toxicity: Your dog’s gums may turn cherry red if they consume something poisonous, such as eating a toxic plant or licking a poisonous toad.
"
"Overheating and heatstroke: A dog’s gums may turn red if your pet is overheated or experiencing heatstroke. In this case, your dog may also be panting heavily.
"
"Disease: Cancer, diabetes mellitus, or uremia (seen with kidney injury or urinary tract obstruction) can cause a dog’s gums to swell and turn red, and you’ll usually also notice other symptoms with each of these.
"
"To determine why your dog’s gums have turned red, your veterinarian will examine their teeth and gums and do a complete physical exam. They may also perform the following tests:
"
"Dental x-rays of the teeth and gums, which can determine if the cause is gingivitis, periodontal disease, or trauma. The exam may be done under anesthesia.
"
"Blood and urine tests to check for an underlying medical condition
"
"Tissue biopsy when conditions such as papillomavirus are suspected
"
"Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams to investigate more serious causes, like cancer
"
"Treatment for red gums in a dog depends on the underlying condition diagnosed by your veterinarian.
"
"Your vet will treat dental problems like gingivitis by deep-cleaning your dog’s teeth to remove plaque and tartar. It’s important to maintain good dental hygiene with your dog all year long.
"
"For more serious dental issues, periodontal surgery or tooth extraction may be recommended. Removing a tooth or teeth may be done to correct an overcrowded mouth.
"
"Red gums from oral lesions (like warts) may disappear on their own, but oral tumors may require surgery to remove.
"
"When red gums are due to a medical condition like diabetes, treatment will be based on addressing the specific condition.
"
"PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing is the newest way to diagnose ringworm. This test is also done on hairs and is specifically looking for fungal DNA (material with the fungus’s genetic information). The PCR test is much faster than a culture, and results are usually available in 3-5 days.  
"
"PCR is a great test for an initial diagnosis of ringworm; however, it is not suitable for follow-up testing to ensure that the ringworm has been fully cleared. This is because PCR testing looks for DNA but cannot distinguish whether the DNA is from living fungus. Fungal culture testing is usually the recommended follow-up test to make sure the infection is completely gone. 
"
"Ringworm is treatable and curable—if all treatment, quarantine, and cleaning procedures are followed. Ringworm can be very stubborn, so it is important to be fully committed to the following procedures: 
"
"Ringworm is highly contagious, so the first thing to do when a ringworm infection is suspected is quarantine your dog. Try to keep your dog away from other pets and limit their contact with humans.  
"
"Ideally, have your dog in a room that can be easily cleaned like a large bathroom. A room with rugs or wood floors should not be used, as these are very difficult to clean. 
"
"Bathing is a critical part of treatment as it will remove and kill the fungal spores that are on your dog’s fur. This is helpful in preventing further environmental contamination and cross-contamination with other animals in the home since hairs that have been treated will not be infectious when shed.  
"
"There are two main types of topical treatments: Lime Sulfur dips and antifungal shampoos. Of these, Lime Sulfur dips are more effective. Lime Sulfur dips can be done at home or at your vet hospital. They are quite messy and odorous, so many pet owners elect to have this done at their vet's office.  
"
"Antifungal shampoos are often paired with a disinfectant like chlorhexidine, as they work well together to combat ringworm. These typically need to be used twice weekly.  
"
"Ointments or other topically applied medications have not been shown to be effective against ringworm infections. 
"
"Shaving dogs with very long coats is not recommended, because shaving can cause microtrauma (small injuries) to the skin, which can make the dog more susceptible to the infection.  
"
"Oral medications clear the ringworm infection by making the fungus unable to reproduce and spread. In most cases it is recommended to use oral and topical measures together.  
"
"There are numerous different types of oral antifungals, with different costs and potential side effects (the most common are gastrointestinal/tummy related).  
"
"Your vet will work with you to find the right product and medication for your pet based on their health and diagnosis.  
"
"Infected pets are constantly shedding fungal spores into the environment. It is extremely important to isolate your dog and to disinfect all other areas of the house until a culture test is negative or your vet recommends stopping treatment. Otherwise, your dog could become reinfected with ringworm from the environment.  
"
"Thoroughly clean all areas that your dog has come into contact with, using an effective disinfectant such as a dilute (1:10) bleach solution, accelerated hydrogen peroxide, or a similar product. Bleach will not properly disinfect a dirty surface, so it is important to clean first, with an agent like liquid dish soap, and to disinfect second.  
"
"You will also want to vacuum and/or steam clean your floors—and don’t forget to disinfect your vacuum afterwards. Items like dog beds that can be laundered should be run through a washing machine, twice, in hot water, preferably with bleach.  
"
"The area of your home in which your pet is confined should be cleaned twice weekly during treatment. When you are treating a pet at home, do your best to wear disposable gloves and be sure to wash your hands and clothing after handling an infected pet. 
"
"It is important to note that pets can be silent carriers of ringworm. A carrier is a pet that is infected but not showing any signs. Because of this, once a pet has been diagnosed with ringworm, all other pets in the home should be tested.  
"
"Treatment generally continues for weeks to months and should not be stopped until follow-up testing shows that the fungal organisms are clear, and your vet directs instructions to stop. Ideally, to monitor the progression of the treatment, a fungal culture should be done every 2-3 weeks after starting treatment.  
"
"A person who is infected with ringworm can also give it to their pets. If you notice a red, ringed skin lesion on your skin, it is best to have your doctor, or a medical professional examine the area.  
"
"When taking in stray dogs or cats, it is important to keep them isolated from your pets until they have had a complete medical evaluation by a veterinarian.  
"
"Since ringworm can be present in soil, don’t let your dog dig outside, especially if there is abundant wildlife living nearby, as they can be a source of infection. 
"
"Taking your dog to the vet for twice yearly exams is also helpful. Pets that have healthy skin are much less susceptible to ringworm.
"
"Unfortunately, ringworm can be highly contagious to humans. Those at highest risk are people with weaker immune systems such as young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those on chemotherapy or other immunosuppressant medications.
"
"The technical answer is that it would most likely go away on its own after about 9-12 months, depending on the species of ringworm fungus and the strength of the dog’s immune system. However, during this time the dog is infecting the environment, and potentially all the humans and other pets in the household could become infected. Most of your dog’s hair would fall out, since ringworm feeds on the hairs and dead skin, leaving your dog's skin more susceptible to wounds and potential secondary infections.

"Red, pale/white, blue, or yellow.
"
"Red gums may indicate gum disease, injury, or many other conditions.
"
"Pale white gums can indicate anemia.
"
"Bluish gums may be due to a lack of oxygen.
"
"Yellowish gums may be due to liver disease or bacterial infection. 
"
"Healthy gums should be pink.
"
"You should not treat this at home. There can be many different causes for red gums in dogs, and only a vet can determine the underlying cause. The vet will determine the appropriate treatment after examining your dog. If dental problems are the cause, dental treatments and better hygiene may be recommended.

"Any type of skin disease can look like ringworm. If you notice your dog has a crusty lesion or circular area of hair loss with a ring of red skin, or any persistent skin damage that is not resolving, they should be examined by a veterinarian to evaluate them for treatment.
"
"There are many old wives’ tales about using household products to treat ringworm, but these are not effective and can be toxic to pets. There are some over-the-counter antifungal shampoos which can be helpful, but nonprescription medications are not always effective.

"Rectal prolapse in dogs is a condition in which rectal tissue protrudes through the anus. It’s usually caused when your dog repeatedly strains while pooping or peeing. There are two types of prolapse: 
"
"Partial Prolapse: Only a small portion of the anal and/or rectal tissue is visible as it protrudes through the anus. This small portion may only be visible while your dog is straining, then spontaneously returns to its normal position inside the rectum.
"
"Complete Prolapse: All the anal tissue and some of the rectal tissue and lining protrude from the anus, even when your dog is not straining. This tissue does not return spontaneously to its normal position.
"
"Prolapsed tissue will often appear bright red in color, and it may look like a swollen tube because it’s filled with fluid. If prolapse is not treated, over time it may develop into a complete prolapse, and the tissue may dry out and turn a dark color—usually blue or black. This means the blood supply to the tissue is obstructed and the tissue itself may be dying. 
 
"
"Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) is a tick-borne (spread by ticks and tick bites) disease caused by an infectious bacteria called Rickettsia rickettsii. Rickettsia is a specialized type of bacteria that can only live inside other cells. Once the bacterium enters the bloodstream, it quickly enters and infects the cells lining the blood vessels (endothelial cells), causing inflammation (swelling) of those vessels and the organs they supply. RMSF can affect many species, but it most commonly affects dogs and humans.  
"
"RMSF was first discovered in 1896 in Snake River Valley, Idaho. It reportedly got its name from the trademark rash in humans, which consists of small red spots and blotches that begin on the wrists and ankles and spread up the arms and legs. It is sometimes referred to in humans as “black measles” because in the late stages of the disease, the skin turns black around the rash.  
"
"Geographically, RMSF has been reported in North, South, and Central America. Within the United States, RMSF has been diagnosed in every state except Vermont and Alaska, but it is most common in North Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri. RMSF is the most common rickettsial disease in dogs in the United States. Correlating with tick season, RMSF is most often diagnosed from April to October. 
"
"Dogs with rectal prolapse typically hunch over while straining to poop or pee. While they’re straining, you may see a tube-shaped mass of tissue protruding through the anal opening.  
"
"In a partial anal prolapse, the exposed tissue may go back to its normal position after your dog stops straining. In a complete anal prolapse, tissue will usually not go back to its normal position without medical or surgical intervention.  
"
"The most common causes of rectal and anal prolapse in dogs include: 
"
"Straining to poop because of severe diarrhea 
"
"Chronic constipation 
"
"Parasites
"
"Inflammation of the intestinal tract
"
"Other causes may include: 
"
"Straining to pee because of a urethral obstruction (the urethra is the tube that carries urine) or enlarged prostate gland 
"
"Obstruction of the bowel because of something unusual your dog ate or the presence of a foreign object
"
"Straining in pregnant females with dystocia (difficult birth) 
"
"Birth defects in your dog’s anatomy
"
"Rectal polyps (clumps of cells)
"
"Tumors in the rectum or anus
"
"A complete physical examination, including manually feeling the rectum, is key to diagnosing rectal or anal prolapse in dogs.  
"
"In a severe complete prolapse, tissue may be visibly protruding through the anus in an elongated tube. These tissues may be swollen or discolored depending on the length of time of exposure. 
"
"X-rays and/or ultrasound of your dog’s abdomen are both important diagnostic tools. These tools allow your vet to identify the following: 
"
"Clinical signs for RMSF are typically vague and non-specific and usually appear 2 to 14 days after the tick bite occurs. Some common symptoms include:
"
"Fever (up to 105 F) 
"
"Lethargy 
"
"Anorexia/weight loss
"
"Painful muscles or joints/swollen joints/lameness
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes
"
"Peripheral edema (swollen legs) 
"
"Red spots (petechiae) or bruising (ecchymosis) on the skin or mucous membranes
"
"Coughing 
"
"Vomiting/diarrhea 
"
"RMSF is often spread through tick bites, most commonly the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni), the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), and the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus).   
"
"Dogs cannot transmit RMSF to each other or to humans. However, transmission can occur through a tick bite (typically requiring 5 to 20 hours of attachment), ingestion of (eating) an infected tick, or direct contamination of a wound by tick feces.
"
"Prompt removal of ticks is very important to prevent RMSF, and humans should wear gloves—not only sanitation—but also for protection if they have a cut on the hand. Failure to wear gloves can result in becoming infected by tick feces or blood/fluids during the removal process.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to conduct a physical exam on your dog to determine if there is a fever, joint swelling, or enlarged lymph nodes. If you’ve recently traveled or had any recent tick exposure, it’s important to disclose that information.
"
"A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will all likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation.  
"
"If your vet is suspicious of RMSF, or other tick-borne illness, he or she may recommend specialized laboratory testing. This many include antibody titers, which tests for an immune response (antibodies) to the presence of the bacteria Rickettsia rickettsii. Another option is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for the presence of the bacteria Rickettsia rickettsii, which may be performed as a part of a tick PCR panel for multiple tick-borne diseases.
"
"Early antibiotic treatment is crucial for successful RMSF management. Your veterinarian will likely start antibiotics immediately before confirmatory tests are available, as any delay in treatment can worsen the disease and prognosis.
"
"Obstruction or a mass in the bowel
"
"Kidney or urethral stones 
"
"Thickening of the bladder wall 
"
"Enlargement of the prostate in male dogs 
"
"Retained fetuses in female dogs that have recently given birth
"
"A fecal examination should be completed to check for parasites. Bloodwork is often valuable in identifying an elevation in your dog’s white blood cell count, which can signal inflammation or widespread infection.
"
"The main goal of treatment is to restore the protruding rectal and anal tissue to its normal position. This will reduce damage or the risk of tissue death.  
"
"General anesthesia is often required to replace the prolapsed tissue. After your dog is under anesthesia, the vet will gently massage the exposed tissue with lubricant gels or a topical application of 50% dextrose solution to shrink swelling. This will help reduce the prolapsed tissue back to its normal anatomic position through the anus.
"
"Once the prolapse has been reduced and is back in place, a purse-string suture should be placed around the anal opening for 5-7 days to prevent a recurrence of the prolapse. A purse-string suture is a special type of stitch that will help preserve the anal opening and reduce the risk of the prolapse recurring.  
"
"In cases of severe prolapse, dead or dying rectal tissue may need to be surgically removed. Your vet will use resection (cutting out the tissue) and anastomosis (reconnecting the ends of the rectum where the dead tissue was cut away). 
"
"This surgery is designed to remove dead tissue, reduce the risk of further damage to the tissue, and reduce the risk of a serious inflammatory reaction called sepsis.
"
"Some underlying causes of rectal prolapse in dogs will also need to be addressed at the same time as the prolapse:
"
"Bowel obstruction: If the prolapse has occurred because of a foreign body obstruction in the bowel, it should be addressed at the same time as the prolapse. This will avoid additional tissue damage to other sections of the bowel.
"
"Urethral obstruction: Urethral obstructions should also be addressed while your dog is anesthetized, to avoid continued straining and prevent damage or rupture to the urinary bladder and urethra.
"
"Dystocia (difficult birth): Pregnant females with a puppy they cannot push out will also require surgical intervention to safely remove the puppy via cesarean section. Prolonged straining with dystocia (difficult birth) can lead to maternal exhaustion, potential rupture of the uterus, and possible death of the puppy.
"
"Depending on disease severity, your dog may need to be hospitalized for IV fluids to correct dehydration as well as to initiate supportive care such as appetite stimulants or pain medications. Antibiotics kill the bacteria that causes RMSF. The vet will determine the best antibiotic for your pet, but Doxycycline is frequently used.   
"
"RMSF can be deadly in dogs if treatment is delayed, with an estimated 1-10% of infected dogs having a fatal infection. However, most dogs will recover and do well with early antibiotic therapy and supportive care.
"
"Some dogs may be managed on an outpatient basis, but many will require hospitalization that typically includes two to three days of IV fluids, supportive care, and antibiotics. They can usually be discharged once their fever breaks and they are consistently eating and drinking on their own.
"
"RMSF cannot be spread from dog to dog, but if multiple pets were exposed to the same area of ticks, please consult with your veterinarian about testing and/or treating all dogs in your household.
"
"Additionally, while RMSF is not zoonotic, meaning you cannot get it from your dog, humans can get RMSF from a tick bite or from tick feces/bodily fluids when removing a tick. If you think you have been exposed to RMSF, please seek medical attention immediately.  
"
"Since the primary route of infection is from ticks, monthly flea and tick prevention is highly recommended. There are topical and oral flea/tick prevention options available, so discuss the best option for your pet with your veterinarian. It is also ideal to keep your pets out of thick brush or wooded areas where ticks commonly live. There is no vaccine for RMSF, so protection against ticks is the best prevention.  
"
"Remember to inspect your dog for ticks after any outdoor time—especially April through October— when ticks are more prevalent. Early removal of ticks helps decrease the likelihood of transmitting the disease. Wear latex gloves when removing ticks and be sure to get the entire head/mouthparts. You can use tick removal tools to aid in this process or ask your veterinarian or a technician for help to remove ticks.
"
"Unlike humans, who get a classic rash, dogs can have symptoms of fever, lethargy, anorexia, joint swelling/pain, and enlarged lymph nodes.
"
"Yes. With early antibiotic therapy, RMSF can be cured, and dogs will often have immunity after successful treatment.
"
"Most dogs will begin to improve within 24 to 48 hours after starting antibiotic therapy. Severe cases may need to be hospitalized for supportive care including IV fluids, appetite stimulants, and pain medications in addition to the antibiotics.
"
"RMSF can be fatal, if left untreated. However, prognosis is generally good with early antibiotic therapy.  
"
"While RMSF is the most common rickettsial disease in dogs and humans in the United States, it is still considered relatively rare.

"Enlarged prostate: Intact (not neutered) male dogs who suffer from rectal prolapse should be evaluated for an enlarged prostate, which can cause straining as the prostate partially obstructs the flow of urine through the urethra.
"
"After the prolapse has been resolved, additional treatment should address the underlying cause(s) of the prolapse.  
"
"If your dog is intact and suffers from an enlarged prostate, they may benefit from castration (neutering), which will result in a gradual decline in male hormone levels, leading to a decrease in the size of the prostate gland.
"
"If a fecal examination is positive for parasites, your dog should be dewormed and placed on a monthly oral or topical heartworm and intestinal parasite prevention to reduce the likelihood of reinfection.  
"
"Stool softeners and a low-residue diet may also be recommended in the post-surgical period so your dog can pass bowel movements more easily.  
"
"In cases of recurrent rectal prolapse, long-term management of the condition may require that your dog undergoes a colopexy. This is a type of surgery in which the vet attaches your dog’s colon to the left side of the abdominal wall so it cannot come out of the anus.  
 
"
"Rectal prolapse in dogs occurs when part of the rectal or anal tissue protrudes from the anal opening. A partial prolapse may look like a doughnut-shaped ring of prolapsed tissue, while a complete prolapse will be look like a solid, tubular structure protruding from your dog’s anus. 
"
"Depending on the severity of the prolapse and how long it’s been prolapsed, the rectal tissue may be swollen with fluid (e.g., edematous) and red, or it may turn blue/black as the tissue begins to die.
"
"Mild, incomplete prolapse of anal tissue may resolve itself after the underlying cause for straining has stopped. A complete prolapse of rectal and anal tissue will usually require medical and/or surgical intervention.
"
"Treatment of a rectal prolapse typically involves anesthetizing your dog to manually replace the prolapsed tissue through the anus and restore it to its normal position within the pelvis.
"
"The exposed tissue must be cleaned and handled gently, lubricant gel or a rinse of 50% dextrose solution is often required to shrink the tissue and replace the prolapse.
"
"After the prolapse has been replaced, a purse-string suture is placed around the anal opening. The placement of the suture will allow poop to pass during a bowel movement but prevent rectal tissue from being pushed out again.
 
"
"Rectal prolapse is the protrusion (pushing out) of the rectal and anal lining and tissues through the anus.  
"
"Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anal area. Dogs do not suffer from hemorrhoids because their gastrointestinal system is situated horizontally in the abdomen. 
"
"As a result, they do not have the added downward pressure of body and organ weight pushing on the blood vessels of the rectum and anus, which is often a contributing factor to developing hemorrhoids

"A rash (pyoderma) is usually a temporary outbreak of scaly, patchy, and sometimes swollen or bumpy skin that is often red and may be itchy.
"
"A rash can occur on any part of your dog’s body, but it pops up most often on the belly. A rash by itself is usually minor and often goes away on its own, but it can be a sign of a more serious situation. The cause of rashes on a dog can range from parasites to diabetes.
"
"Here’s what you should know about rashes on dogs, from what to look for to possible causes and their treatments.
"
"If your dog’s rash gets worse or does not go away after a week, take your dog to the vet to be examined.
"
"With rashes on dogs, you may see:
"
"Red, bumpy skin
"
"Dandruff or flakes of skin in your dog’s fur
"
"Hot spots
"
"Hair loss (alopecia)
"
"Excessive scratching
"
"Hives (urticaria)
"
"Mites (cheyletiellosis), also called walking dandruff
"
"A rash can occur anywhere on a dog’s body. The location of the rash can provide some clues as to what health issue may have caused it:
"
"Belly rash or underarm rash: A belly rash on a dog is one of the more common reasons pet parents take their dogs to the vet. Rashes also often appear in a dog’s “underarms,” more accurately, the point where a dog’s front and hind legs meet the chest or abdomen. These rashes have many causes:
"
"Allergies
"
"Insect bites
"
"Irritation from a chemical substance, like fertilizer
"
"Bacterial infection
"
"Groin-area rash: Like a belly rash, a rash in your dog’s groin area is often due to:
"
"Allergies,
"
"Insect bites
"
"Infection
"
"A tumor: Male dogs with testicular tumors and unspayed females with hormone issues may have hair loss and a rash beginning in the groin area.
"
"Paw rash: Known as pododermatitis, this is inflammation of the paws that can include a rash. Causes can include:
"
"Infection
"
"Cancer
"
"Injury
"
"Irritating substances
"
"Lack of grooming
"
"Low levels of thyroid hormone
"
"Your vet will give your dog a physical exam and ask questions about your dog’s diet, current health issues, home environment, and other factors. To diagnose a rash, your veterinarian will perform a number of tests, depending on the suspected cause, including:
"
"Allergy tests if an allergen is suspected. This may include a food elimination diet or intradermal allergy testing.
"
"Skin scraping to look for mites, bacteria, fungus, or other potential causes.
"
"Skin biopsy, where a piece of skin is examined at a pathology laboratory (done in cases of recurring infection or rash).
"
"Blood profile to check for diseases such as thyroid issues (hypothyroidism) or Cushing’s disease
"
"To eliminate the rash and make sure it doesn’t come back, your vet will need to find and treat any underlying medical condition that’s causing it.
"
"They may also recommend several treatments for the rash and related symptoms. These may include:
"
"Grooming (such as brushing or cutting away hair)
"
"Oatmeal baths
"
"Medicated dog shampoo (containing antifungal or antibacterial ingredients)
"
"Anti-itch and anti-inflammatory medications
"
"Elizabethan collar or e-collar to prevent a dog from irritating hot spots by licking or biting
"
"Epsom salt foot soaks if your dog’s paws are inflamed. Follow your veterinarian’s instructions, as these can dry out the skin if used inappropriately. Do not allow your dog to drink the solution, which has high sodium levels.
"

"
"Depending on the cause and location of the rash (and accompanying symptoms), a veterinarian may recommend oatmeal baths, medicated dog shampoos, or medication to reduce itching and inflammation. Do not give your dog any medications without a veterinarian’s recommendation and guidance.
"
"Rashes can appear red, bumpy, inflamed, or like welts. There might be hair loss or hot spots, areas of  skin that are inflamed and oozing.
"
"Causes of rash in dogs are numerous and range from allergies and insect bites, which are most common, to thyroid conditions and cancer.

"Sinus tachycardia (ST) is clinically described as a sinus rhythm (heartbeat) with impulses that arise at a faster-than-normal rate: greater than 160 beats per minute (bpm) in standard sized dogs, 140 bpm in giant breeds, 180 bpm in toy breeds, and 220 bpm in puppies. Changes in heart rate usually involve a reciprocal action of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system.
"
"Severe tachycardia can compromise cardiac output, as too rapid rates shorten the diastolic filling time, the point in which the chambers of the heart dilate and fill with blood - which occurs in the space between heart beats. Particularly in diseased hearts, the increased heart rate can fail to compensate for decreased volume, resulting in decreased cardiac output, decreased coronary blood flow and a concurrent increase in oxygen demands. This is the most common benign arrhythmia in dogs. It is also the most common rhythm disturbance in postoperative patients.

"
"Because there are so many things that can cause this condition, it is difficult to diagnose and differentiate from other similar diseases. Your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by a deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms that you have provided and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis,which may show infections of the blood or disorders of the organs (e.g., heart, kidneys).
"
"Your doctor may also order chest X-rays to look for possible evidence of primary cardiac disease or tumors. An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) is essential for evaluating the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat), and may show structural cardiac diseases that are affecting the heart. Ultrasound and angiography are also very useful for evaluating adrenal masses. Your doctor may also conduct a thyroid scan to evaluate your dog for hyperthyroidism.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will develop a treatment plan for your dog once a diagnosis has been confirmed. If there is an underlying cause, that will be the primary focus of treatment.
"
"The care of your dog following diagnosis will depend on the specific disease that is found to be causing the sinus tachycardia. Restricting your dog's activity so that its heart rate does not increase excessively may be called for, but only if your dog is being adversely affected by the increased heart rate.

"A recessed vulva, also referred to as a hooded vulva, is when there is extra skin surrounding and folding over the vulva. This extra skin allows for moisture to be trapped underneath. 
"
"Female dogs that have hooded vulvas are more likely to develop vaginal infections (vaginitis) and urinary tract infections. Once bacteria grow within the skin fold of a hooded vulva, they move into the bladder and can cause a urinary tract infection. Yeast infections around the vulva are also more common in dogs that have hooded vulvas.
"
"Some dogs may not have any health issues caused by a recessed or hooded vulva, although this condition can cause chronic vaginitis and recurring urinary tract infections with irritation and pain. Infected skin around the vulva will look moist, red, or black and may have an odor.
"
"When a dog has vaginitis or a urinary tract infection, they may not show symptoms. This makes it difficult to determine that there is a problem. However, most dogs will show symptoms. For instance, if the skin around the vulva is infected, a dog will often lick excessively at the vulva due to itchiness and discomfort caused by the infection. Dogs may also scoot their rear end along the floor to try and “scratch the itch.”
"
"If a dog with a recessed vulva has a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common symptoms are:
"
"Most commonly called ""raccoon disease"" because of its prevalence in the raccoon population, baylisascariasis comes from contact with raccoon feces, and from ingesting animal tissue that is infected with the Baylisascaris procyonis parasite.
"
"Commonly referred to as roundworm, the B. procyonis larvae is found in a large part of the animal population, including humans -- making this a zoonotic disease, which means that it can be spread from an infected animal to other animal species, which includes humans. Raccoons are the optimal carriers of this worm, since the health of the raccoon is not adversely affected, making it the ideal host and disseminator of the parasite. The B. procyonis larvae is typically spread through the fecal material into the environment. Any contact with the feces, or with soil that has been used by an infected raccoon, may lead to systemic infection. Therefore, it is essential to practice methods of avoidance and caution in areas where raccoons are prevalent.
"
"Intermediate carriers are birds, rabbits and rodents, amongst other animals. The larva is known to migrate to the brain, where it affects the nervous system. In this weakened state, the small animal becomes an easy catch, and the larva is ingested when the predator animal (i.e., a dog) ingests tissue from the infected animal. This is another way in which the worm is disseminated to other animals.
"
"This disease is known to occur throughout the United States, with reported outbreaks in zoos and on farms. However, an outbreak can occur wherever animals are kept together in large groups.
"
"While this infection can often be treated in adult dogs, it is almost always fatal for puppies. In addition, because the worm sometimes attacks the brain and nervous system, this infection may be mistaken for rabies. If rabies is suspected, you may wish to ask your veterinarian to test for the presence of the B. procyonis.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Two types of baylisascariasis have been reported in dogs: intestinal infection and visceral disease. The development of the roundworm begins with ingestion of the roundworm eggs. They then migrate to the intestines, where they further develop before their final migration into the viscera (the organs that occupy the abdominal cavities), the nervous system, or the eye. These types of infections are referred to, respectively, as larval migrans; visceral larval migrans (VLM); neural larval migrans (NLM); and ocular larval migrans (OLM).
"
"The intestinal form is most commonly found in adult dogs, while infection of internal organs, particularly the brain and spinal cord (visceral disease) is more common in puppies. Often, there are not any outward symptoms associated with early onset of the disease, but occasionally dogs will show signs of neurological disease due to the worm attacking the nervous system. Signs of neurological disease (NLM) include:
"
"Infection of the viscera (VLM) may present symptoms of liver and/or lung disease, while infection of the eye (OLM) may not be apparent until your dog has lost the use of its vision.
 
"
"The most common method of acquiring the infection originates from sharing an area with infected raccoons. A dog can become infected with the disease from coming into contact with raccoon feces, from ingestion of B. procyonis eggs, which may remain viable in the soil long after the raccoon feces has disintegrated or been removed, from ingestion of animal tissue that is infected with the roundworm (e.g., rabbits, birds, etc.), or from close contact with other infected animals.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected. Knowing the path the parasite has taken is essential for treating the infection appropriately.
"
"The intestinal form of baylisascariasis is found by examining the dog's feces, while the larval form may be found in association with other diseases such as rabies, canine distemper, and congenital neurological defects. A direct fecal smear test will detect the intestinal form of the disease, while the larval form can usually be found through an eye (ophthalmoscopic) examination, or by a laboratory examination of a tissue sample.
"
"Urinating more frequently (polyuria)
"
"Drinking more water (polydipsia)
"
"Urinary accidents in the house
"
"Straining to urinate (squatting more but urine may not always come out)
"
"Bloody urine (hematuria)
"
"If there is a skin infection around the vulva, it can be diagnosed during a routine physical exam. To diagnose a urinary tract infection, a urine sample is needed for testing.
"
"A recessed vulva was once thought to be a genetic issue, but the genetic link has not yet been found.  Medium to large breeds are more prone to having a recessed vulva, compared to small or toy breeds. Obese dogs are at greatest risk, due to fatty tissue that accumulates around the vulva, causing a fold of skin to fully surround it.
"
"A recessed vulva can be diagnosed during a routine physical exam because the vulva will not be easily visible as it should be. Instead, it will be covered by a fold of skin that will need to be pushed back in order to see it properly. No tests are needed to diagnose it. 
"
"A veterinarian may perform a tape impression test if the skin around the vulva appears infected.  This test involves taking a small, clear piece of tape and gently applying it to any skin lesions around the vulva. The tape is then removed and stained. It will then be examined under the microscope to see if there are bacteria or yeast present. Topical or oral medication will be prescribed for treatment if a skin infection is diagnosed.
"
"If a dog with a recessed vulva is showing signs of a possible urinary tract infection, a urine sample will be needed for a urinalysis. This test helps diagnose an infection by checking for red and white blood cells, urinary crystals, and bacteria. It also checks kidney function and screens for diabetes.
"
"Dogs that have this condition and do not have any associated medical issues will not need treatment—only dogs with a recessed vulva that have vaginitis and/or urinary tract infections. Medicated anti-bacterial or anti-fungal wipes may be prescribed to help keep the skin clean around the vulva on a daily basis to prevent or minimize skin and urinary tract infections.
"
" If obesity is the suspected cause of a recessed vulva, a weight loss plan will be recommended. Weight loss may allow for the vulva to be properly exposed and eliminate a fold of skin covering it up. It is also possible that weight loss may not fully eliminate a recessed vulva, but it may lessen it, so that recurring skin infections and UTIs no longer develop. 
"
"Surgery is required for treatment if a dog is  a healthy body weight and has a recessed vulva that causes recurring skin and/ or urinary issues.. The surgery, called an episioplasty or vulvoplasty, involves surgical removal of extra skin around the vulva, allowing it to be exposed normally.
"
"If a dog is diagnosed with a recessed vulva and needs to be spayed, then a vulvoplasty can be done at the same time as the spay. If there is a severe skin infection around the vulva prior to surgery, this infection needs to be fully treated before surgery can be performed. 
"
"Oral medications, consisting of an antibiotic and pain medication, are prescribed after surgery to prevent infection and provide pain relief. A sedative is often prescribed as well to keep the dog calm after surgery. Dogs do recover quickly after a vulvoplasty, and their energy level and appetite are typically back to normal within 24 hours of surgery. However, the incision takes 10-14 days to heal.
"
"Post-surgery, it is important to:
"
"Limit the dog’s activity level until the stitches are removed in 10-14 days by a veterinary professional. This means taking the dog on short leash walks only.  No running, jumping, or rough play are allowed until the stitches are removed to ensure that the stitches do not pop during recovery.
"
"Provide crate rest to limit activity if the dog is crate-trained
"
"Use an e-collar (cone) around the dog’s head to prevent licking at the incision site, which can lead to infection and also cause the incision to open up.
"
"Monitor the incision site daily for redness, swelling, drainage, and an odor.  Report any of these findings to your local veterinary hospital as soon as possible if they are observed.
"
"The vulvoplasty should stop the recurring skin infections and ongoing UTIs if the recessed vulva was the cause. If a dog becomes obese after a vulvoplasty, a hooded vulva may develop again and cause vaginitis or UTIs.
"
"If a dog has ongoing vaginitis and UTIs due to a recessed vulva and does not have surgery or treatment for the infections, the infection around the vulva or bladder can cause a kidney infection. This can lead to kidney failure if left untreated, with decreased appetite, weight loss, vomiting, increased thirst, increased urination, urinary accidents, and ultimately a poor quality of life.
"
"A recessed vulva that causes recurring symptoms should always be treated to prevent long-term health issues.

"
"If your dog tests positive for this parasite, there are several medications that can be administered.
"
"For the intestinal form:
"
"For the larval form:
"
"A follow-up visit is recommended two weeks after the initial treatment, in order to analyze the feces for worms, and then again after a month to check for the intestinal form of the disease. This is a zoonotic disease, so it is transmissible to humans and other animals, with children being at the highest risk of acquiring the infection and of suffering the worst effects. Accidental ingestion of roundworm eggs can cause serious disease in humans. Ingestion may occur as a result of playing in sand that has been used by raccoons or other infected animals, from contact with soil that is infected with the eggs, or from contact with infected feces (during the course of cleaning it up). It is essential to be especially cautious until you have been assured that your dog has entirely recovered from the infection and is no longer shedding the eggs through its feces. Disposable gloves should be worn when handling your dog's waste materials, and hygiene regarding the hands and nails will need to be a priority if you live in an area that is occupied by raccoons.
"
"The location where your dog contracted the roundworm should be well observed and monitored, and neighbors should be notified of the risk to their own pets.
"
"The most important preventative step is to keep pets away from areas with raccoons and to prevent pets from ingesting animal tissue. Other steps that can be taken to protect your family and pet from this parasite are to keep sand boxes covered, check your property for raccoon droppings and deceased animals, and make sure that your dog or puppy has been dewormed.

"The ingredients in rodenticides, or rat poison, are extremely dangerous for dogs, and accidental ingestion is one of the most common forms of pet poisoning.
"
"Rat poisons come in a variety of colors—such as green, blue, tan, pink, and red—and formulations, including pellets, bait blocks, powders, pastes, cereal, and soft baits.
"
"Each of the four most common active ingredients in rat poisons have different mechanisms for poisoning and treatment for toxicity. Unfortunately, the active ingredient cannot be identified based on the appearance of the product or bait.
"
"If your dog eats rat poison, it is important that you bring any remaining bait or packaging to the vet with you to aid in identification of the active ingredient. 
"
"The four most common active ingredients are:  
"
"If your dog eats rat poison (regardless of amount or active ingredient), take them immediately to a local veterinary hospital for evaluation and treatment. 
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Clinical signs will vary depending on the active ingredient in the rat poison and the amount ingested. Unfortunately, symptoms often take 1-7 days to show after ingestion of a toxic dose.
"
"Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) refers to an abnormally rapid heart rate originating above the heart's ventricles. This can occur during times of rest or low activity (i.e., at times other than exercise, illness, or stress). A heart rate that remains excessively high over the long-term (such as those seen with SVT) can lead to progressive myocardial (heart muscle) failure as well as congestive heart failure.
"
"SVT may go unnoticed when it is periodic, but when there are repetitive supraventricular premature electrical heart depolarizations (changes in the heart's electrical potential) that originate from a site other than the sinus node (the pacemaker of the heart), such as in the atrial muscle or atrioventricular nodal tissue, the condition can become a serious health problem.
"
"There are several factors that may lead to SVT, including:
"
"Some dogs even develop SVT due to a genetic predisposition or because of an unknown reason.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms that you provide. Standard laboratory tests include a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out systemic disease, cancer, and electrolyte imbalances.
"
"An electrocardiogram (EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). An EKG (with Doppler studies) can also enable your veterinarian to characterize the type and severity of any underlying heart disease, as well as assess myocardial function for dogs suffering from primary SVT.
"
"Furthermore, long-term ambulatory (Holter) recording of the EKG may detect attacks of SVT in cases of unexplained fainting, while event (loop) recorders may detect paroxysmal (severe attacks) SVT in dogs with infrequent episodes of syncope (fainting).
"
"
"
"Dogs with sustained SVT or signs of congestive heart failure should be hospitalized immediately. There they may undergo a variety of non-pharmacologic, emergency interventions, including vagal maneuvers, precorial thump, and/or electrical cadioversion. Delivering a precordial thump is successful in terminating an SVT more than 90 percent of the time, but may break the ryhtym for only a brief period.
"
"To perform a precordial thump, the dog is placed on its right side and then ""thumped"" in the affected region with a fist while recording the EKG.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your dog as needed for treating the SVT and/or the underlying heart disease with prescription medication and/or dietary changes. He or she will recommend that you feed your dog a low sodium diet as well as restrict its activity until further notice. Short, low impact outdoor walks are ideal during this time.

"Many rodenticides contain dyes (red, green, blue, pink, and tan) that may stand out in your dog’s stool.  Any time you see foreign material in your pet’s stool, contact your veterinarian immediately.
"
"Clinical signs of anticoagulant rodenticides are based on signs of internal bleeding and may include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Pale gums
"
"Trouble breathing/increased breathing rate
"
"Weakness/collapse
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Less common signs can include bloody diarrhea, nose bleeds, bruising, bloody urine, swollen joints, bleeding from gums, vaginal bleeding (if pregnant), pharyngeal swelling, and even seizures (from bleeding in the brain)
"
"Clinical signs of cholecalciferol rodenticides are related to the hardening of soft tissues, with the kidneys being most susceptible, and may include:
"
"Weakness
"
"Anorexia/vomiting
"
"Increased thirst and increased urination (which may be a sign of acute kidney failure)
"
"Clinical signs of bromethalin rodenticides are related to the effects on the brain, and can include:
"
"Lack of coordination/stumbling
"
"Tremors/seizures
"
"Paralysis
"
"Clinical signs of zinc and aluminum phosphides will be related to the toxic phosphine gas that is produced. The gas itself is corrosive and can damage multiple organs. Clinical signs with this active ingredient can occur within minutes, and in severe cases death can occur in as little as 5 hours after exposure. Clinical signs may include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Vomiting (may be bloody)
"
"Diarrhea (may be bloody)
"
"Lack of coordination/weakness
"
"Tremor/seizures           
"
"Trouble breathing
"
"Stomach bloating/abdominal pain
"
"Phosphine gas has an odor of decaying fish or garlic and is extremely toxic to humans as well as pets.  If your pet vomits on the way to the veterinarian, be sure to roll down the windows (safely) for maximum ventilation. Any symptomatic person should seek advice from human poison control or medical professionals.
"
"Most rat poison cases in dogs are the result of unintentional ingestion of bait. In rare cases, poisoning may be due to malicious intent. When you and your dog are visiting a friend or family member or leaving a dog with a sitter, ask about potential poisons around the home.
"
"Poisoning in dogs can theoretically occur as a secondary or “relay toxicity” if a dog eats a rat who died from rat poison ingestion. This type of poisoning has never been documented in research, so while it is possible, it is considered highly unlikely.
"
"If you see your dog eat any type of rat poison or suspect that they may have ingested rat poisoning, take them immediately to your local veterinary emergency hospital. 
"
"An emergency vet will collect a thorough medical history to help their assessment. If possible, bring the bait packaging, because determining the active ingredient is crucial to treatment. Calling the pet poison hotlines may also be beneficial, as they can look up packaging information on the product. If possible, call the hotline while en route to your emergency veterinary hospital; time is of the essence in ensuring that your dog reaches medical care immediately.
"
"The veterinarian will start with a physical examination to assess your dog’s mental and neurological status and check for any bleeding, bruising, or abdominal pain. 
"
"A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry with electrolytes, and urinalysis will likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation. 
"
"Depending on the active ingredient, coagulation panels (PT/PTT) may also be recommended to check your dog’s ability to clot. Often at the time of your visit, bloodwork will appear to be normal and will need to be monitored over the next 1-7 days. Other tests such as chest or abdominal x-rays may be recommended, depending on your pet’s clinical signs.
"
"Dogs should be treated as soon as possible for rat poisoning. Treatment will vary based on the active ingredient involved, so it is extremely important to determine the type of rat poison.
"
"For most active ingredients, the vet will likely induce vomiting. (If the active ingredients include zinc and aluminum phosphides, the vet may induce vomiting in a well-ventilated area because of the risk to people. Activated charcoal may be given to treat other toxins.
"
"After vomiting, treatment will depend on the specific active ingredient ingested:
"
"Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are crucial in treating rat poisoning in dogs. All rat poisons, regardless of the active ingredient, can be fatal, and dogs have their best chances of survival if seen quickly by a veterinarian. Overall, the prognosis is very good for dogs who receive prompt treatment upon ingesting a rodenticide. 
"
"Most dogs will remain hospitalized for observation and treatment for 2-6 days, depending on the active ingredient and how much rat poison was ingested. Typically, blood tests will be performed several times.
"
"Prevention is key! Keep all rat poisons away from your dog and in a secure place. Consider an alternative form of pest control, such as live traps that do not include poisons.
"
"If you must put out rat poison:
"
"Keep a detailed record of how much was placed
"
"Know what kind of product (including the active ingredient)
"
"Take a picture of the ingredients in case you need to refer to it later for veterinarian treatment
"
"Mark where you dispensed the rat poison
"
"If your pet is going to visit a friend, family member, or sitter, be sure to ask if they have rat poison out and keep the dog away from those areas
"
"Never let dogs eat unidentified objects on walks, as these can include toxins and poisons and be hard to determine after the fact. Finally, remember to monitor your pet’s stool carefully, as many rodenticides contain dyes (red, green, blue, pink, and tan) that may be noticeable before severe symptoms begin.   
"
"Sometimes it can be very difficult to determine if your dog ingested rat poison if you did not witness them eating it. However, rodenticides contain dyes (red, pink, green, blue, and tan) that can often be seen after the fact in your dog’s stool. 
"
"Other times there are no indications until your dog becomes sick. If your pet has any of the symptoms listed above, take them to an emergency veterinary hospital immediately.  
"
"There are four main active ingredients in rat poisons—anticoagulant rodenticide, cholecalciferol, bromethalin, and zinc and aluminum phosphides. The amount of rat poison that is lethal to dogs will depend on the size of the dog and the active ingredient. However, since rat poisons are considered highly toxic and deadly, any ingestion of rat poison means your dog should be seen immediately by a veterinarian.

"Rabies is a viral disease that is fatal to almost all dogs who catch it. Fortunately, pet parents can help to prevent their dogs from becoming infected with the rabies virus with a canine rabies vaccine. 
"
"The Q fever disease is caused by the Coxiella burnetii, a pathogenic bacteria that is structurally similar to the Rickettsia bacteria but genetically different.
"
"A dogwill most commonly become infected with the organism if it ingests infected bodily fluids (i.e., urine, feces, milk, discharges), tissues, or diseased carcasses (e.g., those from cattle, sheep, or goats). The bacteria can also become airborne and is transmittable through fleas or lice, which carry C. burnetii in its parasitic form.
"
"Q fever is an worldwide endemic, affecting cats and dogs of any age, gender, or breed, and as a zoonotic disease, it is transmissible to humans. Care must be taken when dealing with bodily fluids, organs, and/or tissue material of any animal, particularly farm animals. Dispose of all birth remains properly and feed your dog pasteurized products only.
"
"If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in petMD health library.
"
"Lungs are thought to be the main portal of entry into systemic circulation. C. burnetii will then replicate in the organ's lining, causing widespread vasculitis. Inflammation of the dog's blood vessels will result in the death of its blood cells and hemorrhaging of the lungs, liver, and central nervous system.
"
"Once the dog has contracted the disease it may display some of the following symptoms:
"
"The types of symptoms your dog displays and the severity of the Q fever will ultimately depend on the particular strain of organism your dog is infected with. Often, animals with C. burnetii will undergo a period of latency (inactivity). However, during the birthing process the bacterium may reactivate, resulting in large numbers of bacteria entering the placenta, and the host's bodily fluids, urine, feces, and milk.
"
"Exposure to animals infected with C. burnetii (especially those that have just given birth), ticks, fleas, and lice.
"
"The rabies virus attacks the central nervous system (CNS), spreading through the nerves from the infection site to the brain. Infected animals experience paralysis that inevitably involves the respiratory system, and leads to death.  
"
"Rabies can affect any mammal, including humans. Animals that host and spread viruses like rabies are known as reservoirs for the disease. Possible hosts include skunks, weasels, and bats. Dogs and humans are moderately susceptible to all variants of the virus, and are not considered host reservoirs. 
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The initial symptoms of rabies may come on gradually and be hard to detect. These symptoms include fever, as well as decreases in energy and appetite. After 2-4 days, rabies symptoms tend to progress quickly to include weakness or paralysis of the legs, seizures, difficulty breathing, hypersalivation due to difficulty swallowing, and abnormal behavior. Changes in behavior can range from extreme aggression to depression or coma. 
"
"Classical rabies has two forms, furious and paralytic. Affected dogs may show signs of either or both forms. If the furious phase develops, dogs can become aggressive and occasionally delusional. They may seem to hallucinate and attack their surroundings with no trigger. The paralytic phase involves dogs starting to develop paralysis of various muscular systems. They often lose the ability to swallow, which leads to hypersalivation and foaming at the mouth—which some people consider to be a classic sign of rabies virus infection. 
"
"Eventually, coma and death occur after paralysis or prolonged seizure activity. 
"
"The most common way for a dog to become infected is through a bite from an infected animal, where the virus is transmitted by the saliva. Rarely, the saliva or nerve tissue of an infected animal can contaminate a dog’s open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth, leading to transmission of the virus without a bite occurring.
"
"There is no way to definitively diagnose rabies in a living animal, so it is essential to observe the signs and accurately interpret symptoms. If a vet suspects rabies based on the dog’s symptoms, a diagnosis can be made by testing the brain tissue after the dog has died. The brain tissue is examined using a method called direct fluorescent antibody testing.
"
"There is no treatment for rabies in dogs, and humane euthanasia is recommended if the disease is strongly suspected.
"
"Rabies is almost certainly fatal in dogs, and there is no hope of recovery or long-term management of the disease once a dog has been infected and has started to exhibit symptoms. For this reason, it is critical to keep your cat up to date on their rabies vaccine to ensure their health and safety should they become exposed to this disease.
"
"Rabies is most commonly spread by the bite of an infected animal or through the transfer of infected saliva into the open wound of a non-infected dog.
"
"If you suspect your dog has been exposed to rabies, take them to an emergency vet immediately. Dogs that have been vaccinated against rabies can be revaccinated as a preventive measure.
"
"Rabies will always be considered as a potential diagnosis if your dog has been exposed to an infected animal. This infection should also be suspected in dogs with sudden behavioral changes, neurologic symptoms (such as muscle weakness or paralysis), appetite changes, or respiratory symptoms, especially if other differential diseases can be ruled out. A definitive diagnosis of rabies can only be made after a dog has died.
"
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that about 60-70 dogs in the United States are infected with rabies each year.
"
"The rabies vaccine can prevent rabies infection. It is considered a core vaccine (one that all dogs should receive) and can be administered to a puppy starting at 14 weeks of age. A booster vaccine should then be given in 1 year, and every 1-3 years after.
"
"Providing a detailed history of your dog's health and its lifestyle leading up to the onset of the symptoms will assist your veterinarian in the diagnosis.
"
"Your veterinarian will then conduct a complete blood profile on your dog, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Once collected, the dog's blood serum will be refrigerated to assist in the identification of the organism's type. The veterinarian will also collect a tissue sample (e.g., from the placenta) and refrigerate it for later use as an inoculator.
"
"
"
"There are medications that are effective in eliminating the bacterial infection, and your veterinarian will guide you in creating an effective treatment plan for the dog. However, be aware that C. burnetii is more resistant to eradication than other types of Rickettsiae, a similar type of bacteria.
"
"Because of the zoonosis of Q fever, take extreme care when handling infected animals. To lessen the risk of transmitting the disease, your dog should be immediately hospitalized once it is found to have Q fever.
"
"It can be difficult to determine the success of therapy because many animals will spontaneously improve. However, even asymptomatic cases should be aggressively treated because of the potential for human infection.
"
"By the time a diagnosis is made in a dog, human exposure and infection have more than likely occurred. Therefore, anyone who has been in contact with the dog should also seek immediate medical attention. The incubation period from the time of contact until the first signs of illness is 5 to 32 days.
"
"Humans typically contract the disease by inhaling infected aerosols (i.e., airborne material), especially after an animal has given birth; children are commonly infected from ingesting raw dairy milk, but are usually asymptomatic. Person-to-person transmission is possible but rare.

"Pyruvate Kinase (PK) is an enzyme that plays an important role in energy generation and its deficiency impairs the red blood cells' (RBCs) ability to metabolize, which in turn may cause anemia and other blood-related issues.
"
" 
"
"Breeds more prone to PK deficiency include the basenji, beagle, West Highland white terrier, Cairn terrier, miniature poodle, dachshund, Chihuahua, pug, American Eskimo dogs.
"
" 
"
" 
"
" 
"
" 
"
"PK definciency is typically associated with a genetic defect acquired at birth.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC).
"
" 
"
"Blood testing may reveal an increased number of platelets as well as white blood cells (leukocytosis), anemia with abnormally large, pale red blood cells (RBCs),  abnormally-shaped RBCs called poikilocytes (poikilcytosis), and a variation in RBC color (polychromasia). The biochemistry profile, meanwhile, may show an excess of iron in the blood (hyperferremia), mild increase in bilirubin, and slight increase in liver enzymes. Lastly, urinalysis may reveal high levels of bilirubin.
"
" 

"
" 
"
"Bone marrow transplantation is the only available treatment for PK deficient dogs. However, this treatment is expensive and potentially life-threatening.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"Dogs that undergo a bone marrow transplant may have a normal lifespan. Unfortunately, those that are left untreated will typically die by four years of age as a result of bone marrow or liver failure. Most of these patients develop severe anemia and accumulation of fluid in abdominal cavity (ascites) during the terminal stage of the disease.

"Pyometra in dogs is a highly severe and potentially life-threatening infection of the uterus. In female dogs affected by this condition, the uterus becomes inflamed.
"
"This infection causes the formation of an abscess or the accumulation of pus within the uterus, which results in the dog becoming very ill.
"
"With pyometra, toxins and bacteria can infiltrate the wall of the uterus and then leak into the bloodstream. This accumulation of infection can quickly cause the tissue of the uterus to die.
"
"This tissue death (necrosis) can ultimately lead to a rupture of the uterus, causing large amounts of pus to be spilled into the abdominal cavity.
"
"Additionally, the buildup of toxins in the body can adversely affect the dog’s kidneys, potentially causing kidney failure. Without prompt and effective treatment, this condition can be fatal.
"
"Pyometra usually occurs two to eight weeks after a female dog’s heat (estrus) cycle. Unfortunately, it is a common condition in dogs who are not spayed and occurs in up to 25% of them.
"
"The good news is that this condition is very preventable by having your dog spayed when she is a puppy. Spaying removes the uterus and the source of the female hormones that drive the infection.
"
"Pyometra is a medical emergency. If you suspect your female dog is affected, she needs to be seen by her veterinarian or an emergency veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"The common symptoms of pyometra in dogs include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Fever
"
"Depression
"
"Poor appetite
"
"Increased thirst and increased urination (PU/PD)
"
"Vomiting
"
"Vaginal discharge (not always)
"
"Distended abdomen
"
"Pyometra can occur at any point in an unspayed female dog’s life after she has started her heat cycle, or she has become sexually mature.
"
"Pyometra can happen at any age but more commonly occurs in dogs that are more than 5 years old, after many heat cycles have produced significant changes to the female reproductive system over time.
"
"Pyometra is a uterine infection caused by hormonal changes in a female dog’s reproductive system. It commonly occurs shortly after a dog’s heat cycle when high levels of progesterone are still present, which is necessary to help the body prepare for a possible pregnancy.
"
"Progesterone causes thickening of the lining of the uterus, creating ideal conditions for bacteria to grow. It also decreases the ability of the muscles of the uterus to contract and remove any accumulated fluids or bacteria, as it should with a normal heat cycle.
"
"Researchers believe that E. coli, the primary bacteria causing pyometra in dogs, enters the uterus after ascending from the intestinal tract. E. coli accounts for 57–100% of pyometra cases in dogs.
"
"In recent years, there has also been an increase of pyometra in dogs who are fed raw meat. This can increase the number of bacteria present in a dog’s stool, primarily salmonella and E. coli.
"
"A decreased amount of white blood cells in the uterus also contributes to pyometra. White blood cells play a key role in removing infections from the body.
"
"During a dog’s heat cycle, these white blood cells are inhibited from entering the uterus. This is a normal protective mechanism to allow sperm to safely enter the uterus without being destroyed by the white blood cells.
"
"The combination of increased hormones and decreased white blood cells often leads to life-threatening pyometra in dogs. Pyometra can also occur in unspayed female dogs who have been given estrogen or progesterone medications.
"
"A common misconception about pyometra in dogs is that you can always see pus coming from the vagina, but this isn’t true. The cervix is usually tightly closed, except when a dog is in or recently has been in heat.
"
"When the cervix is open and the uterus is thickened, it creates the perfect environment for bacteria to enter the uterus and multiply. There are two kinds of pyometras categorized by the state of the dog’s cervix.
"
" An open cervix will allow pus, with or without bloody discharge, to exit from the vagina. With a closed cervix there is no vaginal discharge present, and the enlarged uterus can cause a distended abdomen. A closed pyometra will progress much faster than an open pyometra.
"
"This situation is far more serious because it can often be confused with many other disease processes, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.
"
"Open pyometras are more common than closed ones.
"
"Pyometra is diagnosed by a variety of factors, including a physical examination.
"
"If there is vaginal discharge present, a sample can be collected and analyzed under a microscope to detect the presence of bacteria and other cells present right after estrus.
"
"Your veterinarian will likely also recommend some imaging, such as ultrasound or X-rays of the abdomen, to look for the distended, fluid-filled uterus.
"
"Bloodwork is also performed to look for evidence of infection and potential kidney involvement.
"
"Pyometra is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment.
"
"The primary treatment for pyometra is spaying the affected dog. This is a surgical procedure called an ovariohysterectomy, which involves removal of the uterus and ovaries.
"
"Extreme caution is taken during the surgery to make sure that pus and bacteria are not spilled into the abdominal cavity. Because pyometra surgery is considerably more complex than a routine spay on a healthy dog, it typically costs five to 10 times more.
"
"If the uterus has already ruptured and there is pus in the abdominal cavity, your vet will need to flush the abdomen repeatedly during the surgery to prevent sepsis, a systemic infection caused by bacteria in the blood. Antibiotics are also given during and after surgery to help prevent sepsis.
"
"Pain medication is given during and after the operation as well, to help manage the dog’s discomfort.
"
"Depending on how sick they are or have become, dogs will need to stay hospitalized for a few days or longer for IV fluids and other medical treatments.
"
"There is an alternative treatment available for a dog with pyometra, but it is generally not recommended.
"
"This alternative is considered when a pet parent still wants their dog to be able to reproduce and have puppies. Even if these treatments are successful, they leave the dog highly vulnerable to another pyometra, so she needs to be monitored very closely.
"
"The alternative treatment involves the use of prostaglandin, a hormone that can be given by injection. It is used to induce uterine contractions to expel the pus from the body. These injections can be attempted only in cases of open pyometra, not closed ones.
"
"After receiving prostaglandin injections, the dog must be bred and go through a successful pregnancy during their next heat cycle or the reoccurrence rate of the pyometra is very high, estimated at 77%.
"
"Without surgery or a successful prostaglandin injection, it is nearly impossible for a dog to recover from pyometra. If treatment is not performed as soon as possible, the toxic bacteria will be fatal.
"
"During recovery from surgery, it’s important that you monitor your dog very closely. Recovery usually takes a few weeks, but it can be longer if your dog is very ill.
"
"She should wear a protective collar or surgical suit to ensure she cannot lick her incision. Antibiotics are given for at least two weeks after surgery.
"
"It’s also recommended that your dog be on strict rest during this recovery period of at least two weeks after surgery.
"
"She should not be allowed to run, jump, or roughhouse, as that can put tension on the surgical incision, causing an infection or causing the incision to open.
"
"It might even be a good idea to keep her crate-rested for the recovery period, especially if there are other pets in the house who might disturb her incision.
"
"If the incision opens, your dog might need another surgery to repair it. Often, your vet might prescribe pain medication that doubles as a sedative as well to help keep your dog as relaxed as possible while she heals.
"
"Without surgery or a successful prostaglandin injection, it’s very unlikely that a dog will recover from pyometra. If treatment is not performed as soon as possible, the toxic bacteria will be fatal.
"
"The earliest signs of pyometra can be nonspecific, meaning that they do not automatically point to an infected uterus.
"
"These signs include lethargy, vomiting, and a change in appetite, with or without vaginal discharge.

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Puppy strangles is a rare skin condition most commonly diagnosed in puppies. It is also called juvenile cellulitis, sterile granulomatous dermatitis, or lymphadenitis.

Strangles is characterized by sudden-onset facial swelling (especially of the muzzle and eyelids) followed by swollen lymph nodes in the neck. As the lymph nodes become increasingly swollen, it might look like your puppy is being strangled. The condition also causes oozing, crusted, pimple-like lesions on the skin, which are usually painful.
"
" When the swelling first starts, many pet owners mistakenly assume that their puppy has been bit by a snake or spider. Regardless of the underlying cause, any significant swelling means that you should take your dog to the vet right away. In many cases, strangles can be life-threatening, if left untreated.
"
"Strangles usually affects young dogs between the ages of 3 weeks to 6 months, but it has been diagnosed in dogs up to 4 years old.
"
"Symptoms of puppy strangles may include:
"
"Fever
"
"Facial swelling
"
"Lymph node enlargement (usually starting with the lymph nodes under the chin and in the neck area)
"
"Joint swelling
"
"Lethargy
"
"Pain
"
"Bleeding, crusted, oozing skin pustules (most commonly on the face, muzzle, and ears) but can also affect the paws, anus, and genital regions.
"
"Loss of appetite
"
"Pyoderma is the medical term for a bacterial skin infection and it is one of the most common diseases in dogs. Dogs are at increased risk for pyoderma due to many features of their skin. For example, a dog’s skin has a thinner outer barrier and possesses a higher pH than many other species, making it easier for normal bacteria living on the skin to overgrow and for other bacteria to invade.
"
"Damage to the normal skin barrier also predisposes dogs to pyoderma. This is often seen with pets who scratch and lick their skin. Any area of the skin can be infected depending on the type of pyoderma affecting your dog.
"
"Surface pyoderma affects the outer skin layer (epidermis). You may see pink, irritated skin, and hair loss. Surface pyoderma includes:
"
"Pyotraumatic dermatitis (“hot spots”): This develops rapidly and is very itchy.
"
"Intertrigo: Infection of skin folds, a common condition in short-muzzled breeds, such as English Bulldogs.
"
"Bacterial overgrowth syndrome (BOGS): The dog’s skin is greasy, itchy, and smells. It is most seen on the underside of the body.
"
"Superficial pyoderma affects the epidermis and part of the hair follicles. You may see redness, circular crusts, bumps, and hair loss. Superficial pyoderma includes:
"
"Impetigo (“puppy pyoderma”): This is an infection that is usually due to a puppy’s developing immune system and affects areas with little hair, like the belly.
"
"Affected puppies are usually healthy overall and in mild cases may only need a topical treatment. Adult dogs that are immunocompromised can also develop impetigo.
"
"Superficial bacterial folliculitis (SBF) and superficial spreading pyoderma: A dog’s coat may have a “moth-eaten” appearance due to widespread hair loss. This happens in all breeds, but Shetland Sheepdogs, Border Collies, Australian Shepherds, and Collies may experience especially severe redness and irritation.
"
"Mucocutaneous pyoderma: This type of pyoderma leads to the overproduction of mucus in the skin. The lips, nose, skin around the eyes, vulva, prepuce, and the area around the anus are most commonly affected. German Shepherds, Bichon Frisés, and poodles may be predisposed.
"
"Deep pyoderma affects lower skin layers (dermis, subcutis): This can occur if superficial pyoderma goes untreated or skin follicles rupture. You may see swelling, purple-looking areas, or draining tracts of infection in addition to redness, crusting, and hair loss. Deep pyoderma includes:
"
"Furunculosis: This condition is commonly seen between a dog’s toes, but it can occur elsewhere. In rare cases, a condition called post-grooming furunculosis can occur 24 to 48 hours after bathing or intense brushing, causing pain and fever.
"
"Acne: This is more common among young dogs, and involves inflammation of hair follicles (usually around the chin and mouth) that may become infected with bacteria.
"
"German Shepherd deep pyoderma: The outer thighs, groin, and trunk are likely to be affected.
"
"Lick granuloma: Your dog may develop a skin lesion from licking the top surface of its lower legs. This may stem from a bacterial infection or another issue.
"
"Callus pyoderma: This condition presents itself as dark, thickened skin over pressure points that are infected.
"
"Dogs with pyoderma may have red and itchy skin. You may also see circular crusts, flakiness, areas of hair loss, and pimple-like lesions. If your dog has been scratching or biting its skin, your pet may have visible sores and pus.
"
"If your dog has suffered from itchy skin for several weeks or more, you may see the skin get darker and thicker. Dogs with deep pyoderma may have swelling and draining tracts of infection, and experience low energy, loss of appetite, trembling, or other signs of pain.
"
"Pyoderma usually occurs secondary to another illness or disease process. It may occur as a complication of:
"
"Allergies to fleas, environmental allergens, or a food ingredient
"
"A parasitic skin infection, like Sarcoptes or Demodex mites
"
"An endocrine disease, such as hypothyroidism or Cushing’s disease
"
"Immune disorders or immunosuppression
"
"A bacterial infection may need to be cleared before additional testing for the underlying cause can be completed. The most common bacterial infection that causes pyoderma is Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, which is responsible for more than 90 percent of cases. This type of bacteria normally inhabits the skin, but it can increase in number and cause problems when the skin barrier is damaged or unhealthy.
"
"Other causes include Staphylococcus schleiferi, Staphylococcus aureus (which in rare cases can spread to humans), as well as invaders like E. coli, Pseudomonas, Actinomyces, Nocardia, and others.
"
"Decreased drinking
"
"Hair loss
"
"Limping/lameness
"
"No one knows exactly what causes puppy strangles, but experts think it’s triggered by an inappropriate immune system reaction because it occurs most commonly in young dogs whose immune systems are not completely formed. It also tends to respond to high doses of steroids which work by suppressing the immune system.
"
"There may also be a hereditary component because certain breeds—including Golden Retrievers, Gordon Setters, and Dachshunds—are more likely to develop it.
"
"Your veterinarian will start by physically examining your dog and looking for symptoms such as symmetrical facial swelling, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and crusted, painful, raised skin lesions. While these symptoms strongly point to strangles, your veterinarian will likely perform the following tests to further investigate:
"
"Bloodwork, such as a complete blood count: Dogs with strangles often have an elevated white blood cell count and mild-to-moderate anemia (low red blood cell count).
"
"Cytology of the skin lesions: This involves placing a glass slide directly on the oozing lesions and then examining the sample under a microscope (or sending it to a lab for assessment). The sample is used to determine whether the dog has developed a secondary bacterial infection because of having strangles.
"
"Skin scrapings and hair pluck testing: These tests can help rule out mange, fungus, and ringworm, which are all other possible causes of skin lesions.
"
"Bacterial or fungal cultures: These tests may be recommended to rule out infection.
"
"Skin biopsy: This can provide a definitive diagnosis of puppy strangles because it checks for types of skin changes (such as granulomas and pyogranulomas) that are specific to this condition. But it is an aggressive test, and oftentimes the condition can be diagnosed and treated without it.
"
"Puppy strangles is painful and makes your dog vulnerable to bacterial infections. If such an infection spreads, or if your dog is in so much pain that it stops eating, strangles could become fatal.
"
"Fortunately, treatment is very effective. Treatment for puppy strangles is aimed at calming your pet’s overactive immune response and relieving its inflammation. Your veterinarian will most likely prescribe Prednisone (a type of steroid) or another type of immunosuppressive medication like Cyclosporine.
"
"Your dog may need to take high doses of steroids for several weeks or months during treatment, and the dose will need to be slowly tapered once the dog shows signs of improvement. Your dog will also need antibiotics if any of the skin lesions have become infected with bacteria. Your veterinarian might also prescribe a pain medication to ease your dog’s discomfort.
"
"In most cases, dogs with puppy strangles will start to get better within a few days of starting treatment, but it may take 10 to 14 days for the condition to fully resolve. Note that some hair loss or skin scarring might be permanent. It is important to avoid popping any pustules as this can be painful to your dog and make it easier for a bacterial infection to set in.
"
"There is no known way to prevent puppy strangles at this time, but once it is treated it usually does not flare up again.
"
"Yes, with appropriate therapy, puppies will fully recover.
"
"Puppy strangles is idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown. It is likely caused by an overreaction of the immune system because it tends to respond to high doses of steroids (which suppress the immune system).
"
"No, puppy strangles are not contagious to other animals or humans.
"
"Complete resolution of symptoms—with treatment—is usually seen in 10 to 14 days, but in more severe cases it can be longer.

"
"In order to diagnose your dog with pyoderma, your veterinarian will need to start with a physical exam. Based on the presence of certain lesions—such as pustules (bumps that look like pimples)— the veterinarian may be comfortable diagnosing your pet based on what he or she determines from the physical exam. Diagnostic testing is usually necessary, and may include:
"
"Culture and sensitivity: A swab of the affected skin area may be sent to a diagnostic laboratory for fungal and/or bacterial culture and sensitivity testing. Results typically take several days and enable vets to pinpoint the exact types of bacteria and/or fungus that are the root causes of the infection.
"
"Your vet will also prescribe the medication that will work best to treat that specific infection. Ringworm culture may be performed in-house at your veterinary clinic. Bacterial culture and susceptibility are recommended if your pet has recurrent skin infections, or the infection is deep and severe.
"
"Use of an Elizabethan collar (or e-cone) is recommended if your pet is licking or biting its skin. This will  prevent reinfection and allow the skin to heal.
"
"Medications your veterinarian may recommend include:
"
"If you do not notice an improvement (lesions drying up, reduced itchiness, etc.) after a few days of treatment, please call your veterinarian. Culture and sensitivity may be needed to determine which antibiotic will be effective.
"
"Topicals your veterinarian may recommend include:
"
"Re-check appointments with your veterinarian will ensure that your dog’s infection has completely cleared before its antibiotic treatment has ended. Treatment may need to be continued for 7 to 14 days past when their skin appears normal, so please do not stop the antibiotics before a full course of treatment has been completed. Ending antibiotic treatment too early can contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance.
"
"Infection often needs to be cleared before your veterinarian can begin investigating the underlying cause of the pyoderma. It is important to determine the underlying cause, whether it be allergies, Cushing’s disease, hypothyroidism, or another illness, so your dog doesn’t experience frequent relapses of pyoderma.
"
"The length of treatment will vary depending on the type and severity of your pet’s pyoderma. Many cases of superficial pyoderma require treatments lasting three to four weeks. Deep pyoderma may require treatment that lasts for months. Do not stop treatment without the direct recommendation of your pet’s veterinarian.
"
"It is rare for humans to catch pyoderma from their dogs, though it is possible (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus). Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, the most common cause of canine pyoderma, does not lead to disease in humans.
"
"Pyoderma is typically easily treated on an outpatient basis with good outcomes. However, deep pyoderma can be more serious and in rare and extreme cases, require hospitalization.

"Pyothorax occurs when pus accumulates in the chest (pleural) cavity in response to an infection. Made up of white blood cells (neutrophils) and dead cells, pus is the body's natural immune response to an infection. Eventually, the white blood cells die, leaving the thick whitish-yellow fluid that is characteristic of pus.
"
"Pus that accumulates in the chest cavity, however, differs from an abscess, in that it does not create an enclosed wall of tissue to inhibit the bacteria from spreading. Instead, the pus forms into sacs that line the pleura, eventually scarring the cavity and severely impairing lung function.
"
"A bacterial infection that settles in the chest cavity can enter from the lungs or esophagus. Dogs generally get these types of infections from inhaling foreign objects like grass awns (bristles on the tips of grass), or from chest piercing wounds.  Hunting dogs and sporting breeds are most likely to develop such infections.
"
"The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how pyrothorax affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Some common symptoms associated with pyrothorax include:
"
"The most common causes for pyrothorax include infections with the bacteria:
"
"Other causes include bacterial and fungal infections, which are usually due to agents found in the soil; e.g., actinomycosis, nocardiosis
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health as well as its symptoms and and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as any fight wounds or chest injuries your pet might have sustained.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam, checking your dog’s chest for inflammation of cellular tissue (cellulites) or scarring. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel. In addition a  urinalysis sample of fluid from the chest cavity will be sent to the laboratory for cytologic (microscopic) evaluation and gram staining -- a procedure that makes bacteria more visible by causing it to stand out from the other cells.
"
"A sample of the fluid in the pleural cavity will be sent for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures (bacteria that need oxygen, and bacteria that does not, respectively), and for serological testing to detect the presence of a fungal agent. If parasite S. lupi  is suspected, an examination of the esophagus (esophagoscopy) can be done.
"
"Your veterinarian can also use X-ray and ultrasound imaging to examine the interior of the dog's chest cavity. These images will show fluid in the chest cavity, possible lung hardening (consolidation), lung collapse, and/or masses.
"
"
"
"Dogs with this condition should be hospitalized in the intensive care unit for treatment. It may take several days to weeks to fully eradicate the infection.  Drainage of the chest cavity through a tube is critical; otherwise, the condition cannot be resolved. The chest cavity will be rinsed out (through the chest tube) every six to eight hours with warm, sterile saline.
"
"Coupage -- a technique that involves rapidly slapping the chest wall, but not with enough force to injure the animal -- may help remove debris from the chest cavity. A bacterial culture will be repeated if your dog's condition does not improve.
"
"The infected dog should be encouraged to lightly exercise  -- 10 minutes every six to eight hours -- to promote breathing and speed up the recovery process. If there are abscesses in the lungs, stiffening of the lining of the chest cavity, lung-lobe twisting, extensive clumping of pustules, or if the mediastinum is involved, surgery will be indicated.
"
"Surgery will also be necessary for removing a foreign body if your veterinarian can find it on X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
"
"If your veterinarian chooses to perform a thoracotomy, your pet will be treated with pain medication following the procedure, and antibiotics to prevent infection from the incision. The type of antibiotics may be changed depending on the results of the culture and sensitivity tests.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule monthly follow-up appointments for your pet after it is discharged from the hospital, including complete blood counts and X-rays to follow its progress.  While there may be some lung damage remaining in the chest cavity, resulting from the pus formations, fluid should be absent.
"
"An antibiotic regimen should be continued for at least a month after the infection has cleared, or when the blood work results are normal or there is no evidence of fluid re-accumulation on the dog's X-ray. This antibiotic treatment regimen is generally between 3 to 12 months, although it may take longer.
"
"The prognosis is fair to excellent with continuous antibiotic therapy and sufficient drainage of the chest cavity. Your dog’s exercise level can gradually be returned to normal over a period of two to four months.

"A pyometra is a severe bacterial infection in the reproductive tract that causes the formation of purulent (pus or containing pus) material to develop in the uterus. This occurs secondary to hormonal changes in female dogs. 
"
"Cystic endometrial hyperplasia is often used synonymously with the term pyometra, and while these terms are often associated with one another they are not the same. Cystic endometrial hyperplasia is a thickening of the uterine tissue which then makes for an ideal environment for a pyometra to occur. 
"
"Bacteria and toxins from the infection can leak through the wall of the uterus and into a dog's bloodstream, causing a body-wide infection (sepsis). The uterus becomes very fragile, and pus can start to leak into the abdomen. 
"
"Without treatment, this can be a life-threatening condition.

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The symptoms of a pyometra can be vague, and it may resemble other types of infectious diseases. Generally, a veterinarian would become suspicious of a pyometra in a dog that finished her heat cycle about 1-2 months earlier and has one or more of the following symptoms:  
"
"Pustular to bloody vaginal discharge 
"
"Poor appetite 
"
"Vomiting/diarrhea 
"
"Drinking a large amount of water 
"
"Lethargy/depression 
"
"Fever 
"
"With an “open” pyometra, the cervix is open, and the infectious material inside the uterus leaks out through the vagina/vulva. You may see a small to moderate amount of this pustular material on your pet’s vulva or tail, but you may also notice it on your pet’s bed or where she has been sleeping. 
"
"However, a pyometra can also occur with a closed cervix. In this case, no discharge will be able to escape the uterus, making diagnosis more difficult. Since the infection is trapped inside the body, these dogs present with more serious symptoms. 
"
"While this is a disease of non-spayed females, there can be a very rare infection of the uterine tissue which remains after a pet is spayed. We call this a “stump” pyometra. Symptoms will be very similar to a standard pyometra, but the pet may have been spayed many weeks to several years before. 
"
"Starting at approximately 6 months of age, once a pet becomes hormonally mature, a dog will go through a heat cycle every 6 months or so. Each cycle brings the possibility of pregnancy. The uterine lining will thicken in preparation to potentially be the home of a growing embryo. 
"
"In a rare occurrence, the lining continues to thicken abnormally, and cysts form from glands within the wall of the uterus. This abnormal tissue becomes excessive and persistent. It is called cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH). 
"
"The exact cause of CEH is not known, but the hormones progesterone and estrogen during successive cycles are definitive factors. Successive cycles means that the likelihood of a dog developing a pyometra increases with each heat cycle that she goes through, as hormonal effects accumulate on the uterus. 
"
"However, pyometras can occur in any reproductively active pet, including dogs that are only 4-6 months old. Once CEH occurs, the engorged uterine tissue is a great breeding ground for an infection. While the uterus is a sterile environment, the vagina is not. Bacteria from the vagina travel into the uterus and become the source of infection for the pyometra. 
"
"The bacteria that most commonly cause pyometras are Escherichia coli (E. coli), staphylococcus, streptococcus, and pseudomonas.
"
"When a pyometra is open, the purulent/pustular vaginal discharge makes the diagnosis of a pyometra much easier. When there is no discharge, a diagnosis can be challenging. Your vet may do the following to confirm a diagnosis: 
"
"Blood work: While there is no specific blood test to diagnose a pyometra, blood work tends to be consistent with widespread infection or inflammation. Typically, these pups will have very high levels of white blood cells; however, with dogs that have severe infections, normal or even low white blood cell counts can be possible, as white blood cells leave the blood system and head to the uterus to start fighting on the front lines.  
"
"Elevation in a particular group of blood proteins called globulins can also be seen, as these blood proteins often increase when the immune system is active. Damage to the liver and kidneys may also be seen with severe infections. 
"
"Radiographs or X-rays: Radiographs tend to show an enlarged uterus. The uterus may be grossly swollen, making pyometra easy to diagnose. Other times, it is not as obvious, and confirmation with an ultrasound may be required. 
"
"Ultrasound: An enlarged uterus does not always mean a pyometra; this could also be explained by a pregnancy, hydrometra (fluid distension of the uterus), uterine torsion (twisting of the uterus), or cancer. An abdominal ultrasound can be very helpful to differentiate between a pyometra and other possible conditions. 
"
"Physical exam: Your vet will evaluate your dog with a physical exam and weigh the results of the diagnostic tests to determine the best course of treatment. 
"
"Surgical removal of the uterus and ovaries, the definitive treatment for a pyometra, removes the source of the hormones and infected uterine tissue. If the ovaries are not removed, they will continue to produce hormones which can affect even the small stump of uterus that is left behind. 
"
"This surgery is much more complex than a routine spay, even though in both surgeries the ovaries and uterus are removed. Once the uterus is infected, it can be quite challenging to remove it safely. 
"
"Many dogs will require intravenous (IV) fluid therapy to help with dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities before surgery can be performed. Antibiotics are generally given during the surgery and continued for 7-14 days after surgery. 
"
"Pain medications are needed after any major surgery, and a pyometra surgery is no exception. Most dogs will most likely need to stay hospitalized for 24-48 hours after surgery for continued care.  
"
"Treatment of a stump pyometra involves removing the infected uterine stump and finding and removing the source of hormones that caused the formation of the stump pyometra in the first place. This may be a small portion of ovary that was left behind after a spay, or, in rare occurrences, a piece of ectopic ovarian tissue, where hormone-producing cells are found outside of the normal ovary locations.  
"
"For breeding animals, there is a medical approach to treating pyometras. However, it is not often recommended, as the success rate is variable. There is considerable risk, and often long-term breeding complications still occur. Please discuss this alternative thoroughly with your veterinary reproductive specialist. 
"
"Prevention is the key to success, as a spay procedure generally keeps a pyometra from ever becoming an issue. If your pet does have surgery for pyometra, surgical recovery at home is similar to that with a spay: 
"
"Your pup will need a calm and safe space to stay during recovery. A large kennel or a small room is preferred. 
"
"Limit activity to leash walks for elimination purposes only, as any increase in activity can put additional strain on the incision site. 
"
"It is very important for your pet to not lick the incision. An e-collar or a surgical suit will help with these recovery efforts. 
"
"Check the incision daily for redness, swelling, and/or discharge. 
"
"Medications like anti-inflammatories, pain medication, and antibiotics should be given as directed by your vet. 
"
"If your dog is not eating or is experiencing lethargy, pain, vomiting, or diarrhea, contact your vet immediately. 
"
"Hormonal effects in the uterus can cause a buildup of uterine tissue, which can then become infected by bacteria traveling up from the vagina. The uterus fills with an infection, causing the dog to become ill.
"
"Pyometras can happen in dogs of any age, though it is statistically more likely in an older dog that has not been spayed. One to three months after a dog’s last heat cycle tends to be the time frame in which a pyometra is most likely to occur.
"
"A closed pyometra can be a life-threatening condition if immediate medical attention is not taken. Even with an open pyometra, the toxic effects from the bacterial infection can be fatal if left untreated.

"A pulmonary contusion in dogs is an injury or bruising to the lungs that results from a blunt trauma to the dog’s chest (thoracic cavity) due to an impact with a dull, firm surface or object—such as when the dog is hit by a car. This injury causes a hemorrhage, or uncontrolled bleeding, from the damage done to the blood vessels in and around the lungs.
"
"Pulmonic stenosis is a congenital heart defect in dogs. Stenosis means a narrowing, so pulmonic stenosis refers to narrowing of the valve between the right ventricle (a chamber of the heart) and the pulmonic artery (the major blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs).  The valve may be narrowed due to thickening of the leaflets and/or partially fused together.  This condition is congenital (present at birth) and likely has a genetic and hereditary component. 
"
"Pulmonic stenosis results in increased pressures in the right side of the heart, which can lead to thickening of the heart muscle, heart failure, arrhythmias, and even sudden death.  Puppies with pulmonic stenosis often have other congenital heart defects such as aortic stenosis and ventricular septal defect. 
"
" 
"
"In some dogs with mild narrowing, there are no clinical signs, and they never experience symptoms of disease.
"
"Pulmonary contusions can range from mild bruising in one lung lobe to severe hemorrhage of the entire lung. Contusions can develop and progress for up to 24–48 hours after a blunt force trauma to the thoracic cavity and the lungs. Dogs that have suffered such a trauma might initially appear to be breathing normally, but this bleeding can rapidly worsen as time goes on and cause your dog to develop serious respiratory distress and even death.
"
"If your dog has any trauma to the chest or body, it should be considered and treated as a medical emergency. Your dog should go to their veterinarian or an emergency vet as soon as possible and remain there for treatment and observation for at least 48–72 hours.
"
"The following are clinical signs associated with pulmonary contusions in dogs. The severity of the signs and symptoms will depend on the extent of the trauma and how much lung tissue is affected.
"
"Rapid, abnormal breathing (tachypnea)
"
"Trouble breathing
"
"Coughing, with or without blood or blood-tinged fluid
"
"Blood from the nose (epistaxis)
"
"Signs of thoracic trauma, such as broken ribs
"
"Vomiting, retching
"
"Wheezing, especially during exhalation
"
"Wobbly gait or inability to stand
"
"Blue or purple gums
"
"Pale gums
"
"Vocalizing excessively
"
"Pulmonary contusions can occur after any blunt trauma, such as:
"
"Being hit by a car
"
"Falling from a significant height
"
"Abuse or cruelty by humans
"
"Being kicked by another animal
"
"Non-penetrating bite wounds
"
"Crushing injury
"
"Motor vehicle accidents (where a dog is hit by a car) are the most common cause of pulmonary contusion in dogs. Pulmonary contusions occur in 40–50% of dogs with chest injuries and should be suspected if your dog has been hit by a car.
"
"However, in dogs with more severe narrowing, the fast and turbulent movement of blood and thickening of the right ventricle result in:
"
"Murmur (ranging from mild to severe)
"
"Exercise intolerance
"
"Fainting (syncope)/collapse
"
"Arrhythmias:
"
"Right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF)
"
"Ascites (fluid buildup)
"
"Pulmonary stenosis is congenital; dogs are born with the defect and there could be an inherited component in some breeds. The breeds most affected by the condition are:
"
"English and French Bulldogs
"
"Terriers (Jack Russell Terriers)
"
"Labrador Retrievers
"
"Miniature Schnauzers
"
"American Cocker Spaniels
"
"Samoyeds
"
"Keeshonden
"
"Mastiffs
"
"Beagles
"
"Most cases of pulmonary stenosis in dogs are detected during a routine puppy examination, first with detection of a heart murmur, an arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), or other signs of heart failure such as fluid buildup.
"
"A heart murmur is heard by listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and refers to turbulence in the blood flow, regardless of cause. Because there are other causes of blood turbulence, a heart murmur alone doesn’t necessarily indicate pulmonary stenosis. Once a murmur is heard, additional diagnostic tests may be needed, including:
"
"Radiographs  
"
"Electrocardiography (ECG)
"
"Echocardiography
"
"Cardiac catheterization using balloon valvuloplasty is typically the treatment of choice.
"
"Balloon valvuloplasty, a minimally invasive procedure that opens the narrowed heart valve, is the treatment of choice for pulmonic stenosis in dogs. This procedure is only performed at specialized veterinary cardiology referral centers, and involves threading a catheter with a balloon into the heart and then dilating the balloon. The goal is to open the narrowed pulmonic valve and improve blood flow.
"
"Diagnosis of pulmonary contusions in dogs is based on a recent history of trauma to the thorax/chest, symptoms of respiratory distress, or diagnostic testing. Since pulmonary contusions can take up to 48 hours to develop, your dog might initially have no clinical signs. X-rays of the chest might initially be within normal limits, but as time goes on, they can start to become abnormal and show signs of fluid in or around the lungs.
"
"After a complete medical history is taken and a physical exam is done, other diagnostic testing in addition to X-rays might be needed to assess your dog’s injuries and susceptibility to developing pulmonary contusions. Your veterinarian will also run baseline blood work to look for evidence of anemia or other adverse effects from having a traumatic accident. If possible, a blood gas analysis will be done to assess your dog’s ability to breathe normally and oxygenate their blood.
"
"If your dog has sustained blunt force trauma, it should be taken to the vet right away. While you are on the way to the vet, it’s best to have your dog in a crate or doggy car seat to ensure their safety. Ideally, have another person sit in the car near the dog to give them extra love and attention and keep them as calm as possible.
"
"Pulmonary contusions require aggressive treatment, including keeping your dog in the hospital for at least a few days. In mild cases, oxygen therapy is needed by putting small tubes into your dog’s nose or having them wear a special mask. If your dog does not tolerate this, most hospitals have a special oxygen cage to place them in.
"
"In severe cases, blood in the lungs is suctioned through the mouth, and then your dog will need to be intubated. Intubation is when a tube is placed, via the mouth, down into the lungs to provide oxygen to the body. Intubation will also require sedation for your dog, so the tube stays in position.
"
"If the dog is severely affected, and especially if they are having trouble breathing, a chest tube might be needed to drain the blood accumulation. This tube is placed in your dog’s chest under anesthesia or heavy sedation.
"
"An IV catheter will need to be placed so your dog can get both the medications they need for the symptoms they have and supportive fluids for hydration and a healthy blood pressure. Pain medications are also an important part of treatment. Depending on the severity of your dog’s pulmonary contusions, they might even need to be put on a ventilator to assist them with breathing.
"
"Even in mild cases of pulmonary contusion, your dog will likely need to spend some time under strict cage rest to allow them to recover from their contusions as well as any other injuries they sustained from the trauma. In dogs that have injuries such as broken bones or air buildup in the chest, surgery may be necessary.
"
"After being stabilized and hospitalized until they are breathing normally, your dog will be able to go home to continue recovering with strict rest and any needed medications, such as pain medication, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatories.
"
"Pulmonary contusions usually get worse before they get better. Respiratory issues often get worse 24–48 hours after the trauma, but then hopefully begin to improve. Although your dog might be feeling much better, pulmonary contusions typically take seven to 10 days to fully resolve. That’s why  your dog needs to be on strict cage rest for a few weeks after their injury.
"
"If your dog has sustained a blunt injury to the chest and has not developed any signs of troubled breathing after 48 hours, they are unlikely to develop any. Dogs that do not have other bodily injuries will have a better prognosis than those with secondary issues such as rib fractures or damage to other organs.
"
"If your dog has trouble breathing or they need to be temporarily intubated or put on a ventilator, their prognosis is less favorable for a complete recovery.
"
"After pulmonary contusions, your dog might have a compromised respiratory system, meaning you should be cautious with their exercise and other activities that put excess strain on the lungs. In a case like this, and depending on the severity of their injuries, a dog might need to be on lifelong medications to help keep the airway open as well as to manage pain.
"
"The survival rate depends greatly on the severity of the injuries sustained. One study showed that three out of 10 dogs with severe pulmonary contusions survived.
"
"Pulmonary contusions usually get worse before they get better. Respiratory issues often get worse 24–48 hours after the trauma, but hopefully they will begin to improve within three to five days of the injury. Although your dog might be feeling much better, pulmonary contusions typically take seven to 10 days to fully resolve, hence the need to have your dog on strict cage rest for a few weeks after their injury.

"
"There is no cure for pulmonic stenosis, but balloon valvuloplasty can help manage and improve the condition.  Some dogs may also be treated with beta blockers (such as atenolol). 
"
"Prognosis is largely dependent on the severity of the obstructions. Dogs with mild or moderate stenosis may not need treatment and can have a normal lifespan. Dogs with moderate stenosis will likely need balloon dilation and may show signs of exercise intolerance and fainting. In severe cases, even after treatment, some dogs will need to be on medication for the rest of their life. Moderate exercise restriction is very important. Follow all instructions given by your veterinarian and veterinary cardiologist.
"
"Since there could be a hereditary component, breeding is generally not recommended. 
"
"Prognosis is variable depending on the severity. In dogs that have developed right-sided congestive heart failure or an irregular heartbeat, such as atrial fibrillation, prognosis is guarded to poor. However, in mild or moderate stenosis, some dogs can live a normal life without treatment, while others may need treatment and/or beta blockers. 
"
"In general, the price for this procedure can range from $4,000–$7,000.

"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is when high blood pressure develops in the dog’s lungs. It occurs more frequently in older, smaller-breed dogs, and can be fatal if not properly treated. Fortunately, this complex syndrome is not very common. While it can be caused by a genetic condition, it is more often a secondary disease that results due to multiple underlying conditions.
"
"The lungs have an intricate network of blood vessels that are like branches in a tree. You start with the big branches, like the pulmonary artery, and where the branches get the thinnest, they turn into twigs—these are the capillaries. The capillaries are where the smallest arteries connect with the smallest veins. The capillaries are where fluids and gasses are exchanged between lung tissue and blood vessels. Unoxygenated blood from the body is oxygenated in these tiny vessels in the lungs. Dogs with  pulmonary hypertension have too much pressure in these blood vessels, which leads to an enlargement of the heart, less oxygen in the bloodstream, and potentially heart failure.
"
"Pulmonary hypertension is increased blood pressure in the lungs, while systemic hypertension is increased blood pressure in arteries throughout the rest of the body.
"
"Systemic hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is much more common and affects the entire body. It is readily diagnosed with a blood pressure cuff, whereas pulmonary hypertension only affects the blood pressure in vessels inside the lungs themselves. It requires more advanced imaging to diagnose.
"
"Exercise intolerance
"
"Cough
"
"Fainting
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Rapid breathing
"
"Abdomen distension
"
"Cyanotic (blue-tinted) gums
"
"Lethargy
"
"Weight loss
"
"Sudden death
"
"Pulmonary hypertension is more commonly a secondary condition that arises as a consequence of an untreated underlying disease. For example, underlying diseases like heartworm disease and pulmonary thromboembolic (PTE) disease can lead to pulmonary hypertension by an obstruction. The pulmonary arteries can become blocked by the presence of worms, a clot, or a tumor, leading to increased blood pressure inside the lungs.
"
"There are many other systemic diseases such as Cushing’s disease, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA), protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) or nephropathy (PLN), trauma, or sepsis that can also result in dogs being more likely to have blood clots that lead to pulmonary hypertension.
"
"Chronic underlying lung disease like pulmonary fibrosis, bronchitis, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can also lead to an increase in pressure inside the lungs. This pressure increase is the result of the buildup of scar tissue inside the lungs, which narrows the vessels and capillaries. West Highland White Terriers are more predisposed to developing this form of pulmonary hypertension.
"
"Primary heart diseases that affect the right side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease or dilated cardiomyopathy can lead to poor functionality of the heart and subsequent increased blood pressure inside the lungs.
"
"Finally, pulmonary hypertension can be caused by congenital shunts in the heart that a dog is born with, or from a disease that is idiopathic—not linked to any underlying cause.
"
"If pulmonary hypertension is suspected based on a history of exercise intolerance, cough, difficulty breathing, or fainting, your dog’s primary veterinarian will want to start with a thorough physical examination. Sometimes a veterinarian may detect an extra heart sound that is unusual while listening to a dog's heart, called a split S2 sound. Your vet may also detect fluid in the belly (ascites) on palpation, rough lung sounds, or even cyanosis (a blue tint) of the gums.
"
"If your dog’s veterinarian suspects pulmonary hypertension, they will likely want to run lab work to screen for underlying disease and take x-rays of the heart. Bloodwork, a urinalysis, and a heartworm test are all recommended to screen for primary diseases that may have led to pulmonary hypertension.
"
"More advanced testing may also be recommended.
"
"Your regular vet will likely refer your dog to a veterinary cardiologist for a confirmed diagnosis of PH. The easiest and least invasive way to diagnose pulmonary hypertension is through an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the heart. Occasionally, cardiologists may elect to perform a right heart catheterization where a long wire is inserted into the jugular vein and threaded to the heart and into the pulmonary artery to get a pressure reading. This is a more invasive test and thus less commonly performed.
"
"Patients with pulmonary hypertension are often staged by determining which functional class they belong to. This classification system helps pet parents understand the severity of their dog’s pulmonary hypertension, and helps guide their veterinarians on when to institute treatment and which treatment may be best for management of the disease. The lower the stage number, the less severely the dog is affected.
"
"Functional Class 1: This class includes dogs with pulmonary hypertension that do not have any issues with physical activity and can exercise without any immediate troubles. These dogs can still run, jump, and play without showing any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or fainting.
"
"Functional Class 2: This class includes dogs that are normal while at rest but have some clinical signs of pulmonary hypertension when exercising, such as difficulty breathing, fatigue, or fainting.
"
"Functional Class 3: This class includes dogs that cannot exercise or even do mild activity without difficulty breathing, fatigue, chest pain, or even collapse.
"
"Functional Class 4: This class includes dogs that are symptomatic even when at rest.
"
"Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is geared toward reducing clinical signs, like exercise intolerance, cough, difficulty breathing, and fainting. Several medications are beneficial for pets with PH, including sildenafil and tadalafil (Cialis), which work to dilate the arteries inside the lungs to reduce arterial pressure.
"
"In many pets with pulmonary hypertension, heart disease is also present. Medications will likely be started to slow progression of your dog’s heart disease, like pimobendan (Vetmedin) and/or enalapril. If a dog is diagnosed with PH due to heart failure, they may have to be hospitalized and kept on oxygen until they are stable. If they are in heart failure, they may be put on medications that remove fluid that has backed up on the lungs, to help make your dog more comfortable.
"
"Medications like furosemide (Lasix) or spironolactone may be prescribed. If your dog is started on one of these diuretics, regular blood work is recommended to ensure the kidneys are tolerating the medication. You may notice your dog drinking and urinating more frequently while on these medications.
"
"Dogs with underlying lung disease may be put on theophylline, a bronchodilator, or anti-inflammatory drugs like steroids or non-steroidal agents, to open up the airways and help patients to be more comfortable when breathing.
"
"Other underlying diseases like Cushing’s, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, and protein-losing nephropathy or enteropathy may require additional medications to get under control. Unfortunately, most of these diseases are not readily cured, and are instead managed with medications and follow-up visits to adjust dosages.
"
"Pulmonary hypertension is not something that is cured, but rather is a diagnosis that is managed long-term with medications. After your pet is diagnosed and started on treatment, it is important to minimize their stress as much as possible. Your veterinarian may also recommend that you limit their activity to avoid excess work by the heart and lungs. Avoiding conditions that are hard on the lungs, such as high altitudes or excessively hot or cold air, and reducing exposure to cigarette smoke may also be helpful. Your veterinarian may recommend a prescription diet if your dog also has heart disease.
"
"Prevention of pulmonary hypertension is aimed at protecting pets from preventable disease or catching underlying disease early on. For example, regular heartworm prevention can keep your pet safe from heartworms. Bringing your pet in to see their veterinarian every year for regular checkups can also help to quickly identify any genetic or acquired medical conditions like heart disease or Cushing’s, so that prompt diagnosis and management can be instituted prior to developing secondary pulmonary hypertension.
"
"The prognosis for pulmonary hypertension depends on the severity of clinical signs and how well your dog responds to medications. Dogs with severe (Class 4) pulmonary hypertension may live only a few days or weeks. However, some dogs with less severe PH may live months or years with careful monitoring and treatment.

"Amyloidosis refers to a group of disorders that share a common feature: the pathologic abnormal deposition of a fibrous protein called amyloid into various tissues of the body.
"
"Hepatic amyloidosis is the deposition of amyloid in the liver. The accumulation of amyloid  often occurs secondary to an underlying inflammatory or lympho-proliferative disorder. For example, when lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, are produced in excessive quantities, amyloidosis can be a reaction to this condition. Or, it can occur as a familial disorder. Most affected dogs are thought to have reactive or secondary amyloidosis affiliated with an underlying primary inflammatory disorder. Familial amyloidosis has been described in certain dog breeds. The most commonly affected breeds are beagles, shar peis, and foxhounds.
"
"Multiple organs are commonly involved. Clinical signs are usually associated with renal (kidney) involvement. Or it may be associated with high liver enzymes, severe enlargement of the liver, coagulation disorders, liver rupture leading to hemoabdomen (blood in the abdomen), and/or liver failure. Liver amyloid accumulation is often insidious.
"
"Certain Chinese shar-pei dogs with cyclic fevers (known as shar-pei fever syndrome), Akitas with cyclic fever and multiple joint inflammations, and collies with “gray collie syndrome” are predisposed to developing amyloidosis. They usually develop renal signs first although some develop symptoms of liver failure first.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being primarily affected. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. These basic fluid tests are essential diagnostic tools for ruling out other causes of disease. The complete blood count will show any anemia which might be present due to internal bleeding or long-term disease, or it may indicate infection. The blood chemical profile may show kidney and liver abnormalities, and the urinalysis may show renal disease.
"
"A clotting profile should also be performed on a blood sample to check the liver’s functionality.  X-ray and ultrasound imaging may also reveal abnormalities in organs where amyloid might be collecting. If necessary, a minor surgery can also be performed to collect a sample for biopsy of the liver and/or other organs.
"
"Dogs with swelling in the joints should have joint taps taken. Cytology – a microscopic examination of the cells present in the fluid - of these samples can be performed to confirm or rule out the presence of malignancies in the cells. The composition of any fluid that has built up in the abdomen can also be analyzed at the laboratory.
"
"Prostatic cysts in the dog have several associations: changes in the cells brought on by hormonal changes; retention cysts within the prostate that are cavitating (capable of forming a cavity in the tissue or organ); fluid-filled lesions with a distinct capsule (sac-like enclosure); and paraprostatic (close to the prostate) cysts that are cavitating, fluid-filled lesions with a distinct capsule. Prostatic cysts range in diameter from a few millimeters to more than 20 centimeters. Paraprostatic cysts usually arise on top and alongside the prostate, displacing the bladder, or at the back of the prostate in the pelvis. These cysts affect intact male dogs between the ages of two and twelve years, with large dogs more commonly affected than small dogs.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Several ailments could account for these symptoms, and several diagnostic procedures will be used to determine exactly what is causing them in your dog. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Fluid from the prostate will be gathered, either by ejaculation, or by prostatic massage, in order to test the fluid for infection. Ultrasound will be used as a visual aid for guiding a fine-needle to the prostrate in order to draw fluid from any cysts. This process is referred to as fine needle aspiration.
"
"
"
"Cysts within the prostate may be treated with medications; however, your veterinarian may recommend castration as a way of resolving the condition and preventing future occurrences. Large cysts may need to be drained with ultrasound guidance prior to medication, while some cysts may need to be removed surgically.
"
"Following treatment, your veterinarian will want to check on the progress of the cysts by examining the prostrate, using ultrasound or x-ray imaging. After the initial treatment, your doctor will evaluate the size of the cysts at four week intervals.

"There is no cure for amyloidosis, but supportive care is very helpful. Blood transfusions should be administered if your dog has recently lost a lot of blood, and fluid therapy and possible diet changes will need to be undertaken. Each patient should have its diet tailored to suit the organ function that is being affected most. Surgery intervention may be necessary if there is a fractured liver lobe,.
"
"This syndrome is difficult to treat and has a guarded to poor prognosis. Most animals will have episodes of fever and cholestasis, where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum (small intestine).  Some dogs will benefit from medication, with resolved clinical signs and diminished hepatic amyloid. Shar-peis may survive more than two years. However, Akitas with cyclic clinical signs have a grave prognosis. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you for your dog as is necessary to monitor its organ function.

"Amyloidosis is a condition in which a waxy translucent substance – consisting primarily of protein – deposits in a dog's organs and tissues, compromising normal functions. This substance is referred to as amyloid. Prolonged excess of this condition may lead to organ failure. The kidney and liver are the most commonly affected, but amyloid deposition can also take place in other organs as well and can have multiple causes. There is some disagreement as to whether amyloid causes the diseased condition or whether it is deposited in the organs as the result of a preexisting diseased condition.
"
"In dogs clinical symptoms are usually related to amyloid deposition in the kidneys. No genetic involvement has been established but familial amyloidosis is known to occur in Chinese shar-peis, beagles, and English foxhound. The breeds predisposed to this disease are: Chinese shar-pei, beagles, collies, English foxhounds, pointers, and walker hounds. Dogs over the age of five and female dogs are at a slightly higher risk compared to males.
"
"As amyloid can deposit in various organs, the symptoms may vary in relation to the organ in which the amyloid has been deposited. Symptoms will also vary by the amount of amyloid deposited, and the reaction of the organ to the amyloid deposition. In dogs, the most common organ in which amyloid deposition is seen is the kidney. However, in Chinese shar-peis, the liver may also be involved. Following are some of the symptoms seen in dogs affected with amyloidosis:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will conduct a detailed physical examination, including a blood profile, chemical blood profile, complete blood count, and a urinalysis. These tests may provide information about organ function and give important information about complications that are occurring due to this disease. Urine tests are important if kidneys are being affected by amyloid deposition. Your veterinarian will also take X-ray images and use ultrasound to determine the structural features of the kidneys and where any abnormalities lay. In most cases a diagnosis is confirmed by examining tissue that has been collected during a kidney biopsy.
"
"
"
"If your dog has a chronic kidney problem and is experiencing kidney failure, your veterinarian will advise admission to the hospital to resolve the dehydration and stabilize the dog. If an underlying cause is found to be responsible, it will be treated accordingly. Patients in kidney failure required extensive medical treatment and management for a long period of time. Your veterinarian will devise a therapy plan for your dog and will prescribe medications according to the severity of the disease and the presence of other diseases or complications.
"
"This disease is progressive in nature and may require a long period of treatment. Most animals will return to normal activity but may need to be kept on a specific food diet that has been recommended by your veterinarian, especially if the kidneys are involved. Do not give any medications to your dog without first consulting your veterinarian, as most drugs need normal kidney functions in order to be excreted from the body. Because this condition is suspected of having a familial association, do not breed the affected animals because it can pass the trait on to future generations.

"An abscess of the prostate is evidenced by a pus filled sac that may lead to prostatitis, which is an inflammation of the prostate. This is often the result of a long-standing infection that has gone undetected. Prostatitis is divided into two phases: acute (early), and chronic (later, farther into the disease).
"
"Acute prostatitis occurs with the sudden onset of a bacterial infection in the prostate. Occasionally, the abscess may rupture and its contents will spill into the abdominal cavity.
"
"Chronic prostatitis occurs when a long-standing infection has gone undetected. Acute prostatitis may also lead to chronic prostatitis, with the initial symptoms being missed.
"
"Sudden (Acute) Prostatitis
"
"Long-Term (Chronic) Prostatitis
"
"All male dogs are at risk for sustaining prostatitis; there are no breeds that are exempt of more prone than others. However, dogs between the ages of 7 to 11 years are at higher risk. Some of the risk factors for this condition are:
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health and medical history, details of the onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to the leading cause of the condition. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including standard laboratory tests like a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. This is the only way to determine whether the organs are functioning properly, and to find factors such as bacterial infections, microscopic evidence of blood in the urine, or increased white blood cell counts, indicative of the body fighting an infection.
"
"There may be blood in the urine. In dogs with prostatitis, they may bleed even when not urinating. Sometimes an affected dog will not urinate at all, or will show pain while urinating. Feces may also appear flat and/or the dog may be constipated.
"
"During the physical exam, your veterinarian will insert a gloved finger into your dog's rectum to palpate the prostate gland. If your dog reacts painfully, and/or the prostate feels enlarged, biopsies will need to be taken for a histopathology, cytology and culture, and sensitivity testing.
"
"
"
"If the cause of the prostatitis is bacterial, your dog will need to be hospitalized and given antibiotics intravenously. Your dog may be treated on an outpatient basis if it is only suffering from a mild case of chronic prostatitis.
"
"Castration can relieve prostatitis if it is hormonal in origin, as dogs that have not been neutered are more prone to this type of disease. Your veterinarian may also prescribe hormone-blocking medications to lessen the chance of a recurrence.
"
"If your dog is suffering from a ruptured, abscessed prostate, it might require surgery once the antibiotic therapy has stabilized its condition.
"
"Unless your dog has a prostatic abscess which has ruptured into the abdominal cavity, its prognosis for recovery is still good to excellent. If your dog is able to remain whole (i.e., not neutered), you will need to prevent it from mating until it has recovered from the bacterial prostatitis and until no more bacteria are present in the prostatic fluid samples. These samples will be taken for laboratory examination during the follow-up visits with your veterinarian.
"
"If your veterinarian advises you to have your dog castrated in order to prevent a recurrence of prostatitis, its overall prognosis will greatly improve as a result. If your dog appears to have difficulty urinating again, is walking with a painful gait, or is exhibiting other symptoms it had during the bout with prostatitis, immediately contact your veterinarian, as the prostatitis may be recurring.

"The prostate gland is an essential part of the male reproductive system, secreting a liquid that contains simple sugars, citric acid, calcium, and a number of enzymes that work to balance out and protect the seminal fluid, aiding in its motility and survival so that it can fertilize a viable egg.

"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common age-related problem in dogs. Hyperplasia, as a medical condition, is the indicative term used to describe an abnormal growth in the number of cells in any organ. In this case, the prostate gland. When the condition is of a benign nature, enlargement of the prostate gland does not cause pain in the dog.
"
"This condition is commonly seen in intact dogs around 1-2 years of age. Incidence typically increases with age, affecting an estimated 95 percent of dogs by the time they reach nine years of age.

"
"Laboratory tests will commonly return positive results of blood in the urine. Pus or bacteria may be also present if an infection is present. Your veterinarian will take a sample of prostatic fluid through ejaculation or by prostatic massage which may show the presence of blood. Further diagnostic testing will include X-ray and ultrasonography imaging, which will help your veterinarian to determine the size of the prostate gland, and to estimate how the size of the prostate is affecting your dog. Using the ultrasound as a guide, samples can also be collected directly from prostate gland for analysis.
"
"
"
"In most cases no treatment is required. Castration is the best method for treat this condition – both to avoid recurrence and to prevent conditions which might encourage a carcinoma to develop. In those cases in which castration is not feasible, there may be some medicines that your veterinarian can use to shrink the enlarged prostate gland. However, recurrence may still occur after medical therapy.

"The prostate of a male dog is a gland that envelops their urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body. The gland is situated near the start of the urethra after it exits the bladder. Like its function in human males, the prostate in male dogs develops most of the fluid component in semen.
"
"A prostate may become enlarged due to infection, masses, or other causes. When this occurs, the dog may develop other problems due to the prostate’s proximity to important anatomical structures like the urethra, bladder, and rectum.
"
"The enlarged prostate can compress the urethra, which can make urination difficult. If the prostate is large enough to put pressure on the rectum, the dog may strain to defecate. In unneutered dogs, prostate enlargement has repercussions for fertility.
"
"Not all causes of prostate enlargement are linked to cancer. The most common cause of an enlarged prostate is benign, meaning it’s not cancerous.

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Straining to urinate or defecate
"
"Frequent urination
"
"Blood in urine
"
"Increased drinking
"
"Pain in the abdomen, which may cause the dog to vocalize when pressure is placed on the abdomen
"
"Several conditions cause prostate enlargement in dogs, including: benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatic infections (prostatitis), and prostate cancer.
"
"Hyperplasia is the enlargement of an organ or tissue caused by increased replication of cells. With benign prostatic hyperplasia, male hormones cause increased production of cells, which results in prostate enlargement.
"
"While BPH is considered a normal age-related change in intact male dogs, it can cause issues for the dog if the prostate becomes too large or if the prostate develops cysts. Prostatic cysts can lead to infection of the prostate.
"
"Benign prostatic hyperplasia is the most common cause of prostate enlargement in male dogs who have not been neutered. Breeds with an increased risk of BPH include Scottish Terriers, German Shepherds, and Doberman Pinschers.
"
"Prostate infection usually occurs due to bacteria that make their way to the prostate through the urethra. The risk of developing prostatitis is increased in older unneutered male dogs with BPH. Large-breed dogs are more predisposed to prostate infection than small-breed dogs.
"
"Prostate cancer can develop in both neutered and unneutered dogs. Dogs are typically older at the time of diagnosis, with most diagnoses occurring between 8.5 and 11 years of age. Breeds predisposed to prostate cancer include:
"
"Bouvier des Flandres
"
"Doberman Pinschers
"
"Shetland Sheepdogs
"
"Scottish Terriers
"
"Beagles
"
"Miniature Poodles
"
"German Shorthaired Pointers
"
"Airedale Terriers
"
"Norwegian Elkhounds
"
"Based on the clinical signs your dog has been exhibiting, your veterinarian will begin with a physical exam. This will include palpating (examining by touch) the abdomen and performing a rectal exam to feel the prostate.
"
"Your veterinarian will run bloodwork to look at your pet’s overall health. Examining the pet’s urine and culturing it for bacteria may also help determine if your pet has a prostate infection.
"
"X-rays and ultrasound of the abdomen allow the veterinarian to further examine the size and shape of the prostate, as well as to see if there are cysts present.
"
"In some cases, particularly if there is concern of prostate infection and the dog isn’t neutered, the veterinarian may want to perform an evaluation of the pet’s semen to look for evidence of infection or to culture for bacteria.
"
"For a definitive diagnosis, the veterinarian may collect a sample of cells from the prostate. Some veterinarians prefer to do this with a needle and ultrasound guidance, while others prefer a biopsy obtained surgically.
"
"If cancer is suspected, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be recommended to monitor spread of the cancer and plan treatment.
"
"Treatment depends on the underlying cause of prostate enlargement.
"
"For dogs with BPH, having your dog neutered is the first-choice treatment. The prostate inflammation will reduce by more than 50% within three weeks and more than 70% in nine weeks. For breeding dogs or dogs for whom anesthesia is a significant risk, treatment with oral medicines like finasteride can be given long-term to manage the condition.
"
"For dogs with a prostate infection, the use of antibiotics should be based on urine culture results. In some dogs with an enlarged prostate, especially those who developed an infection secondary to BPH, neutering may be recommended. Antibiotics for a prostate infection are given for at least four to six weeks. Common choices include enrofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfonamide (TMS), clindamycin, and erythromycin.
"
"Prostate cancer has at least an 80% chance of spreading (metastasizing) to other parts of the body. Because of this, most pet parents prioritize quality of life over aggressive treatment. Animals who have evidence of metastases or advanced disease at the time of diagnosis are not good candidates for curative treatments.
"
"Treatment options for prostate cancer in dogs include:
"
"Oral medications like piroxicam that reduce inflammation and slow tumor growth
"
"Chemotherapy
"
"Radiation therapy
"
"Surgery to remove part of or the entire prostate
"
"Some treatments simply focus on relieving obstructions. Specialty hospitals may be able to place a stent in the urethra to help the dog urinate. Stool softeners like lactulose or polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX®) are often prescribed to help with constipation.
"
"Recovery and management also depend on the underlying cause and severity of the disease.
"
"For dogs with symptoms of prostate enlargement due to BPH, neutering is curative. Your dog should recover within a few weeks.
"
"Dogs with a prostate infection that came on suddenly usually have successful antibiotic treatment without neutering, while dogs with chronic infection of their prostate usually need to be neutered to completely resolve their signs.
"
"Treatment for a prostate infection lasts one to two months. Dogs that have a fever and other symptoms may need to be hospitalized short-term for supportive care. Supportive care would include intravenous (IV) fluids, nutritional management, pain medications, and possibly a urinary catheter to ensure urine can drain. Your pet may receive their antibiotics and other medications through an IV catheter.
"
"Dogs with advanced prostate cancer that do not receive treatment are typically humanely euthanized within a month, due to the severity of the disease. Dogs treated with oral medications, radiation, and/or chemotherapy have a prognosis closer to seven months.
"
"Surgery is not typically pursued for dogs with prostate cancer. Management is focused on comfort, pain relief, and ensuring that they can urinate and defecate.
"
"In most cases, prostate enlargement isn’t a medical emergency. However, if your dog is vomiting, unable to urinate, and/or sluggish, seek emergency attention for your pet. Failure to urinate can result in kidney disease, which can be fatal.
"
"Removal of a dog’s prostate is not routinely done due to the aggressive nature of prostate cancer and the high risk of complications (especially urinary incontinence) from the procedure. When performed, removal of the prostate is typically done by a specialist and can cost over $2,000. Keep in mind that because most prostate tumors spread, chemotherapy is usually recommended in addition to surgery, potentially adding anywhere from $3,000–$10,000 to the costs, depending on the protocol used and how well your pet responds.

"The prostate gland is located near the neck of the bladder in male dogs, close to where the urethra exits the bladder. The urethra passes through the prostate gland after exiting the bladder. The canine prostate gland produces some of the fluid found in semen.  
"
"Cancer of the prostate occurs when the cells of the prostate gland grow out of control. The most common type of prostate cancer in dogs is adenocarcinoma. The age of the average dog at diagnosis is 10 years old. Like human men, aging dogs can also have a benign (harmless) enlargement of the prostate. Prostatic cancer in general in dogs is rare. 
"
"The exact cause for this cancer is unknown, but there are certain risk factors such as the dog’s environment and genetics that may play a role.  
"
"Like other types of adenocarcinomas, prostatic adenocarcinoma is highly metastatic, meaning it easily spreads to other parts of the body. In fact, prostatic adenocarcinoma spreads in more than 85% of dogs that develop this type of cancer.  
"
"Common sites for the spread of prostatic adenocarcinoma include: 
"
"Other parts of the urinary tract  
"
"Lymph nodes  
"
"Lungs  
"
"Abdominal organs such as liver and spleen  
"
"Bone 
"
"Uncommon (but reported) sites of spread also include the brain and spinal cord. 
"
"The most common symptoms of prostate cancer in dogs are related to the urinary tract. As the prostate enlarges, it compresses the urethra, which leads to abnormal urinary habits such as straining to urinate, frequent urination with only small amounts of urine produced at a time, blood in the urine, and the complete inability to urinate.  
"
"Symptoms of prostatic adenocarcinoma, however, may not be limited to just the urinary tract. If the cancer spreads, other organs can be affected. The mass may invade into the bladder, which can cause further bleeding, infection, and trouble urinating. Potential damage to the kidneys can occur if a ureter (the tube that transports urine from the kidneys to the bladder) becomes obstructed.  
"
"If the prostatic mass is very large, there may be compression of the colon. This can lead to straining to defecate and abnormal-appearing stools.  
"
"This type of cancer readily spreads to other nearby organs, including:  
"
"Lungs: May cause coughing, abnormal breathing, potential fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. 
"
"Bones: May cause lameness at the site of spread. This can be characterized by a limp in the specific limb, or possibly both hind limbs if the pelvis is the site of spread. 
"
"Brain or spinal cord: May result in neurological dysfunction, such as the inability to walk and abnormal behavior. 
"
"The exact cause for development of cancer in the canine prostate has not been identified, but both intact and castrated male dogs can develop prostatic adenocarcinoma.  
"
"A few risk factors such as environment and genetics may have a link to development of prostatic adenocarcinoma, but the exact cause is unknown. A potential link between neutering too early in life and the increased risk of development of prostatic adenocarcinoma has been found. 
"
"Diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma will be made with a combination of clinical signs, a thorough physical exam, and diagnostics.  
"
"The first screening tests will include blood work and a urinalysis. Blood work may show signs of anemia (low red blood cell count) and infection or inflammation (high white blood cell count). The urine will be checked for abnormalities such as evidence of blood, bacteria, inflammation, or cancerous cells. 
"
"As prostatic carcinoma is very metastatic, radiographs (x-rays) of the abdomen and chest will be performed. A radiograph of the abdomen may show an enlarged prostate or possible mineralization of the prostate. The bony structures of the pelvis and spine will be evaluated for possible signs of metastasis.  
"
"Because the lungs are a very common place for spread, chest radiographs will most likely be obtained. Chest radiographs may show nodules within the lungs. 
"
"Advanced diagnostics, such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, may also be performed. An abdominal ultrasound will allow for a more detailed examination of the prostate and the nearby lymph nodes, as well as the rest of the urinary tract and remaining abdominal organs.  
"
"A CT scan may be performed less commonly but can allow for very detailed information on the prostate and possible sites of metastasis. 
"
"Cytological (cell) samples can also aid in the diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma. Samples may be obtained by catheterization, prostatic wash, or fine needle aspiration. 
"
"If caught very early in the disease process, before metastasis has occurred, surgical removal of the diseased portion of the prostate may be considered. Surgery is often followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy.  
"
"If metastasis has already occurred, then palliative care should be considered. The goal of palliative care is to relieve pain and any clinical symptoms that may be present, while also trying to improve your dog’s quality of life for as long as possible.  
"
"If a urinary obstruction is present, a small tube called a stent may be placed within the urethra to keep it open so the dog can urinate. Surgery of the prostate is not often performed when advanced disease is present because of the high risk of complications. Radiation therapy may be considered in certain cases. 
"
"Your veterinarian may also recommend a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to relieve pain. Any urinary tract infection that may be present will be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Chemotherapy may be considered, but long-term efficacy has not been established.  
"
"If disease is detected early, before any spread has occurred, then more definitive treatment may be performed to extend survival time. Once the cancer has spread, management of clinical signs is often performed until the disease progresses too far to control.  
"
"Overall prognosis for prostatic adenocarcinoma is poor. Euthanasia may be required once quality of life has deteriorated or clinical signs cannot be controlled. 
"
"The average survival time after diagnosis varies depending on whether or not treatment is performed. As disease is often advanced once a diagnosis is made, survival time is very short. If no treatment is pursued, euthanasia is usually performed within a month of diagnosis. Depending on the treatment used, survival times average around 7 months after diagnosis.  
"
"Canine prostatic adenocarcinoma is very locally aggressive and has a very high metastatic rate. 
"
"Prostatic adenocarcinoma is not curable, but it may be successfully removed with surgery in some cases.

"Esophageal diverticula is characterized by large, pouch-like sacs on the esophageal wall. Pulsion diverticula is a pushing outward of the wall. This occurs as a consequence of increased pressure from within the esophagus, as seen with obstruction or failure of the esophageal muscles to move food through. Traction diverticula occurs secondary to inflammation, where fibrosis and contraction pull the wall of the esophagus out into a pouch. Diverticula most commonly occurs at the inlet to the esophagus or near the diaphragm, with food being taken into the mouth and getting caught in a pouch as it travels down the esophagus towards the stomach. Organ systems affected include the gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and respiratory. Although no genetic basis has been proven, it may be congenital (present at birth), or acquired. There is no specific breed or gender predisposition for this disease.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct an esophagram, or an esophagoscopy to examine the diverticula in order to determine whether there is a related mass. An X-ray of the chest area, and a fluoroscopal examination to evaluate the movement of food through the esophagus will give your doctor a better idea of where the diverticula is placed in the esophageal wall. An injection of a radiocontrasting agent into the esophageal passage may be used to improve visibility on an X-ray so that an exact determination can be made, as the substance flows down the esophagus, filling the pouches as is does.
"
"
"
"If the diverticulum is small and is not causing significant clinical signs, your veterinarian may only recommend a change in diet for you dog. A soft, bland diet, given frequently and followed by copious liquids, will most likely travel through the esophagus to the stomach unhindered. If the diverticulum is large, or is associated with significant clinical signs, surgical resection will probably be recommended. The potential for food being drawn into the lungs, and leading to aspiration pneumonia makes the importance of dietary management key to avoiding fatal complications. Aggressive care will be called for if aspiration pneumonia is present. Fluid therapy, antibiotics, and nutrition via tube will be necessary. Your veterinarian will prescribe medications for your dog on the basis of the diagnosis.
"
"Your doctor will want to monitor your dog for evidence and prevention of infection or aspiration pneumonia. You will need to maintain a positive nutritional balance throughout the disease process. Patients with diverticula and impaction (i.e., food material that is packed tightly) are predisposed to perforation, fistula, stricture, and postoperative rupturing of the incision. For this reason, your veterinarian will want to revisit your dog on a regular schedule. Prognosis is guarded in patients with large diverticula and overt clinical signs.

"The lens is a small, clear disc inside the eye that focuses light on the retina to help your dog see. It’s suspended in place by small ligaments called zonules. When these ligaments break down, it can cause the lens to fall or “luxate” out of its normal position.
"
"Lens luxation either can be the primary problem in the eye (called primary lens luxation), or it may occur secondary to another condition inside the eye (called secondary lens luxation).
"
"The lens can either fall forward or backward out of its normal position. When the lens falls forward, it is called anterior luxation. When it falls backward, it is called posterior luxation.
"
"It’s more serious when the lens falls forward in the eye, as anterior lens luxation can block the flow of normal fluid out of the eye. This causes pressure to build up and results in glaucoma, which is increased pressure inside the eye. Glaucoma is very painful in dogs. The building pressure can also lead to permanent blindness.
"
"Because of this risk, primary lens luxation in dogs is considered a medical emergency. While anterior lens luxation can be incredibly painful and may result in permanent vision loss, it’s not a fatal condition in dogs.

"Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a term used to describe a group of genetic disorders that eventually result in loss of vision for dogs. Although the time period can vary, many dogs will lose their sight entirely within 1-2 years of symptoms.
"
"PRA occurs when the rods and cones in the eye’s retina fail to develop shortly after birth (early onset PRA) or begin to atrophy when they are adults (late onset PRA). The retina is a thin layer of cells that lines the back of the eye; it converts light that enters the eye into a signal that can be transmitted to and interpreted by the brain. The cells that detect light in the retina are called photoreceptors.
"
"Rods are photoreceptors for black and white vision and help process movement. They work well in low light, which dogs rely on for night vision. Cones are photoreceptors for color vision and are important during well-lit conditions. 
"
"Dogs have many rods and fewer number of cones as compared to humans. This is why dogs can detect movement and see better in the dark but have poorer color vision than people.
"
"When PRA occurs, rods are often the first affected, followed by the cones. Pet parents often note the signs of PRA when their dogs seem to have trouble seeing in the dark.
"
"Although PRA can affect any breed or age of dog, several breeds have a higher risk. More is being learned about how genetic mutations affect different breeds. Losing vision is distressing, but PRA itself is not a painful process compared to other disorders that result in blindness. 
"
"Early-onset PRA is often referred to as retinal dysplasia and occurs in puppies around the time they are weaned (8-12 weeks of age). In these puppies, the rods and cones did not form properly, and they will quickly lose the ability to see. 
"
"Symptoms of primary lens luxation in dogs include:
"
"Tearing
"
"Squinting
"
"Haziness or cloudiness in the eye
"
"Pain
"
"Red discoloration of the eye
"
"Change in the pupil size or shape
"
"White spot in front of the iris (the colored part of the eye)
"
"Primary lens luxation occurs when there is weakness and breakdown of the ligaments that hold the lens in place due to an inherited condition, meaning it’s caused by genetics. Secondary lens luxation occurs following a problem within the eye, such as inflammation, glaucoma, cataracts, cancer, or trauma.
"
"Primary lens luxation more commonly occurs in young adulthood when affected dogs are between 3 and 8 years old. This condition is more common in:
"
"Jack Russell Terriers
"
"Bull Terriers
"
"Yorkshire Terriers
"
"Australian Cattle Dogs
"
"Border Collies
"
"Chinese Crested
"
"Chinese Shar-Pei
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Lens luxation is diagnosed following a complete eye exam, also called an ophthalmic exam. Your veterinarian will look inside your dog’s eye using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope.
"
"Other tests that may be run at your dog’s veterinary office include tonometry and Schirmer’s tear testing (STT).
"
"Tonometry involves using an instrument called a Tono-pen to check your dog’s eye pressure. Schirmer’s tear testing involves using tiny test strips to measure your dog’s tear production. You may be referred to a veterinary ophthalmologist for additional testing, such as an eye ultrasound, to examine the internal structures inside the eye and to discuss repair options.
"
"Share with your veterinarian if your dog has experienced any eye drainage, squinting, or changes in color, and when you first noticed these changes.
"
"Treatment of primary lens luxation is surgical. If caught early enough, your dog can have a lensectomy performed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. In this procedure, a small incision in the eye is made and the lens itself is removed. The incision is then stitched up with tiny sutures that will be absorbed over time.
"
"Dogs who have had this procedure are still able to see; however, they are farsighted without a lens.
"
"There are many possible complications following this surgery, including inflammation, glaucoma, and retinal detachment. Dogs will need lifelong medications post-operatively.
"
"Late-onset PRA occurs in adult dogs that are 3-9 years old and is a “true” atrophy—the rods and cones lose their ability to function and vision is lost. 
"
"Symptoms vary depending on the dog and how quickly the disease progresses. Some changes pet parents may notice include: 
"
"Reluctance to go outside at night or to enter a dark room. 
"
"Clumsiness and bumping into things (especially in dark rooms, new environments, or after furniture has been rearranged).
"
"Dilated pupils that slowly constrict in response to light.
"
"Eyes that are more reflective in the dark (the eyes may glow more than they used to when a picture is taken using flash).
"
"Cataracts, which may be the first sign pet parents notice.
"
"PRA is an inherited disorder in dogs with no successful treatment options. In most dogs, PRA is caused by an autosomal recessive trait, meaning that if a dog would have inherited a defective copy of the gene from both their mother and father. 
"
"In a few breeds of dogs, PRA is a dominant gene, meaning it occurs if they receive one defective copy of the gene. There are also some breeds with a gender-linked version of PRA in which male dogs are more commonly affected than females. 
"
"Several genetic disorders that lead to PRA have been identified and can be detected using genetic testing. However, some versions are not yet identified, so genetic testing with no evidence of PRA does not mean a dog will not be affected. 
"
"In dogs with PRA, typically the rods will start to atrophy and lose their ability to function first.  This will result in decreased ability to see in dark or dimly lit light.  Eventually, the cones will also atrophy. Once all the rods and cones have atrophied, vision is lost. 
"
"The time to onset of atrophy and how quickly atrophy occurs varies based on the genetic mutation, but most pets that are affected will be blind within 1-2 years after the onset of clinical signs. 
"
"Breeds at higher risk for early onset Progressive Retinal Atrophy/Retinal Dysplasia:
"
"American Staffordshire Terrier
"
"Bedlington Terrier
"
"Pit Bull Terrier
"
"Sealyham Terrier
"
"Belgian Malinois (Shepherd)
"
"Briard
"
"Cardigan Welsh Corgi
"
"Collie
"
"Irish Setter
"
"Mastiff
"
"Miniature Schnauzer
"
"Norwegian Elkhound
"
"Breeds at higher risk for late/adult-onset Progressive Retinal Atrophy: 
"
"Akita
"
"American Cocker Spaniel
"
"Australian Cattle Dog
"
"Alternatively, if having the lens removed by a veterinary ophthalmologist is not an option, the painful eye itself can be removed. This surgery is called an enucleation and can be done by your regular veterinarian.
"
"While anterior lens luxation can rapidly lead to glaucoma, pain, and blindness, posterior lens luxation is much less severe. Oftentimes, posterior lens luxation can be managed with topical medications aiming to keep the pupil constricted to prevent the lens from falling forward.
"
"Recovery from surgery usually entails a two-week period of very strict rest.
"
"Your dog may be kept at the veterinary hospital for a few days following the surgery. Once discharged and allowed to come home, it is important to keep their activity levels restricted. During all outdoor time, they should only be leash-walked. Utilize their kennel as much as necessary to prevent running, jumping, and going up or down stairs. A recovery cone will need to be worn to prevent any pawing at the face, and post-operative medications should be given as directed.
"
"If you are struggling to keep your dog’s activity level restricted, talk to your veterinarian about a mild sedative, such as trazodone, to see if it would be a good fit for your pup.
"
"Because primary lens luxation is an inherited condition, the focus of prevention lies on not breeding affected animals.
"
"However, most affected dogs do not have their lens luxate until they are around 3 years of age, and many breeding animals are selected earlier than that. Fortunately, there are genetic tests available to determine if your dog carries the most common gene associated with primary lens luxation, the ADAMST17 gene.
"
"If your dog has experienced primary lens luxation in one eye, it’s common for it to progress to the other eye. Scheduling regular complete eye exams for your dog can aid in early intervention to prevent rapid progression and vision loss in the other eye.
"
"The cost of removing the lens varies by region, but usually ranges between $1,500 and $4,000.

"Diagnosing PRA often involves examining the retina, using a tool called an indirect ophthalmoscope. This is an optical tool worn on the veterinarian’s head (or attached to eyeglasses) and used to view the back of the eye.
"
"The vet will look for changes in the retina and optic nerve. They may see increased reflection in the part of the eye that “glows” in photos when light hits the eyes. These changes can be subtle in some dogs and may require referral to a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist. Both eyes will be equally affected.
"
"Cataracts or other issues may prevent a vet from viewing the retina. In these cases, a special diagnostic procedure called an electroretinogram (ERG) can be used to evaluate the retinas’ ability to perceive light.
"
"Genetic tests using a blood sample may be performed to detect the presence of genetic mutations. 
"
"Sadly, PRA cannot be treated, and dogs with this condition will eventually lose their sight.  For this reason, dogs with PRA (and their parents and siblings) should not be bred.  Some veterinarians may recommend antioxidants or a supplement called Ocu-Glo when PRA is first diagnosed, although there are few studies to support their use. 
"
"If a dog develops cataracts, the cataracts are generally not treated because vision will not improve. In some instances, cataracts can lead to inflammation within the eye or glaucoma—these can be painful and special eyedrops may be prescribed. 
"
"Loss of vision in dogs will require some adjustments, but dogs rely heavily on other senses like their superior sense of smell and keen sense of hearing, and they can have an excellent quality of life despite being blind. Some things that may help dogs with decreased vision or blindness include:

"The prostate is the only accessory sex gland in the dog. In intact (non-neutered) dogs this gland  increases in size and weight with advancing age. This is the most common disorder of the prostate in dogs older than six years and is a normal occurrence of aging. It is not necessarily a life-threatening condition by itself, but can result in a dog being more susceptible to other disorders, along with making the dog very uncomfortable.
"
"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in dogs is a hormone mediated proliferation of cells that is commonly seen in dogs from middle age onward. This condition affects the glands and connective tissues of the prostate, causing swelling of the prostrate gland, which then presses against the rectum, making the canal smaller and defecation painful for the dog.
"
"BPH is due to an age-associated increase in estrogen in the prostate. The ratio between estrogen and androgen ratio is believed to contribute to BPH development in older dogs, as both estrogens and androgens are required for significant prostatic enlargement to occur.
"
"The clinical effects of BPH are minimal or absent in most dogs, but in chronic cases, BPH can render the prostate more susceptible to infection from the urinary tract and subsequent development of bacterial prostatitis.
"
"BPH incidence is high in non-neutered dogs. By five years of age, 50 percent of intact dogs exhibit histologic evidence of BPH. The true incidence of prostatis is unknown, but it’s considered common in veterinary practice. However. The incidence of neoplasia is low; carcinomas are reported at 0.29–0.60 in the dog population. Prostatic cysts in intact dogs generally occurs before four years of age. Cancer of the prostate generally occurs before ten years of age.
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Initially, standard laboratory tests will include a complete blood profile, chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Because there are so many possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.
"
"The doctor will thoroughly examine your dog and make some preliminary estimations based on the physical exam. However, the preferred method for looking at the prostate is by ultrasound, so the results of these images will provide much of the information your veterinarian needs to make a diagnosis. In addition, x-ray imaging can be used to gather information that is not revealed by the ultrasound. Culture samples from the urinary tract will be taken for analysis, as well as semen, and if a mass of tissue, or tumor, is found, your doctor may also perform a biopsy in order to define the mass.
"
"
"
"For benign prostatic hyperplasia, treatment is only indicated for symptomatic dogs. Castration is the treatment of choice for animals with no breeding value, and this should effectively resolve the problem.
"
"However, if the dog is valuable for breeding purposes, medications can be used to temporarily reduce the size of the prostate so that the dog can be functional. This treatment is typically only used to reduce clinical signs so that sufficient quantities of semen can be collected and frozen for future use. It is not meant as a long-term therapy, and without further treatment the prostate will return to pretreatment size eight weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Your veterinarian will likely recommend castration once the desired doses of semen are stored.
"
"If the cause is found to be a bacterial infection, antibiotics will be prescribed, based on the specific culture and sensitivity results. If the infection is chronic, the antibiotics of choice will be designed to treat the more intense form of infection. Castration is recommended if the course of antibiotics does not get resolve the infection. If the diagnosis is a cyst, treatment will be based on the location, type, and size of the cyst. Again, castration may be recommended.
"
"If the diagnosis is cancer, it has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy may be advisable, depending on the nature of the cancer, but it is important to keep in mind that there is no cure or long-term remedy for cancer. Pain relief medication will be prescribed to help your dog to cope.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to repeat the prostatic fluid cultures in follow-up visits. Semen evaluation should be performed in all dogs maintained for breeding, but not before 65 days after the resolution of bacterial prostatitis. The abdominal ultrasound will also need to be repeated in order to evaluate the prostate size after medical therapy.
"
"Dogs that test positive for Brucella (Gram-negative bacteria) should not be used for breeding, as this disease is highly infectious. It is also important to note that Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection that can be passed from dogs to humans, although is remains an uncommon disease in humans. In the event that your dog is diagnosed with Brucellosis,  you will need to take the necessary precautions when handling any secretions from your dog.

"The term ""pelvic bladder"" involves displacement of the bladder from its normal position and affected size and/or position of the urethra. This condition is usually seen in young intact female dogs with urination problems but some dogs with pelvic bladder don’t show urination problems.
"
"This condition is more common in dogs than cats presumably due to shorter size of urethra in dogs. In addition, it may occur in dogs of both sexes, either intact or neutered, although it is more common common in intact females less than year of age. In male dogs, it is usually detected after neutering.
"
"Some dogs may not exhibit any symptoms, while in others the following may be seen:
"
"Displacement of bladder from its normal position may be due to a congenital defect (birth defect). It is also thought to be caused by obesity in some dogs, and is generally associated with urologic abnormalities, aside from the obvious incontinence.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including background history of symptoms. After taking a complete history, your pet’s veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis will be conducted. If infection is suspected, your veterinarian will take the urine sample and will send it to a laboratory to culture and hopefully identify the causative organism. Urinalysis, meanwhile, may reveal urinary tract infection like presence of pus, blood, bacteria in urine.
"
"Other diagnostic procedures include abdominal X-rays and contrast cystourethrography. Radiographic examination of the urethra and urinary bladder after introduction of contrast medium may reveal a short, widened, or irregularly shaped urethra. Your veterinarian may also perform an ultrasound to examine kidneys and urinary bladder for stones, masses, distention of kidneys, and other abnormalities related to urinary system.
"
"
"
"In case of underlying urinary infections, your dog’s veterinarian will prescribe antibiotics to treat such infections. The dog will also require surgery to reposition the displaced bladder and urethra. On occasion, antidepressants are used to calm the animal.
"
"You may need to visit your pet’s veterinarian for follow-up examinations to evaluate progress of treatment and identify possible complications. In case of urinary infections, regular antibiotic medication is often required until the infection subsides. Watch your dog for untoward symptoms and call your veterinarian immediately if anything unusual arises. Your veterinarian will also brief you about the side-effects of medications commonly used in these cases.

"Some dogs are dangerous to other dogs, and even to humans, while they are eating. In fact, dogs can be aggressive in guarding everything they consider their possessions, such as food, bowls, items they steal or find, and toys. They are also very territorial and will defend any area they consider to be under their domain (e.g., the home).
"
"Is this aggression dangerous? Absolutely. However, this is normal behavior. Dogs are bred to protect, and at times it may be an issue of training and learned behavior. A secure fence is one solution but be aware that no fence is absolutely secure. In some dogs the behavior can be modified, but first you need to understand what the underlying cause is.
"
"There are times the dog develops the habit of defending food, objects, and territory by being aggressive because it has had successful results in the past. Other common causes include:
"
"Your veterinarian will first rule out any underlying diseases. If nothing is found to explain the behavior, they may refer you to an animal behaviorist who specializes in training dogs.
"
"
"
"You are probably not going to “cure” this aggressive dog, however, controlling the behavior is the goal. If the number of aggressive incidents can be decreased, you should feel that you have succeeded. A dog-training specialist can help you develop safety and management tools.
"
"Safety should be the primary concern. Avoid situations that may bring on an aggressive reaction. If your behaviorist recommends punishment/dominance-based training techniques, you may want to seek alternative help, as it may escalate aggression. There are better ways to deal with the problem.
"
"Feed the dog in a confined space and do not give it items that might incite aggressive behavior. Confine it to areas where people can neither be heard nor seen. Finally, teach your dog to wear a head halter and basket muzzle.
"
"In extreme cases, it may be necessary to put the dog down (euthanize), as it is sometimes the only way to assuredly prevent your dog from injuring others -- especially those that have already been involved in an incident or incidents.
"
"Behavior modification requires patience and consistency. It also takes time before the results are visible. In the presence of aggression-provoking stimuli, try desensitizing and counter-conditioning techniques. Use basket muzzles for safety when working with the dog.
"
"Teach it first to sit and relax on a verbal command. Do this in a neutral location and use food rewards in tiny pieces to avoid food aggression during these exercises; reward non-aggressive behavior also. Gradually increase the level of stimulation, being careful to stay below the threshold that will result in aggression. Remember, patience will be important, as progress is slow coming. Just when you think you’ve made a difference, there could be signs of a setback. It’s important to remain firm with the training exercises.
"
"While there are medications on the market for this behavioral disorder, they are not recommended. If your veterinarian does prescribe medication, it should only be utilized in association with behavior modification. It should never be utilized alone, as it will not solve the problem.

"Trichinosis (trichinellosis or trichiniasis) is a parasitic disease caused by a roundworm (nematode) parasite called Trichinella spiralis. T. spiralis is also known as “pork worm” because in most cases infection is seen due to eating contaminated raw or undercooked pork. This parasite is responsible for causing infection in dogs, people, and pigs.
"
"In the developing stage of this parasite's life cycle, infection occurs in dogs and people when they ingest contaminated, poorly cooked meat. The T. spiralis parasite is known to cause severe disease and even deaths in humans. Severe inflammation of the body muscles is seen as the parasite (larva) migrates into the muscles. Puppies are reported to be at higher risk of infection than adult dogs.
"
"Infection is caused by the roundworm parasite called T. spiralis, which enters the gastrointestinal system through contaminated raw meat. The developing stage of this parasite reaches into the muscles and is capable of remaining there for years.
"
"Your veterinarian will take detailed history from you, with attention on your dog's diet or anything your dog has eaten out of the ordinary. Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemical profile, urinalysis, and a fecal examination. The complete blood count may show a high number of a type of white blood cells (WBCs) called eosinophils (eosinophilia), which are typically found in the blood as a response to allergies or in response to parasitic infections. If the fecal sample shows evidence of roundworm fragments, a follow-up series of fecal testing may be required for confirmation of the diagnosis. As these parasites end up in the muscles, a muscle sample may be taken to find the parasite in the muscles.
"
"
"
"In case of mild disease, usually no treatment is required in the affected animal other than the use of roundworm specific antiparasitic drugs to reduce the number of parasites in the muscles.
"
"After the initial treatment, monitor your dog for ongoing muscle pains or any other untoward symptoms. Consult your veterinarian if any symptoms reappear in your dog. Prevention of this infection is achieved simply by not feeding your dog undercooked pork products and blocking access to waste that includes pork leftovers.

"Proptosis is the medical term when a dog’s eye is suddenly loosened from the eye socket and the eyelids trap the eye in the forward position. Proptosis is an emergency because as soon as the eye starts to dry out, it becomes susceptible to infection, and is at immediate risk of blindness as soon as it leaves the socket.
"
"This condition is most common in short-nosed dogs (brachycephalic breeds), whose eyes are naturally more exposed out of the eye socket compared to other dogs (Pugs, French Bulldogs). However, proptosis can occur in any dog that experiences head trauma.
"
"The following symptoms may occur with proptosis in dogs:
"
"Eye pushed forward out of the eye socket
"
"Whining, pawing at the eye, restlessness, attempts to bite
"
"Severely red eye
"
"Dry cornea, potentially with an ulcer
"
"Ruptured eye muscles
"
"Possible rupture of the optic nerve
"
"Potential presence of blood inside the eye
"
"Possible rupture of the eye (evidenced by a hole, deflation, or leakage)
"
"The primary cause of proptosis in dogs is trauma, often resulting from being hit by a car or engaging in a dog fight, which can cause head injuries, including skull fractures. Dogs that have previously had a proptosis are more susceptible to a recurrence, as the eye muscles that hold the eye in place may have been compromised.
"
"Short-nosed, or brachycephalic, dog breeds commonly have bulging eyes, which makes them at higher risk for proptosis. Additionally, excessive physical pressure applied to the neck or head, such as through scruffing (holding the dog by the scruff of their neck) or the use of a choke collar, can cause proptosis in short-nosed dogs.
"
"If your dog develops proptosis, get them to the vet as quickly as possible. The sooner your dog receives veterinary care, the better the chances of saving the eye.
"
"Your vet will examine your pet’s bulging eye and perform eye tests to determine the extent of the damage and other potential hidden injuries, depending on how the proptosis occurred. The examination will include checking light reflexes and eye pressure, as well as looking for signs of corneal injury.
"
"If the proptosis resulted from a traumatic event, your vet may recommend additional diagnostic tests, such as X-rays of the skull and chest, blood work, CT scans or MRIs, to screen for potential serious related injuries.
"
"When considering the best course of action for proptosis, it’s important to factor in the prognosis. Dogs with a better prognosis for vision after surgery are short-nosed dogs with minimal trauma, dogs that have normal eye reflexes, and dogs that received immediate treatment.
"
"There is a higher chance of chronic pain and blindness despite surgery if the dog has a ruptured eye, bleeding inside the eye, a rupture of three or more muscles that hold the eye in place, or nerve rupture. If your dog has these complications, your veterinarian may recommend surgically removing the eye.
"
"When the veterinarian recommends replacement of the eye, the surgery is referred to as either globe replacement or temporary tarsorrhaphy. Depending on the surgeon’s choice, the dog will be fully anesthetized or heavily sedated during the surgery. The surgical site area is shaved and surgically prepped, and the eye is carefully repositioned back in the socket. The eyelids are then sutured together to secure the eye in its proper place.
"
"In cases where the surgeon recommends removal of the eye, there are two options. 
"
"The first option is enucleation. Under anesthesia, the surgeon removes the eye and sutures the eyelid closed. This typically provides relief from pain very quickly after surgery. With this option, for the remainder of the dog’s life they will have the appearance of that eye being closed, and the area will look sunken.
"
"If the pet parent prefers to have a prosthetic eye placed, a referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist is required. Under anesthesia, the veterinary ophthalmologist will remove the internal contents of the eye and place a prosthesis, which is a black ball, inside the shell of the remaining eye.
"
"Although this artificial eye does not provide vision, there is still technically an eye and the eyelids can still open and close. The eye may look dark or cloudy after the procedure. While this procedure relieves the pain associated with proptosis, ongoing eye care, such as the use of eye drops, may be needed. Surgery would still be needed to properly position the artificial eye.
"
"For both types of eye removal surgery, the surgeon may prescribe an anti-inflammatory pain reliever along with optional antibiotics. Also, make sure your dog wears an e-cone or recovery collar throughout the entire recovery period to prevent any disturbance of the delicate stitches while they heal. When taking your dog on walks in the future, make sure to use a harness rather than a collar to minimize the risk of proptosis recurring.
"
"Following surgery, you may notice some swelling, bruising, and the seeping of red-tinged fluid at the incision site, which should decrease within a few days. However, if you see increased redness, swelling, bleeding, cloudy discharge, or more pain, reach out to your veterinarian.
"
"If the eye was put back in place, replaced, your dog may need frequent eye drops, including drops to keep the eye dilated, antibiotic drops, and, if necessary, drops for glaucoma. Expect a recheck appointment in a few days and another one in two to three weeks to have the stitches removed.
"
"If the eye was removed, you won’t need to give any eye drops. Expect a recheck appointment in 10–14 days for the removal of stitches.
"
"Pet parents of brachycephalic dogs need to be vigilant to prevent the following situations for their pets: accidents to the head, dog fights, and squeezing of the neck (such as scruffing, tight hugging, or the use of choke collars). These dogs should always wear a harness for walks, not a collar.
"
"For all dogs, regardless of breed, pet parents should do their best to prevent dog fights, head or eye trauma, and excessive strain on a choke collar.
"
"While a dog could survive with proptosis, the condition is extremely painful, and the dog’s quality of life would be poor.
"
"Because the eyelids fold back and prevent the eye from going back into the socket, proptosis never heals on its own. A dog with proptosis needs surgery as quickly as possible to correct this condition.

"Blood is made up of red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, and plasma (the liquid part). On average, the percentage of the RBC in blood is 35 to 55%. This is known as PCV, or packed cell volume.
"
"Polycythemia, erythrocytosis, and high red blood cell count are all used to describe the increase in RBC either in quantity, hemoglobin (protein that carries oxygen), or PCV.
"
"This increase in red blood cells causes them to collect on the walls of red blood vessels, also called sludging. This causes vessel damage, clot formation, and poor circulation. It also causes decreased blood flow to vital places like the brain, which leads to less oxygen and nutrients. When the brain doesn’t get enough oxygen, symptoms such as seizures and blindness in dogs can occur.
"
"Polycythemia in dogs is a very rare condition with only a few cases reported, and it often develops slowly. Some dogs are diagnosed after routine blood work and before the development of symptoms, and some dogs can remain asymptomatic for years.
"
"Spurious or relative polycythemia occurs when there is normal RBC mass but an increase in the PCV, often in cases of:
"
"Dehydration
"
"Strenuous exercise, excitement, or stress
"
"Severe pain
"
"Water deprivation
"
"Heatstroke
"
"Burns
"
"Excessive vomiting and diarrhea
"
"Absolute polycythemia occurs when there is an increase in the production of RBC and can be further classified as either:
"
"Primary, known as polycythemia vera, which occurs when there is cancer of the bone marrow.
"
"Secondary, which can occur during several conditions such as:
"
"Anemia (low red blood cell count)
"
"Low atmospheric oxygen (high altitude)
"
"Heart dysfunction, congenital heart defects, and clots
"
"Carbon monoxide poisoning
"
"Respiratory disease
"
"Kidney cancer and disease
"
"Symptoms of polycythemia in dogs are typically noticed when the PCV becomes greater than 65%. Signs can include:
"
"Lethargy and exercise intolerance
"
"Weakness
"
"Bright red gums
"
"Dehydration
"
"Bloodshot eyes
"
"Heart murmur
"
"Respiratory distress
"
"Increased thirst and urination
"
"Reddened skin
"
"Bleeding, which may show as bloody stool, black tarry stool (melena), vomiting blood, or nose bleeds
"
"Neurologic signs such as behavior changes, seizures, blindness, tremors, or lack of coordination
"
"Polycythemia in dogs has several causes, depending on the type.
"
"Polycythemia tends to occur more in middle-aged female dogs. Certain breeds, like Greyhounds, normally have high RBC concentrations to begin with, but this isn’t considered abnormal in the breed.
"
"Your vet will want a thorough history of your pet. Then they’ll perform a physical examination with bloodwork and a urinalysis to look for a high PCV, Hgb, and RBC count.
"
"Polycythemia in dogs is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that your veterinarian must rule out all other causes first. Additional blood tests, X-rays of the chest and abdomen, echocardiogram of the heart, serum EPO levels, and even a bone marrow aspirate may be recommended.
"
"Treatment of polycythemia in dogs varies and often depends on the underlying cause. For example, dogs with relative polycythemia need fluid therapy, and dogs with cancer would need surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of treatments.
"
"For many dogs, however, the usual treatment involves phlebotomy, or bloodletting. Thinning the blood allows for easier passage of nutrients and oxygen through vessels to the tissues.
"
"Dogs undergoing treatment often need a several-hour hospital stay. While there, blood is drawn and replaced with IV fluids, which helps dilute the blood.
"
"This procedure may be needed several times over the first few days to get a better PCV (usually less than 55%) so symptoms will clear up.
"
"Polycythemia in dogs can be managed easily for months to years. However, complications such as blood clots can occur. This can result in acute lameness, cold limbs, respiratory distress, or sudden death.
"
"For advanced cases or when significant symptoms are present, humane euthanasia may be recommended.
"
"Most dogs will have polycythemia for life and need blood draws every couple of weeks.
"
"Your vet will want to watch the bloodwork more often than that at first, but it will be less often over time. Drawing blood regularly may result in iron deficiency, and you may need to give your dog a supplement.
"
"For dogs needing more frequent phlebotomies, your veterinarian may prescribe additional treatment such as radioactive phosphorous or hydroxyurea, a chemotherapeutic drug that targets the bone marrow, which in turn decreases the production of RBC.
"
"Some dogs may be weaned off the medication over time, but the majority will need it for life. Side effects of this medication when used long-term can include gastrointestinal upset, skin lesions, toenail loss, and bone marrow suppression (when not enough blood cells are produced by the bone marrow).
"
"Speak with your vet about all available therapy options, and what monitoring schedule is best for your pup.
"
"Polycythemia in dogs is often unpredictable and not every cause can be entirely prevented. However, there are some measures you can take to help your pup. Water fountains or ice cubes are easy ways to encourage your dog to drink.
"
"Keep your dog hydrated! If too much fluid is lost when they are vomiting or have diarrhea, seek veterinary attention right away.
"
"Don’t leave your dog outside unattended, especially in the summer months, and never leave them in a car.  Only a few minutes in the heat can be fatal.
"
"The life expectancy of dogs diagnosed with a high red blood cell count varies depending on the underlying cause. Studies are mixed—some state that dogs treated can live more than six years, whereas others mention a life expectancy anywhere from eight to 33 months.

"Petroleum hydrocarbon toxicosis is a severe and disease-like reaction  that occurs when a dog is exposed to refined petroleum oil products, or ingests products of this type.
"
"Petroleum products that commonly poison small animals are fuels, solvents, lubricants, and waxes, as well as some pesticides and paints that have a petroleum base. Petroleum products like benzene and mineral spirits are more likely to be inhaled into the lungs, causing chemical pneumonitis, a life-threatening condition in which the petroleum product spreads all over the surface of the lungs, causing inflammation. Products that have an aromatic, ring-like chemical structure, such as benzene, are most likely to cause systemic toxicity (throughout the body).
"
"Putting petroleum products like gasoline or kerosene on a dog’s skin, or near its mouth, will poison it. Dogs are sometimes exposed to these products through exposure to accidental spills, and sometimes people will put gasoline, or other solvents, on a dog to remove something that has gotten onto its skin or hair, such as paint and other sticky substances.
"
"Do not induce vomiting with this type of poisoning, as the substance may do more harm coming back through the esophagus than it did going down. Or, your dog could breath some of the toxin into its lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia.
"
"Cats are also susceptible to petroleum hydrocarbon toxicosis. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected by the toxin, as well as to be able to rule out other toxicities, such as ethylene glycol or drug exposure. If you can take a sample of your dog’s vomit to your veterinarian, treatment can possibly be administered with more immediacy.
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Your veterinarian will test vomit or stomach contents for petroleum distillates. Some animals develop aspiration pneumonia from inhalation of a petroleum product. Your veterinarian will take X-ray images of the chest to look for evidence of inflammation and pneumonia, so that it can be treated immediately.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will give your dog activated charcoal to decontaminate and neutralize the toxin. If your dog ingested the petroleum products recently, a stomach lavage (wash) will also be performed. Causing the dog to vomit is usually not wise under these circumstances, as the dog may contract aspiration pneumonia, a potential and very serious side effect of vomiting.
"
"Pollen is small particles or dust from flowers, trees, and other plants that are transported in the wind, on animals, and on insects to other plants.
"
"Pollen is very fine and almost invisible to the naked eye most of the time. It can coat your dog’s fur and feet after they go outside. It can also travel into your home on the breeze or your skin or clothing. While pollen is vital for plants to spread and flourish, it causes one of the most common seasonal allergies for dogs.
"
"A seasonal allergy is an allergy that is worse during certain times of the year. Pollen is the classic example, but there are other seasonal allergies that flare up during specific times of the year.
"
"There are many types of pollen, and the levels vary by season and region. Grasses and trees blooming in the spring differ from plants that bloom in the fall.
"
"While most trees start to bloom in the spring, ragweed is one of the most common fall pollinators in many parts of the country.
"
"When dogs inhale or consume pollen by licking their feet or fur, they can have various allergic reactions.
"
"The tiny pollen particle is seen as a foreign substance by the dog’s immune system, which mounts an attack in response.
"
"The main cell type the immune system mobilizes during the attack is called a mast cell. Mast cells are responsible for the production of histamine, among other biochemicals. When histamine is released, it causes itching, redness, and swelling.
"
"Itchy, watery eyes
"
"Redness of the skin
"
"In all cases of uncomplicated petroleum hydrocarbon ingestion (i.e., not contaminated with some other, more toxic substance), the primary goal is to minimize the risk of aspiration into the dog's lungs. Your veterinarian may give your dog oxygen therapy, depending on the health of its lungs when it arrives at the veterinary hospital. If your dog had petroleum hydrocarbons on its skin or fur, it will be bathed at the hospital, and possibly given topical antibiotics to prevent infection of the skin due to irritation.
"
"Keep all petroleum products and petroleum-based products out of the your dog's reach, preferably in a locked or childproof cabinet, to prevent accidental poisoning. If your dog shows any signs of respiratory distress at home after it is released from the hospital, such as an increased breathing rate, panting, coughing, etc., call your veterinarian immediately and take your dog to a veterinary hospital for emergency treatment.

"Sneezing or reverse sneezing

"
"Pollen allergies in dogs are caused by an overzealous response by the dog’s immune system triggered by pollen. The immune system is designed to keep the dog safe from foreign substances like bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
"
"With allergies, the immune system sees the pollen as a more formidable enemy than it actually is. The immune system mobilizes the troops, leading to inflammation in the skin and tissues that the allergen comes into contact with. This results in physical changes in the dog’s body as the inflammation leads to redness, swelling, itching, and an increase in the production of tears or fluids in the immune system’s attempt to get rid of the foreign substance.
"
"There is a genetic component to allergies. Some dogs are more likely to have their immune system respond to pollen in this way because of their genes. However, the exact mechanism of why allergies develop in some dogs and not in others is not fully understood.
"
"Breeds more prone to allergies include:
"
"Pit Bull Terriers
"
"French and English Bulldogs
"
"Golden and Labrador Retrievers
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Cocker Spaniels
"
"Boxers
"
"West Highland White Terriers
"
"The U.S.  is broken up into different allergy zones organized based on the type of plants and trees that bloom in those regions. Kansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Texas top the allergy charts every year. Cities in Florida, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina also have high pollen counts.
"
"The Rocky Mountain regions, like Utah, Colorado, and Arizona, all tend to have lower amounts of pollen compared to other states. Pet parents who move from one state to another may see a change in their dog’s allergies as they alter the dog’s exposure to the triggering pollen.
"
"Pollen allergies are often diagnosed based on history and a physical exam. Your dog’s veterinarian may run some tests to ensure something else isn’t causing your dog’s itchy skin. They will thoroughly look your pet over for any signs of external parasites, such as fleas or ticks. They may also scrape the skin to look for mites.
"
"The gold standard for diagnosing environmental allergies is intradermal (meaning “within the skin”) allergy testing. This is usually done by a veterinary dermatologist. To do this test, they will shave a patch on your dog’s side to see how their skin reacts to several different common allergens for that region. This is very similar to how allergies are diagnosed in humans, and allergy treatment can be designed for each dog based on those results.
"
"In private practice, some veterinarians may elect to run blood work to look for antibodies to various allergens. While this method is not as accurate as intradermal skin testing, it is another test available for narrowing down which pollens may be more triggering to your pet’s immune system.
"
"Pollen allergies are treated in different ways, depending on the severity of the reaction and the amount of exposure to the allergen. Mild allergies are often managed seasonally with antihistamines. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications like Benadryl® and Zyrtec® may be recommended, depending on clinical signs.
"
"While there are several OTC allergy medications that are used in dogs, always talk to your vet about the appropriate dose and whether a medication is safe to start in your pet. Never give your dog medication meant for people without first speaking with your veterinarian.
"
"More severe pollen allergies may require prescription allergy medications like Apoquel® or steroids. Some dogs may find relief from a long-acting injectable medication like Cytopoint®.
"
"If you elect to have your pet tested to identify exactly which pollen species they’re allergic to, allergy injections can be made tailored to your dog. These injections work by a process called hyposensitization (or allergy desensitization), where your dog’s immune system is exposed to very small microdoses, increasing the amounts of the allergen to gradually increase their tolerance for it.
"
"Several supplements and prescription foods may be beneficial to dogs with allergies as well. Omega fatty acids aid in boosting the natural barrier function of the skin. Products like Vetoquinol® Omega, Nutramax® Welactin, and Dechra EicosaDerm™ all contain omega-3s and are easy to administer to dogs. Some prescription diets, like Hill’s® Derm Complete, are fortified with skin support ingredients to make pollen allergies more manageable year-round.
"
"Topical therapy can also be useful for reducing pollen allergies. Medicated shampoos, like Douxo S3™ shampoo and KetoChlor® medicated shampoo, can help to reduce yeast and bacteria on the skin so that they don’t overgrow while the immune system is dealing with the pollen allergy.
"
"Ear infections also occur frequently in patients with allergies. Regular ear cleaning with canine ear cleansers, like EpiOtic®, can help reduce the frequency of ear infections.
"
"An important component of allergy management is flea and tick control. Many dogs have allergies to fleas and ticks in addition to pollen. Keeping them on a high-quality prevention product can reduce overall inflammation and itchy skin that can make other allergies worse.
"
"Pollen allergies are managed rather than cured. Once you’ve identified which season affects your pet the most, it is helpful to start allergy medications right before the pollen they’re allergic to starts blooming. Some dogs have year-round allergies and are allergic to various pollens that span multiple seasons. These dogs may need to be on regular allergy oral medications or injections for their entire life.
"
"Untreated allergies lead to secondary skin infections and considerable discomfort. If you are waiting to see your veterinarian for prescription allergy medication, consider using a recovery cone in the meantime to prevent your dog from licking and chewing themselves when they are not under direct supervision, to avoid hot spots and other self-trauma.
"
"Pollen allergies cannot be prevented without moving to a different region that lacks the pollen(s) that your dog is allergic to. Despite this, there are several things you can do to reduce the amount of pollen in your dog’s life:
"
"If your dog is allergic to grass pollen, wipe down their feet and undercarriage after they come in from being outside.
"
"Keeping your pet cool and indoors can reduce flare-ups.
"
"Regular bathing every two to four weeks may reduce pollen on their skin and coat.
"
"Using a high-quality HEPA filter may aid in reducing pollen count in the home that is brought inside on skin and clothing.
"
"Wash all your pet’s bedding regularly to minimize accumulation on surfaces they come into regular contact with.
"
"Yes, pollen allergies are the most common type of seasonal allergies in dogs. Tree, grass, and weed pollen are all among the more common triggers for dog pollen allergies.
"
"Common medications prescribed for pollen allergies include:
"
"Antihistamines
"
"Steroids
"
"Apoquel®
"
"Cytopoint®

"Fungal pneumonia refers to a form of pneumonia in which the lungs become inflammed due to a deep fungal infection, known as a mycotic infection. The inflammation in this form of pneumonia may occur in the interstitial tissues (the spaces between the tissue cells); in the lymphatic vessels (the vessels within the body that transport white-blood-cell-rich lymph liquid); or in the peribronchial tissues of the lung (the tissues surrounding the bronchi -- the airways going from the windpipe to the lungs).
"
"Both dogs and cats may develop fungal pneumonia, although this type of pneumonia occurs less commonly in cats. Some dogs are more susceptible to certain types of fungal disease; for example, German Shepherds appear to be more susceptible to infection from the Aspergillus fungus. Male dogs are affected two to four times as often as females.
"
"If you would like to learn about how fungal pneumonia affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Symptoms of fungal pneumonia may include a history of anorexia and corresponding weight loss, fever, discharge from the nose or eyes, coughing, difficulty breathing, lameness, and eye problems, possibly as severe as sudden blindness. A physical exam may also reveal depression, emaciation, and a crackling sound in the lungs while breathing.
"
"There are a number of fungi that can cause mycotic (deep fungal) infections; some of these include Blastomyces, Histoplasma, and Aspergillus. Fungal pneumonia is geographically varying, as the different fungi responsible for mycotic infection are found in various areas of the United States. Blastomycosis, from the Blastomyces organism, for example, is found in the Southeast and Midwest, while Aspergillosis, from the Aspergillus organism, is widespread throughout the United States.
"
"Contact with one of the fungi capable of causing mycotic infection may lead to fungal pneumonia. The exact method of contraction varies depending on the specific type of fungus. Blastomyces dermatitidis, for example, primarily enters the body by inhalation into the lungs, while the Cryptococcus neoformans fungal organism generally enters the body through the nasal cavity and then migrates into the eyes and/or central nervous system from this point of entry.
"
"Environmental exposure to any of the fungi responsible for causing fungal pneumonia may lead to the development of this disease. Thus, exposure to soils rich in organic matter, bird droppings, or fecal matter may increase the odds of contracting it.
"
"The only way to definitively diagnose fungal pneumonia is to identify the potential organism through the analysis of a skin nodule sample, or biopsy of a lymph node. Further diagnostic procedures may include urine analysis, thoracic radiographs of the chest and lungs, and abdominal ultrasounds.
"
"If fungal pneumonia is not the cause of the dog’s symptoms, other forms of pneumonia, such as parasitic or bacterial-induced pneumonia, may be to blame. Other alternate diagnoses include chronic bronchial disease or pulmonary edema.
"
"
"
"If your dog is still eating, your veterinarian will prescribe medication to be given at home. If it has developed severe symptoms, such as drastic weight loss due to anorexia and dehydration, hospitalization may be necessary to stabilize your dog so that further treatment can be given. Administration of fluids, potassium, oxygen, and antibiotics should be given as necessary.
"
"Note that less than 70 percent of dogs, and an even smaller percentage of cats are likely to respond to treatment for fungal pneumonia. Treatment is expensive and generally required for a minimum of two months -- the exact treatment and length of treatment, however, is dependent on the particular type of fungus that is responsible for the illness.
"
"To avoid dehydration, the dog should be given plenty of fluids and its activities should be restricted. A high-protein diet of calorically dense food is recommended, and all medications will need to be given on a regular basis for the entire amount of time prescribed by your doctor. Checkups should be performed regularly, specifically, thoracic X-ray imaging, before the treatment program is completed.
"
"To avoid fungal pneumonia, it is advised you clean your dog’s living environment of feces or other toxic organic matter.

"
"The term pneumonia refers to an inflammation of the lungs. The lungs can become  inflamed as the result of many conditions. One of these is antigens -- foreign substances that generate an immune response in the body, leading to an abnormal accumulation of a type of white-blood cells called an eosinophil. They also become more active in response to parasites in the body.  Ideally, eosinophils help the body to fight against the antigens or parasites that the body is attempting to eliminate or neutralize. An antigen may enter the body through inhalation, ingestion, or other known pathways into the system (e.g., bite wounds, injuries).
"
"In eosinophilic pneumonia, an increased number of eosinophils and fluid accumulates in the lung tissue, as well as in the various airway channels and tiny sacs within the lung tissue where the oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged, resulting in swelling of the lung tissues, inflammation, and decreased breathing capacity.
"
"Symptoms related to this disease are extremely variable in different animals depending on the severity of the disease. The most common symptoms include:
"
"This type of pneumonia is more commonly seen in dusty or moldy environments, or in areas with high air pollution. Other underling factors include:
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog’s health, including a background history of the symptoms and when they became apparent. After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your dog. Laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. Stool testing is also performed to determine whether a parasitic infection is present. The complete blood count test will reveal inflammation with an increased number of white blood cells, including neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and monocytes (all of which are types of white blood cells). More advanced testing will include measuring the blood gases to evaluate the functioning ability of the respiratory system.
"
"Your veterinarian will also take the fluid samples from the lungs, which can provide a definitive diagnosis by revealing the presence of inflammation along with a large number of eosinophils. Heartworm disease testing is also important, as this common disease can  lead to eosinophilic pneumonia.
"
"Diagnostic imaging of the lungs can be especially helpful in determining the extent and severity of the inflammation so that a prognosis can be made. Chest X-rays will show characteristic changes in the lungs related to this disease, including fluid that has collected in the lung tissue.
"
"If your doctor suspects an allergen, skin testing may be done to determine the allergen, but it is often of little value and may only be ordered if all else has failed.
"
"
"
"In case of severe disease, your dog will need to be hospitalized to stabilize its system. Intravenous fluids will be given to compensate for lost body fluids levels -- to reverse or prevent dehydration, which can quickly become life-threatening. In case of severe respiratory discomfort, oxygen will be given to relieve the dog from struggling. Medications can then be given to open the narrowed airways in order to facilitate normal breathing.
"
"Drugs, such as steroids, are commonly used to reduce symptoms of inflammation. In severe cases, long-term therapy may be required over a few months. In some dogs with overactive immune reactions, immune-suppressive drugs may also be required.
"
"In cases of heartworm disease, specific drugs are used to treat and eradicate the heartworms from the body. Heartworm treatment can be very dangerous for some dogs, so heartworm elimination should only be done under the guidance of a veterinarian.
"
"In cases of fungal infections, antifungal drugs can be used to treat the disease. In more advanced cases with permanent damage or scarring of the lungs, surgery may be required to remove the affected part of the lung.
"
"Complete rest is recommended for your dog while it is under treatment. Good caloric intake is of paramount importance for the recovery of your dog; your veterinarian can guide you on crafting a good diet for recovery and immune system health.
"
"Breathlessness is the most common problem in these animals, and good home-care should be ensured to minimize the stress, with a quiet space to rest that is out of the way of daily foot traffic and away from main entryways. Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up examination, with chest X-rays and laboratory testing to monitor your dog's physical response to the medications.
"
"The prognosis for this this disease depends on the identification of the primary cause or allergen. However, if the allergen can not be identified, long-term palliative treatment may be required to control the symptoms. In case of progressive and chronic disease, the overall prognosis is often not very good.

"Pneumonia refers to an inflammation in the lungs, while interstitial pneumonia refers to a form of pneumonia in which the inflammation occurs in the walls of the alveoli (the air cells of the lungs), or in the interstitium (the spaces between the tissue cells of the alveoli). The alveoli are cellular components of the airway where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged.
"
"Interstitial pneumonia can occur in both cats and dogs, with some breeds being more susceptible than others. For example, the West Highland White Terrier and Bull Terrier are believed to be more susceptible to interstitial lung disease, which can lead to secondary interstitial pneumonia. Miniature Dachshunds are most susceptible to infection by Pneumocystis carinii, a parasite transitional between the stages of fungus and protozoa that causes the lung disease pneumocystosis.
"
"If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"  
"
"Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the disease. Some symptoms that may appear include rapid breathing (tachypnea), coughing, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), mild fever, and discharge from the eyes. Exposure to toxic elements, for example, may also result in gastrointestinal signs, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and a decreased amount of urine production.
"
"There is a wide range of conditions that can lead to interstitial pneumonia in dogs. Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, a congenital (birth) defect, is characterized by inflamed airways and surrounding tissues, and increased odds of interstitial pneumonia.
"
"Other causes include lung cancer, and metabolic disorders such as uremia, in which excess levels of urea and other nitrogenous waste products, which normally are excreted through the urine, appear in the blood.
"
"Exposure to toxic elements through inhalation of dust, gas, or vapor, are also suspect in the diagnosis of causative factors.
"
"There are a wide variety of diagnostic procedures that can be used if symptoms related to interstitial pneumonia appear, including a urine analysis, blood tests, x-ray imaging of the pleural cavity (the area between the chest wall and lungs), and an electrocardiography (ECG) test, used for measuring the electrical impulses of the heart, and for the detection of irregular heart rhythms related to increased pressure on the lungs.
"
"Two more diagnostic procedures that are common when pneumonia is suspected are a tracheal wash, which involves a collection of the fluids and substances lining the trachea (the respiratory airway through which air is transported), and a bronchoscopy, by which a small tube with a tiny camera attached is inserted into the mouth and led into the bronchial airway so that a visual inspection can be made.
"
"
"
"Dogs with severe symptoms should be actively treated in hospital. This is especially important if your dog is exhibiting respiratory distress, in which case an oxygen mask will be used for administering oxygen therapy. Antimicrobial medication to prevent secondary bacterial infection is often prescribed.
"
"Additional medication is dependent upon the underlying cause for the interstitial pneumonia; your veterinarian will advise you on the appropriate medications and home treatment.
"
"Following initial treatment, activity should be restricted, and exposure to any harmful substances, such as dust, vapor, chemical fumes, or tobacco smoke, should be avoided. Administer medications on a regular basis and in full, as prescribed by your veterinarian, and schedule regular follow-up visits.
"
"While there are many causes of interstitial pneumonia, there are a few things dog owners can do to help prevent the development of this disease.

"Most dogs lick their paws, but when licking becomes excessive, problems can arise. Pododermatitis is a common condition in dogs that constantly lick or chew their paws. It starts with inflammation and can result in an infection of the skin, nails, nail folds, or foot pads.
"
"Pododermatitis most commonly occurs between a dog’s toes. Pododermatitis is typically caused by a wide variety of conditions, rather than an actual disease itself. It can affect only one or all four paws  and can occur in any age, gender, or breed of dog.
"
"While pododermatitis only affects the paws (podo means foot; dermatitis means infection or inflammation of the skin), it does often happen with other symptoms, such as itchy skin on the body and/or skin infections.
"
"If left untreated, pododermatitis can become painful and lead to limping or lameness. If you suspect your dog might have pododermatitis, or if they are licking their paws excessively, contact your veterinarian to determine the cause and start a treatment plan.

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Breeds that are more impacted by pododermatitis include:
"
"Pododermatitis has many possible causes, and more than one factor can contribute to it.
"
"There are certain factors that increase a dog’s risk of getting pododermatitis, such as:
"
"Your veterinarian will take a complete medical history, as well as perform a physical exam to determine the extent of your dog’s condition. Pododermatitis itself can be diagnosed visually by looking for symptoms and lesions on your dog’s paws.
"
"Your veterinarian will recommend the best skin diagnostic tests to help determine the underlying cause of pododermatitis to come up with the most effective treatment plan. If nodules are present on your dog’s feet, removing fluid from the center of the lesion can help with a diagnosis.
"
"For more advanced chronic case, or those where a foreign body or tumor is suspected, a local or surgical biopsy and paw X-rays may be necessary. Blood tests will help diagnose any deficiencies in your dog’s hormones, such as thyroid hormone and cortisol levels.
"
"Allergies are often diagnosed once the secondary infections have healed; it often takes longer to eliminate possible allergens from causing them. It’s important to inform your veterinarian about anything you have done (or seen) that might help them diagnose the cause of pododermatitis. Flea prevention status, use of topical therapies, new foods/treats, lifestyle, and environmental changes are things that will help your veterinarian determine the cause.
"
"Once your veterinarian has determined the underlying cause of your dog’s pododermatitis, they can start them on a specific treatment plan. Small lesions that are not causing your dog discomfort, such as those involving one paw or between a few toes, might be treated at home with medicated wipes, mousse, and shampoos such as Duoxo ® S3 (wipes or shampoo) and Dechra ® products.

"If your dog develops pain or the lesions on the paws become extensive or last more than a few days, contact your vet immediately. Antibiotics commonly used for skin infections include: Cephalexin, Cefpodoxime, and Convenia®.
"
"Mange is treated differently, depending on the extent of the lesions. Topical creams and shampoos containing benzoyl peroxide are often used for small, localized lesions. Insect repellent and flea/tick prevention can also help with a demodex infection. Depending on the cause of your dog’s pododermatitis, anti-inflammatory or steroid medications might be prescribed as well.
"
"Depending on the cause of your dog’s pododermatitis, there may not be a cure. However, medical management to keep your dog pain-and-itch free is still possible. Most infectious causes of pododermatitis, such as those caused by bacteria, fungus, ringworm, and mange, can be cured with the right medications.
"
"Hormonal causes can be successfully managed with medication to make up for the low volume of hormones produced by the body. The prognosis can be anywhere from good to guarded, depending on whether the underlying cause can be diagnosed and successfully treated.
"
"Pododermatitis can be a very long and complicated process to diagnose and treat, and it can be quite frustrating to pet parents. Continued follow-up exams and diagnostics will help your vet get to the bottom of the issue as soon as possible, but it can take weeks to months.
"
"You may be able to prevent pododermatitis. If you notice your dog licking right away, use a recovery collar and take them to the veterinarian for treatment of their underlying condition.
"
"Depending upon the underlying cause of pododermatitis, it can take days to weeks to months to heal. Some causes of pododermatitis can be cured and others can be managed with appropriate treatment.
"
"Pododermatitis requires medical attention and treatment to heal. If your dog has been licking and biting their paws with subsequent symptoms, contact your veterinarian.
"
"Yes, pododermatitis can be caused by food allergies in dogs. While licking and chewing the paws are common signs of food allergies in young to middle-aged dogs, this can also be from environmental allergies or other causes.

"Pleural effusion—fluid accumulation around the lungs—is a rare condition in dogs that is considered a medical emergency, especially if it becomes severe enough to cause trouble breathing.  
"
"Pleural effusion is an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which is abnormal. The pleural space is a body cavity that extends between the lungs and the chest wall on both sides of the chest, and from the mediastinum in the upper chest to the diaphragm. This cavity is lined with pleura—a thin membrane that consists of mesothelial cells, connective tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatics.
"
"Pleural effusion occurs when either too much fluid is being produced by the body or dumped into the pleural space, or when too little fluid is reabsorbed by the pleura itself, leading to fluid accumulation. The pleura normally produces a small amount of fluid that acts as a lubricant to keep the chest wall from sticking to the lungs during breathing.
"
"Respiratory distress is ALWAYS a medical emergency in dogs. If your dog is having trouble breathing, contact a veterinarian immediately.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Clinical signs of pleural effusion in dogs can range from unnoticeable to severe. Sometimes, when effusion is minimal, your dog will show no symptoms at home. As fluid continues to accumulate, however, you may notice some of the following signs:
"
"Increased respiratory rate: A normal respiratory rate in a dog at rest (or sleeping) should be less than 30 breaths per minute (one inspiration and one expiration = one full breath). When this progressively increases above 30 breaths per minute or is paired with other signs of respiratory distress, it is considered a medical emergency.
"
"Difficulty breathing: This includes panting, an outstretched neck, increased effort on inspiration, an abdominal component to respirations, and/or gasping.
"
"Coughing: Due to pressure placed by fluid accumulation on the lungs and airways, coughing is a frequent side effect. If your dog is coughing frequently, violently, or if the cough is paired with any increased respiratory rate or trouble breathing, contact a vet immediately.
"
"Restlessness: Often dogs with moderate to severe pleural effusion will pace or have trouble getting comfortable due to fluid accumulation. They may lay in a certain position that allows the neck to be outstretched and the chest to expand. Usually, they will have trouble sleeping.
"
"Exercise intolerance: If your dog is used to daily 2-mile walks but is suddenly sitting after walking a block to catch his breath, or starts coughing during his walks, this can be an indicator of underlying lung, heart, or airway issues.
"
"Cyanotic gums: This blue to purple discoloration of the gums occurs secondary to decreased oxygenation in the body and is considered a medical emergency, unless your dog is a breed that normally has pigmentation to their gums.
"
"Lethargy: General tiredness is a vague clinical sign, but is often linked to pleural effusion.
"
"Decreased appetite: This is a general clinical sign of pleural effusion, and can be noted in early or late stages.
"
"Vomiting: This is a vague clinical sign of pleural effusion, and can be noted in early or late stages.
"
"Weight loss: Fat and muscle loss can be noticed in chronic cases of pleural effusion.
"
"Pleural effusion has many causes in dogs. Medical conditions that cause changes in pressures in the body, protein content in the body, and a leaky lymphatic system can lead to fluid collection in the pleural space. Fluid buildup within this space causes problems, as it impedes the lungs from filling with air due to pressure; this in turn leads to trouble breathing.
"
"Pleural effusion differs from pulmonary edema—the term for fluid within the lungs, not around the lungs. Pulmonary edema can also lead to trouble breathing but for different reasons, and is often caused by congestive heart failure, pulmonary thromboembolism, choking, drowning, or electric shock. Treatment for pleural effusion and pulmonary edema differ greatly, which is why it is important to distinguish between the two conditions.
"
"Your veterinarian will obtain a thorough history of your dog’s clinical signs, previous medical conditions, current medications, when the symptoms started, and how they have progressed. Your veterinarian will then perform a complete physical examination and may suggest diagnostic testing based on what they discover. They may suspect pleural effusion based solely on examination alone.
"
"Bloodwork—including a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, heartworm status, and electrolyte panel—is often evaluated to investigate for systemic disease. Chest radiographs are typically obtained as well, which illuminates fluid within the chest cavity and can range from scant (minimal changes to the lungs on x-rays) to severe (complete blocking of the heart silhouette on X-rays).
"
"Treatment of pleural effusion in dogs depends on the cause of the fluid accumulation. Thoracentesis is the mainstay of therapy for most dogs with effusion, and is considered both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. This technique provides immediate relief by removing the fluid from the pleural space, thus allowing the lungs to expand more effectively. Usually, breathing improves instantly once the procedure is started.
"
"Supplemental oxygen is often considered and given, but it is not going to help the lungs expand—which is why thoracocentesis is so important in therapy.
"
" 
"
"Most causes of pleural effusion in dogs require lifelong management to lessen the risk of fluid accumulation around the lungs. 
"
"Antibiotics are used to treat effusion caused by bacterial infection (Pyothorax). Diuretics are often used in cases of effusion secondary to congestive heart failure. Sometimes steroids and/or chemotherapy medications are necessary if the fluid buildup is secondary to cancer.
"
"It is important to note that for all causes of pleural effusion, if the fluid causes any breathing issues (increased respiratory rate/effort), the fluid must be drained to give relief and to see improvement. Medications can be helpful to lessen fluid re-accumulation around the lungs, but they only help to reduce small amounts of fluid.

"Plague is a bacterial disease caused by the parasitic genus Yersinia pestis. This condition occurs worldwide. In the United States, it is predominantly found in the southwest between the months of May and October. Carriers of this disease include rats, squirrels and mice; the disease is typically transmitted when a rodent either bites, or is bitten by a dog.
"
"The infection travels rapidly to the lymph nodes, where white blood cells are produced. The resulting reaction from the lymph nodes is a rapid multiplication of white cells, abnormal fluid build up with swelling, and possible skin breakage. Dogs infected with plague will experience fever, inflammation, and excessive pain due to the lymph nodes being chronically swollen.
"
"This disease is rare in dogs because they tend to have a high resistance to the bacteria. However, there are no gender or breeds more susceptible to plague.
"
"Although it is quite rare, plague is transmittable to humans, and care should be taken to avoid fleas and body fluids from an animal that is suspected of being infected with the Yersinia bacterium.
"
"Cats may also be infected with plague. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"There are three forms of plague: bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, and septicemic plague. Symptoms associated with bubonic plague will include painfully swollen lymph nodes, fever, inflammation, depression, vomiting, dehydration, diarrhea, enlarged tonsils, and anorexia. The head and neck area will swell considerably, and should the dog survive, its lymph nodes may abscess and then rupture and drain. Other symptoms include discharge from the eyes, mouth ulcers, and a loss of appetite, with visible weight loss being evident. Coma may follow.
"
"The normal incubation period for bubonic plague is between two and seven days after the dog has been bitten. In the case of pneumonic plague, a lung infection will occur; and with septicemic plague, the same symptoms as bubonic plague will appear, along with systemic infection of the blood.
"
"The Yersinia bacterium is transmitted to dogs when an infected flea bites them, or when they ingest an infected rodent. Another possible cause for exposure could come from the animal’s environment.
"
"If the home is heavily infested with fleas, or if the homeowner resides near a wildlife habitat, where the dog is exposed to rodents, this could put the dog at a higher risk of contracting the plague. Garbage, woodpiles, and food sources can also be outlets for transmission of this disease.
"
"Your veterinarian will run a full diagnostic evaluation on the dog, including blood samples, culture samples of fluids, and kidney and liver testing, in order to establish a definitive diagnosis of this disease. A swollen lymphatic system is a clear indication that infection is present and blood tests will show the level of white blood cells present, amongst other things, further aiding in identifying the presence of plague bacteria.
"
"A thorough physical examination will be undertaken to check for swelling around the neck and head, liver and kidneys, and to check for signs of dehydration, fever, lung infection, or anything else that will conclusively pinpoint the plague as a cause for your dog’s illness.
"
"Medication will be administered to treat the symptoms, and if plague is confirmed, or suspected, your dog will be isolated until the condition is resolved.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition.
"
"
"
"Your dog will require hospitalization to treat the more severe symptoms of plague, and will be given a full course of antibiotics. Dogs that are weakened and dehydrated, will require an intravenous drip to assist in rehydration. Flea treatment will also be required. The incidence of mortality is high for dogs that are not treated early and effectively.
"
"Ongoing flea control and management of rodents is a must. There is no home management plan for this disease, and all cases of suspected infection should be reported to your veterinarian immediately. However, maintaining a flea free home and keeping rubbish, food, and woodpiles to a minimum will help greatly in reducing the risk of plague infection.
"
"Dogs should be neutered, as this aids in subduing their hunting instinct. Additionally, indoor dogs are less likely to be exposed to the Yersinia bacterium. but if you do not have the option of keeping your pet indoors, you will need to provide preventive flea care to your dog.
"
"When travelling to areas where the plague bacteria may be present, it is wise to make sure your dog is kept on a leash or in an enclosed environment at all times so that exposure to wild rodents or fleas that may be carrying this disease is limited.

"Phosphofructokinase is the most important rate-controlling enzyme required for glycolysis, the metabolic pathway that coverts glucose into pyruvate, thereby releasing energy to be used for a variety of functions such as maintaining the shape of red blood cells. Phosphofructokinase deficiency also greatly inhibits the energy skeletal muscles require for exercising.
"
"This metabolic disorder has a genetic basis, mainly affecting English Springer spaniels, American cocker spaniels, and mixed-breed dogs.
"
"Symptoms associated with this disorder will depend on the severity of the phosphofructokinase deficiency. Some of the more common ones include:
"
"A deficiency in the phosphofructokinase enzyme.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood test, biochemical profile, and urinalysis.
"
"Pica is a common condition where a dog consistently eats objects that are not food items. A dog needs to ingest the item—not just chew on it—for it to be considered pica.
"
"Metal, plastic, cloth, garbage, rocks, paper, dirt, and feces are common non-nutritional items that dogs with pica ingest. Due to a dog’s ability to detect their pet parents’ scent, items such as underwear, socks, pantyhose, towels, and wet wipes are particular favorites.
"
"Some dogs will consume any non-food item they come in contact with, but others will choose the same type of item every time. Pica is typically considered a psychological, obsessive-compulsive habit, but it can be the result of a medical condition or poor nutrition.
"
"Ingesting these items can be very dangerous and it puts your dog at risk for toxicity, choking, stomach upset, or even a life-threatening gastrointestinal blockage. If you see or suspect your dog may have eaten a non-food item, contact your veterinary immediately.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"You may catch your dog eating a non-food item, which can be the first sign of pica in dogs. This compulsive ingestion can lead to ulcers and irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, in addition to the possibly of a serious obstruction of the stomach or intestines. Common clinical signs associated with pica (besides ingestion of a non-food item) include:
"
"Vomiting
"
"Blood testing will typically reveal anemia and other red blood cell abnormalities. A biochemistry profile, meanwhile, will usually show abnormally high levels of potassium, calcium, magnesium, urea, and total protein. Bilirubin levels will particularly be high (which can also be confirmed with the urinalysis) due to the increased destruction of red blood cells and subsequent release of bilirubin. Your veterinarian may also suggest DNA testing, such as a poly chain reaction test (PCR), to identify carrier dogs, or run further testing to measure the levels of phosphofructokinase enzyme.
"
"
"
"It is vital that your veterinarian stabilize and rehydrate your dog first. This may involve employing fluid therapy (IV fluids) or blood transfusions, especially if the dog has severe anemia. The only way to treat phosphofructokinase deficiency, however, is through bone marrow transplantation, which is expensive and requires a healthy donor.
"
"If properly managed, most dogs can have a normal lifespan, though some may have fatal complication due to severe anemia or kidney failure. It is vital that the dog be kept in a stress-free environment, away from other pets or active children. It should also not be allowed to strenuously exercise or be placed in an overly hot environment.

"Visible distress or abnormal behavior
"
"Pica can be the result of an illness, parasites, or a nutritional deficiency, but it is more often due to a mental health condition such as boredom, depression, anxiety, or extreme hunger.
"
"The most common form of pica in dogs is coprophagia, which is the ingestion of feces. In nursing female dogs, pica is common and is considered normal, because the mother will ingest the feces of her puppy when she licks around the anus to stimulate a bowel movement. Coprophagia is also common in young puppies, but it is a behavior they typical grow out of as they age. Dogs with separation anxiety commonly chew and ingest items when their owners are not around.
"
"While certain breeds like Labradors are more naturally prone to pica, dogs that have high energy but do not get enough exercise or stimulation often choose to ingest non-food items. Pica is also considered an attention-seeking behavior and can result from lack of socialization with humans or other dogs. Dogs on steroid medications such as prednisone or anti-seizure medications like phenobarbital often have an insatiable appetite, which can lead to pica.
"
"Both anemia (low iron) and medical conditions can prevent a dog from absorbing nutrients from their food, often causing them to eat soil, clay, and dirt. Pica can occur with the following medical conditions:
"
"Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA)
"
"Iron deficiency anemia
"
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
"
"Liver or pancreatic disease
"
"Hookworm infection
"
"Cancers of the stomach or intestines
"
"Diabetes mellitus
"
"Hyperthyroidism
"
"Malnutrition or an unbalanced diet
"
"Your dog’s veterinarian will do a complete physical examination and will recommend lab work, including a complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry profile, fecal check, and a urinalysis to assess your dog after ingesting a non-food item. These tests will be able to diagnose some underlying medical conditions.
"
"If inflammatory bowel disease or conditions of the pancreas are suspected, your vet will need to do more blood testing, in addition to an abdominal ultrasound. Most non-food items ingested by a dog can be seen on an x-ray of the abdomen that includes the stomach and intestines.
"
"An X-ray will also help determine if your dog has an obstruction from the object they ingested, and to determine how to remove the item.
"
"Once all medical conditions have been ruled out as the cause of pica, behavioral conditions are then diagnosed as the underlying cause. The cause of pica might be difficult to identify in some dogs, and can be a source of frustration not only for both pet parent and veterinarian.
"
"Depending upon the underlying cause of pica, it is possible to cure this condition. Medical conditions causing pica need to be treated thoroughly in order to help your dog. If your dog has an intestinal blockage, they will need to be hospitalized and undergo surgery to have the item removed. And if you suspect you dog is choking from an item stuck in their throat, contact an emergency veterinarian immediately.
"
"If all medical conditions have been ruled out and a compulsive behavior is suspected, it’s often recommended that your dog be seen by a board-certified veterinary behaviorist or a behavior therapist. These professionals have extensive expertise and can help with intensive behavior modification techniques or by even prescribing medications to help treat your dog’s mental health condition. Pica caused by behavioral issues is usually much more difficult to treat.
"
"Behavior modification can include methods to reduce anxiety and training a dog to keep their mouth occupied with other things that they do not ingest.
"
"Increasing the amount of exercise, such as longer walks or playing fetch, as well as mental stimulation with puzzles or safe chew toys, can be helpful. Make sure to walk your dog on a leash to monitor their behavior and prevent them from eating rocks, dirt, or feces.
"
"Be sure to exercise your dog daily and keep their mind engaged. If your dog tends to ingest items such as socks and underwear, some good practices are to keep a lid on the hamper and close the laundry room door so they can’t get to clothing. In severe cases, a basket muzzle might be needed on your dog most of the time, especially when they are left home alone, in the yard, or on a walk.
"
"For pica in dogs, there are some natural or herbal remedies that can help. For those with anxiety, consider using an Adaptil® pheromone diffuser and/or calming collar in addition to a chewable supplement like VetriScience® Composure.
"
"Probiotics promote gut health and can help some dogs with intestinal conditions leading to pica. Supplements are also available to sprinkle on stool—promoting an unfavorable taste—and can help with preventing coprophagia. 
"
"Unless your dog has a medical condition that can be cured, which eliminates pica, it is often a lifelong condition that needs to be managed. Depending upon the underlying cause, it can take weeks, months, or even years for this compulsive condition to be resolved.
"
"Crate training is a great way to ensure that your dog does not ingest things around the home when they are alone or when you are asleep. Consistent and routine mental and physical stimulation in dogs with pica is of the utmost importance. Toys that can be stuffed with food can be useful, as they will keep your dog occupied, which redirects the behavior to a more appropriate choice. It is critical that dogs are supervised to stop them from destroying the toy and swallowing pieces. Ultimately, the best way to prevent pica is to put away the non-food objects so your dog cannot get at them, while also working to manage or eliminate the underlying condition.

"When the muscles in the pelvic diaphragm of an animal fail to provide necessary support, a hernia can develop causing a great amount of pain and discomfort. A hernia of the perineal area is more common in dogs than in cats, and in males rather than in females. Treatment often involves surgery and then prescription drugs to ease the animal's pain.
"
"Physical symptoms can include swelling of the perineal area, protrusion from the pelvis or surrounding areas, and the inability to control the bowels.
"
"While a hernia of the pelvic diaphragm can develop in any breed of animal, they are much more common in the following breeds:
"
"A hernia of the perineal region is more common in older animals than in younger as the region of the animal's body becomes weaker over time. It is not completely understood as to why this particular region of an animal's body becomes weaker, but there is some thought that hormones may be a factor. Another underlying cause for this type of hernia is prostatic disease or cancer. Other possible causes can include colorectal disease and atrophy of the pelvis.
"
"A rectal examination of the animal can identify several possible causes of the diaphragm hernia, including tissue disease in the anal area, inflammation of the anal area, and inflammation of the urinary tract. X-rays and ultrasounds are also often used to view the damaged area. This ensures that there are not any more serious underlying causes of the problem, and allows the veterinarian to view the internal area surrounding the hernia.
"
"
"
"Surgery is often recommended to repair the hernia damage, but only for animals that are in stable condition. Following surgery, the rectum is very sensitive, and laxatives, stool softeners, and enemas may help not only maintain stool consistency, but improve the comfort of the animal when defecating.
"
"There is a high incidence of infection associated with this type of surgery, so extreme attention to recovery care is recommended afterwards. Common surgical complications can include infection, fecal incontinence, recurrence, and full or partial paralysis of the nerve endings surrounding the surgical site.
"
"This disease is extreme rare for dogs that are neutered, so full castration is a preventative measure. No other means of prevention are currently known.

"A dog’s heart is surrounded by a thin membrane (layer of tissue) called the pericardium, which forms a sac-like structure around the heart. Normally, there is no fluid between the pericardium and the heart, so the heart can beat freely within the sac. When fluid builds up in the space between the pericardium and the heart, it’s called pericardial effusion.
"
"Having fluid in the space between the heart and the pericardium puts more pressure on the heart, making it more difficult for the heart’s chambers to fill with blood. When they do not, the heart cannot in turn pump enough blood to the rest of the body. When this occurs, it’s called cardiac tamponade.
"
"Pericardial effusion doesn’t happen to most dogs, but when it does it is considered a medical emergency.
"
"
"
"Although dogs with pericardial effusion are usually very sick, it’s difficult for pet parents to recognize pericardial effusion as the cause. Symptoms include:
"
"Collapse or weakness
"
"Lethargy or exercise intolerance
"
"Lack of interest in food
"
"Rapid or labored breathing
"
"Gagging or vomiting
"
"Pale gums
"
"Fluid-filled abdomen
"
"These signs are not specific and could be signs of other diseases, many of which are also emergencies. If you have a collapsing, weak, pale, or mentally changed dog, this is an emergency. Contact your veterinarian immediately.
"
"Several things can cause pericardial effusion in dogs:
"
"Tumors, such as hemangiosarcoma or heart base tumors
"
"Idiopathic pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium without a known cause)
"
"Clotting disorders
"
"Heart failure
"
"Toxins like rodenticides (rat poison)
"
"Low blood protein levels
"
"Infections
"
"Tumors of the heart and idiopathic pericarditis are the most common causes of pericardial effusion.
"
"Infectious causes of pericardial effusion are uncommon but can come from things like penetrating foreign objects, which are usually sharp objects that penetrate the body and potentially poke into the pericardium. Two bacteria that have been linked to bacterial pericardial effusion are Actinomyces and Nocardia. The soil fungus Coccidioides immitis has also caused pericardial effusion.
"
"Dog breeds that may be predisposed to one or more causes of pericardial effusion include:
"
"Golden Retrievers
"
"Labrador Retrievers
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Great Danes
"
"Saint Bernards
"
"Boxers
"
"French Bulldog
"
"English Bulldog
"
"American Bulldog
"
"When your veterinarian does their physical examination, they may notice that your dog’s heart sounds muffled when they’re listening with their stethoscope. This is because the fluid in the pericardial sac is dulling the sounds made by the beating heart.
"
"The veterinarian may also hear that the heart rate is too fast (tachycardia). As the body tries to make up for less blood being pumped out, the heart pumps faster. The veterinarian may also note changes in how the pulse feels when they palpate (examine by touch) the dog’s femoral artery or jugular vein.
"
"An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) will confirm fluid in the pericardial sac. While doing the echocardiogram, the veterinarian will also look for changes to the heart itself, such as enlarged heart chambers or a tumor on the heart.
"
"By placing a needle into the pericardial space and removing some of the fluid (pericardiocentesis), the veterinarian can find out if the fluid is blood, plasma, pus, or chyle (lymphatic fluid and fats). The fluid type helps narrow down the possible causes of pericardial effusion. Dogs must be sedated for this procedure to keep them from moving.
"
"Other testing to confirm the underlying cause of the pericardial effusion includes chest X-rays, abdominal ultrasonography, and routine blood and urine testing. The veterinarian may also place an ECG on the pet to check their heart rhythm. Coagulation (clotting) profiles may be run if the vet thinks there may be a clotting disorder or toxin exposure.
"
"If your dog has collapsed, the emergency room will usually first give oxygen to your pet and help circulation by giving intravenous (IV) fluids.
"
"In the short term, a dog with pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade should generally undergo pericardiocentesis (draining fluid from the pericardium). The exceptions to this include dogs with coagulation disorders, dogs that have a ruptured (torn) heart chamber, or dogs with active hemorrhage (bleeding from a broken blood vessel). Removing fluid from the pericardium will relieve the pressure on the heart, allowing it to beat correctly.
"
"Long-term management is focused on the underlying cause of the pericardial effusion. In some cases, pericardiocentesis may need to be repeated as needed.
"
"When there is a heart base tumor, a small window is cut into the pericardium (pericardial window) to allow the fluid to flow into the chest, where it will be reabsorbed. With recurrent idiopathic pericarditis, the pericardium is surgically removed (subtotal pericardiectomy). These are specialty procedures that are usually performed at a referral hospital.
"
"Some cancers that cause pericardial effusion, such as hemangiosarcoma, are likely to spread to other areas of the body (metastasize). To improve quality and length of life, you may be referred to a veterinary oncologist for chemotherapy.
"
"If there is an infection, the veterinarian may try to get a culture sample so they can pick the right antibiotic. First-choice antibiotic classes include sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, penicillin derivatives, and some cephalosporins. The combination medication amoxicillin-clavulanate may also be selected.
"
"Dogs with heart disease causing congestive heart failure are helped with medications such as furosemide. In dogs with anticoagulant rodenticide toxicity (from eating rat poison or rodents), vitamin K1 is given to the dog to prevent bleeding. With severe bleeding, a blood transfusion may be needed.
"
"The overall prognosis for most dogs with pericardial effusion is uncertain. Generally, if the fluid recovered from the pericardial sac is blood, the situation is more severe than if the fluid recovered is clear or blood-tinged.
"
"A highly aggressive cancer known as hemangiosarcoma is one of the most common causes of pericardial effusion, and survival is typically weeks to months even with aggressive treatment. Pet parents should understand that this cancer is hard to notice until it’s causing problems.
"
"Pericardial effusion can recur in some cases, such as idiopathic pericarditis or heart failure. Keep up on your pet’s veterinary checkups and become familiar with the signs to notice a recurrence early.
"
"Cancer is the most common cause of pericardial effusion in dogs, with one study showing that 71% of patients with pericardial effusion had cancer. The most common cancer that causes pericardial effusion in dogs is hemangiosarcoma.
"
"Pericardial effusion in dogs is a serious medical condition and is almost always an emergency. If your dog is showing signs of pericardial effusion, seek veterinary care right away.

"Periodontal disease, known as dental disease, is one of the most common health issues in dogs. Just as with humans, plaque and tartar can build up on dogs’ teeth. As it accumulates it can get under the gumline, causing gingivitis, an inflammation of the gums.
"
"As the plaque, tartar, and gingivitis progress, bacteria in the mouth begin to break down the support structures for the teeth, a process known as periodontitis. This leads to further buildup of “bad” bacteria in the mouth that cause death of the tissues. These “bad” bacteria also produce sulfur compounds that lead to bad breath.
"
"Depending on the severity of periodontal disease, it can be quite painful for dogs, and may cause them to stop eating. This is especially true if your pet develops a tooth root abscess. Abscesses are painful and are considered a medical emergency.
"
"Periodontal disease in dogs isn’t considered a medical emergency, but the sooner your pup gets treated for dental disease, the better. If dental disease worsens, it can become irreversible, resulting in your pet needing their teeth extracted.
"
"There are four stages of periodontal disease in dogs.
"
"Teeth are held into the jaw by the jawbone and periodontal ligaments. As dental disease progresses, the bone and ligaments begin to break down, until eventually the tooth can fall out.
"
"Staging of dental disease in dogs is based on how much bone loss has occurred around the teeth. These stages are:
"
"Gingivitis with no bone loss. This will appear as redness along the gumline.
"
"Early periodontal disease with more than 25% bone loss
"
"Established periodontal disease with 25% to 50% bone loss
"
"Advanced periodontal disease with more than 50% bone loss
"
"Common symptoms of periodontal disease in dogs include:
"
"Bad breath
"
"Tartar accumulation on the teeth
"
"Red, inflamed gums
"
"Loose teeth
"
"Missing teeth
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Bleeding from the gums, especially when chewing on toys or hard treats
"
"Irritability
"
"Teeth chattering, quivering lips
"
"Sneezing or nasal discharge
"
"Excessive drooling
"
"Favoring one side of the mouth when chewing
"
"Weight loss
"
"Facial swelling (occurs only in dental abscesses)
"
"Roots of the teeth are visible (these should be covered by bone and the gums)
"
"Periodontal disease in dogs is caused by plaque, tartar, and gingivitis in the mouth.
"
"Some things predispose dogs to more rapid development of periodontal disease:
"
"Genetics/breed predisposition, especially small breed dogs and short-muzzled dogs
"
"Enamel defects
"
"Misalignment of the jaw/teeth (underbites/overbites)
"
"Lack of oral hygiene
"
"Wet food diets, which stick to the teeth more than dry food. This provides more food for the bacteria in the mouth. This doesn’t mean wet food is bad—it just requires pet parents to pay closer attention to their pup’s oral hygiene.
"
"When bringing your dog to the vet, mention if your pet is exhibiting any symptoms of dental disease, This can help your vet determine how urgently your dog needs a dental cleaning.
"
"Sometimes a dog’s teeth can look fine, but your pet can still have hidden dental disease. This is because 40% of dogs’ and cats’ dental disease is under the gumline and can only be seen on dental X-rays.
"
"Because periodontal disease is determined by the amount of bone loss around each tooth, full mouth X-rays are required to diagnose it.
"
"In severe cases, the roots of the teeth can visually be seen on a physical exam. If the roots cannot be seen on a physical exam, X-rays are needed to determine the level of periodontal disease.
"
"Only the first stage of periodontal disease is reversible. While further stages cannot be reversed, they can be treated and managed with anesthetic dental cleanings.
"
"Many pet parents have reservations about anesthesia, but it’s in your pet’s best interest. Vets take every precaution possible to ensure pets are kept safe while under anesthesia. Non-anesthetic dental cleanings are not recommended.
"
"While having a dental cleaning, pets can receive all the same care that humans do for our dental cleanings, including:
"
"Full mouth exam with dental charting and probing
"
"Full mouth dental X-rays
"
"Scaling
"
"Polishing
"
"Tooth removal, if needed
"
"All these procedures are recommended to help treat and manage dental disease in dogs.
"
"Because anesthesia is involved in this procedure, dental cleanings can be pricey, depending on the region and whether you go to a general vet or a dental specialist.
"
"Prices can range anywhere from about $500 to $5,000 for dental cleanings for dogs. The higher end of the estimate is if you elect to go to a dental specialist to have specialized procedures done—such as a root canal to save a tooth from being extracted.
"
"Unfortunately, there are no over-the-counter products that treat dental disease. However, some products can help to prevent and slow the progression of dental disease. The Veterinary Oral Health Council has tested various products on the market, and its veterinary dentists have listed products they have found to be the most helpful.
"
"These products are best utilized from an early age, as early as 6 months old. You can even start brushing your puppy’s teeth as early as 8 weeks old to get them used to the process. However, even if you provide great oral hygiene to your pup, they will still need regular dental cleanings throughout life.
"
"Fortunately, the mouth is one of the fastest healing parts of the body. This means most dogs that have an anesthetic dental cleaning recover quickly and uneventfully from the procedure.
"
"Pups that have teeth pulled typically recover within seven days. For these pets, it’s recommended that they receive a wet food diet for the week following the procedure while their gums heal.
"
"After a dental procedure, it’s important to start an at-home dental routine to help prevent recurrence of dental disease.
"
"One of the best ways to prevent further tartar buildup is to brush a dog’s teeth at home once daily with a soft bristle toothbrush.
"
"Brushing a dog’s teeth helps to scrape off plaque. Since plaque is the precursor to tartar, by simply brushing off the plaque layer it can help to prevent further tartar buildup. Pet toothpaste is not required to remove this plaque layer, but it can help with bad breath.
"
"It can be challenging to brush a dog’s teeth, but with patience and training, most dogs eventually tolerate it.
"
"Some alternatives to using a toothbrush include gauze pads, washcloths, or any other soft but coarse fabric that can be used to help scrape the plaque layer off their teeth.
"
"It can take time for dogs to adjust to having their teeth brushed, and even after extensive training, some dogs just don’t tolerate it.
"
"If this is the case, any of the products approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council—such as water additives and powders—can help to prevent further tartar buildup on dogs’ teeth.
"
"Dogs can live for a very long time with periodontal disease—but it’s not without side effects. Sometimes it can decrease your dog’s quality of life and lifespan.
"
"Unfortunately, there are no home remedies for periodontal disease in dogs, particularly the fourth stage.
"
"If left untreated the disease will continue to progress, leading to further gum and bone erosion, which will ultimately cause the teeth to fall out.
"
"This process is painful, which is why it’s recommended to get your pup a dental cleaning immediately to help treat and manage it.
"
"In some cases, if periodontal disease is left untreated it can even lead to infections, a jaw fracture from the bone loss, or organ damage.

"Perianal adenomas are a common type of tumor that occur in the perianal region (area around the anus). They often occur in the sebaceous glands (sweat glands) located in this region. These tumors may also be found on the prepuce (foreskin), base of the tail, and groin. Perianal adenomas are also referred to as hepatoid or circumanal adenomas. 
"
"Perianal adenomas are relatively uncommon and non-cancerous. They pose the greatest risk to male dogs that are not neutered. Surgical removal of a male dog’s testicles (castration) is recommended because castration removes the influence of testosterone which typically stops the progression of this tumor. 
"
"While most perianal bumps are benign, meaning the bumps are non-cancerous, there are some perianal bumps that are cancerous. Cancerous bumps are called perianal adenocarcinomas. If a mass is found in this region, it’s important to schedule an appointment with your veterinarian so a formal diagnosis can be determined.  
"
"The exact cause of perianal adenomas is unknown, but testosterone is thought to encourage excessive production of these cells. Male dogs that are not neutered are at the highest risk of developing perianal tumors, but these tumors can also be seen in spayed females. Female dogs that have not been spayed produce estrogen, which is thought to inhibit the growth of these tumors. 
"
"Perianal adenomas have also been associated with hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing’s Disease), testosterone-producing adrenal tumors, and testicular tumors. 
"
"Pennyroyal oil is derived from plants within the mint family known as Labiatae. It is frequently used in flea powders and sprays and in fragrances. It can be toxic to dogs, particularly when ingested. There has been one reported case of a dog suffering pennyroyal oil poisoning from dermal (skin) exposure as well.
"
"Symptoms expected with pennyroyal oil poisoning include:
"
"The active poison in pennyroyal oil is a chemical known as pulegone, which is toxic to the liver and can cause severe liver damage.
"
"Physical examination findings consistent with pennyroyal oil poisoning together with a history of exposure to plants, fragrances, or flea products containing pennyroyal oil may prompt suspicion of toxicity.
"
"Blood tests reveal abnormalities consistent with liver damage, including elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartine aminotransferase, gamma-glyamyl transferase) and evidence of bleeding (anemia and prolonged clotting times.)
"
"Evidence of hemorrhage (bleeding) may be seen in internal organs, such as the lungs, liver and kidneys.
"
"A definitive diagnosis may be obtained by finding pulegone on gas chromatography (a specialized laboratory test that analyzes for specific chemicals.)
"
"
"
"These tumors are most commonly seen in breeds such as the Cocker Spaniel, Fox Terrier, and Siberian Husky. 
"
"Perianal adenomas are typically pink, hairless, slow-growing tumors located around the anus, prepuce, or under the tail. They are usually less than one inch in diameter and can become ulcerated (when skin breaks) or infected. Perianal adenomas can look similar to cancerous tumors when viewed by the naked eye, however perianal adenomas are benign tumors.   
"
"Some types of perianal adenomas become locally invasive. A surgical biopsy is recommended to confirm the type of tumor and determine the best treatment course.
"
"A biopsy and histopathology are typically the diagnostics of choice for this type of tumor. A biopsy is a common procedure to collect a sample of tissue from the affected area. Histopathology examines the collected sample to determine the type of tumor and to make a formal diagnosis.
"
"For small, non-ulcerated perianal adenomas (tumors where the skin is not broken), the recommended treatment is castration or surgical removal of the male dog’s testicles to prevent progression. 
"
"In most cases the tumors will regress or stop growing after castration. For ulcerated or bleeding tumors, surgical removal is recommended. If male dogs are not castrated, more perianal adenomas can develop.
"
"During recovery, your dog will need wear a recovery collar or recovery suit while their stitches heal. Additionally, antiseptic wipes may be recommended to help during the healing process. 
"
"Tumor removal and castration offer a good prognosis. Tumors recur in less than 10% of cases. Perianal adenomas are noncancerous tumors, so survival times are typically not associated with the presence or absence of these tumors.
"
"Perianal adenocarcinomas are cancerous tumors that arise from the same cell type as perianal adenomas and occur in the same region of the body. Biopsy and histopathology are recommended to differentiate between these two tumor types. Perianal adenocarcinomas typically grow more quickly than perianal adenomas.

"Vomiting can be induced if the dog is not comatose, having respiratory difficulties or having seizures. Gastric lavage (washing out the stomach) may be performed and activated charcoal is frequently administered to bind the toxin.
"
"Bathing with a mild shampoo to remove any pennyroyal oil on the skin and hair coat is recommended.
"
"Fluid therapy may be necessary along with supportive nursing care. N-acetylcysteine may be recommended as well as liver protectants such as S-Adenosylmethionine, Ursodeoxycholic acid, or vitamin E. Gastrointestinal protectants such as cimetidine and/or carafate and antiemetic medidogions to control vomiting may also be used. Antibiotics are frequently administered also.
"
"Use precaution when applying flea products containing pennyroyal oil on dogs. Be sure to follow label directions carefully to avoid overdosing.
"
"Also, keep dogs away from garden plants and other products which contain pennyroyal oil.

"A perianal fistula is a hole near the anus that shouldn’t be there. Sometimes there are only one or two small holes, and other times an affected dog may have many large, draining holes that look like ulcerated wounds near their anus. This condition is also known as anal furunculosis and can be very painful.
"
"The anus is the opening of the rectum through which stool passes when a dog has a bowel movement. When a perianal fistula develops, pet parents may notice a small hole or drainage near the anus. This hole is actually a tract, or tunnel, that isn’t normally there. The tunnel connects the anus to the outside skin and is usually infected.
"
"While this condition can get very serious when it’s not managed, it is generally not considered a medical emergency and can usually be addressed during a veterinarian’s normal hours.
"
"While the exact cause of perianal fistulas is not known, it is suspected to be an autoimmune disease—where the immune system is mistakenly attacking healthy cells and tissue. A genetic component is likely, with German Shepherds being the most commonly affected breed. 84% of dogs with perianal fistulas are reported to be German Shepherds, with middle-aged dogs more commonly affected.
"
"The anal glands, also known as anal sacs, may or may not be involved. Infection of these sacs may lead to an increased risk in developing perianal fistulas. Many dogs with fistulas will also develop colitis, an inflammation of the colon.
"
"Diagnosis is usually made based on a physical exam by a veterinarian. The vet will likely palpate the anus, the fistula, and the anal sacs. This may require sedation, as perianal fistulas can be painful and sedation will help to keep your dog relaxed and stress-free while the doctor examines tissues.
"
"Several conditions need to be ruled out to determine if your dog has a perianal fistula. Anal sac abscesses, tumors of the anal sac and surrounding tissue, and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases can look similar.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend bloodwork prior to starting treatment, to ensure your dog can tolerate the oral medications that may be recommended. Stool and urine samples, x-rays, and even a tissue biopsy may be needed.
"
"Perianal fistulas can be treated or managed in a variety of ways. For most pets, this condition can only be managed, not cured.
"
"It was once believed that surgery was the best option for treatment. Unfortunately, many pets experienced a return of their perianal fistulas after surgery. If the anal sacs are involved, their removal may be recommended.
"
"Currently, oral medications that suppress the immune system are more commonly prescribed to treat perianal fistulas. There are several medications in various combinations that are prescribed for dogs suffering from this condition.
"
"Unfortunately, this medication can be expensive, making it cost-prohibitive for some pet parents. Veterinarians may prescribe this medication in conjunction with another medication, ketoconazole, which allows a lower dose of cyclosporine and reduces the cost.
"
"While steroids are inexpensive compared with other medications, they have side effects that pet parents may find frustrating. It is very common for dogs on prednisone to drink more, pee more, eat more, and pant more. Weight gain and urinating in the house may become problems.
"
"Azathioprine can have serious side effects, including bone marrow suppression, liver toxicity, and pancreatitis. Regular testing through bloodwork is important to make sure your dog is tolerating the treatment. 
"
"About half of pet patients on this medication show response to treatment. It is often used in combination with oral medications to achieve complete resolution of the fistulas.
"
"Other therapies have been explored, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or stem cell injections and fluorescent light therapy. Talk to your veterinarian about their treatment recommendations for your pet.
"
"Recovery from perianal fistulas is often a long road, but many affected pets live long, good-quality lives. Most pets show improvement after a few weeks of therapy, but treatment is generally lifelong and requires regular monitoring. Recurrence is not uncommon, and pet parents should watch the affected area closely for return of the fistula.
"
"A possible link has been identified between perianal fistulas and food allergies in pets. (This same link has been explored in human patients with irritable bowel syndrome, or IBD, and perianal fistulas.) For long-term management, your veterinarian may recommend a prescription diet of novel or hydrolyzed protein, such as Hills z/d, Royal Canin®/MD HP, or Purina® HA.
"
"Keeping the anal region clean is also important. Regular baths with antibacterial shampoo, like KetoChlor® or Douxo S3™ chlorhexidine antiseptic shampoo, may be recommended.
"
"No. Perianal fistulas will not heal on their own and always require intervention by a veterinarian. If left untreated for a long period of time, they can become very serious and debilitating.
"
"Dogs with well-managed perianal fistulas can live a long and healthy life. While some dogs may experience more severe forms of the disease that may shorten their lifespan, the majority of affected dogs can achieve remission.

"Pemphigus foliaceus is the most common autoimmune skin disease in dogs, although it remains rare.
"
"An autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system—responsible for protecting the body and defending against foreign invaders like bacteria or viruses—becomes dysfunctional.
"
"Instead of fighting off foreign invaders, it starts to attack itself, targeting specific proteins or cells. 
"
"In the case of pemphigus foliaceus, the body targets desmosomes, which are proteins that hold skin cells together. 
"
"This leads to the development of cracks, fissures, pustules (pimples filled with pus), scaling, and infection.
"
"Although it’s not considered a medical emergency, untreated cases of pemphigus foliaceus can result in serious infections, leading to pain and a poor quality of life.
"
"Therefore, treatment should be given as soon as possible. 
"
"Pemphigus foliaceus primarily affects the skin, resulting in a range of skin-related symptoms.
"
"The hallmark symptom is the presence of pustules, which are reddish, yellow, or brown raised lesions, like pimples.
"
"These pustules can occur as single or multiple clusters, which can become much larger, deeper, and more painful with time.
"
"These sores typically appear on the face first and can spread to the head, ears, neck, trunk, groin, and feet. This condition usually has a symmetrical distribution, occurring on both sides of the body.
"
"Other symptoms associated with pemphigus foliaceus in dogs may include:
"
"Scales and crusts on the skin
"
"Hair loss
"
"Itching and scratching (pruritus)
"
"Depigmentation of the nose or lips
"
"Fever
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Weight loss
"
"Pain
"
"While dogs of any breed and age can develop pemphigus foliaceus, it seems to be more prevalent in middle-aged dogs of certain breeds, suggesting a possible genetic component to the disease. These breeds include:
"
"Akitas
"
"Chow Chows
"
"Cocker Spaniels
"
"Collies
"
"Dachshunds
"
"Dobermans
"
"Newfoundlands
"
"Shar-Pei
"
"Pemphigus foliaceus also occurs more frequently in dogs with a history of chronic skin disease, such as allergies and other environmental factors, as well as in dogs with concurrent illness or autoimmune disease. 
"
"Pemphigus foliaceus is primarily classified as an autoimmune disease, and in many cases its cause is idiopathic (unknown).
"
"Some cases have been linked to the use of certain medications, such as antibiotics, and are classified as an adverse drug reaction.
"
"Because symptoms and skin lesions can often be caused by other diseases, your vet will most likely recommend a few basic bedside tests.
"
"These may include:
"
"A skin impression to look for abnormal skin cells and a secondary bacterial and/or yeast infection (pyoderma)
"
"Skin scraping to look for external parasites such as mites
"
"Some type of fungal test (culture/PCR/Wood’s lamp) to look for ringworm
"
"Your vet may also recommend testing your dog’s blood to rule out other conditions and establish a baseline prior to initiating drug therapy.
"
"This may be recommended because the medications prescribed often cause elevated organ values. 
"
"Ultimately, diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus requires a biopsy with histopathology.
"
"This means that your vet may remove several skin samples, often under local sedation or general anesthesia, and submit them for analysis to look for evidence of acantholytic skin cells (skin cells not connected to one another).
"
"Your vet may recommend treatment of the secondary skin infection first for a few days prior to obtaining a biopsy, as pyoderma can complicate the diagnostic process.
"
"There are two treatment goals for all patients with pemphigus foliaceus:
"
"Control the disease.
"
"Induce remission as soon as possible.
"
"Because pemphigus foliaceus occurs due to a dysfunctional immune system, treatment consists of suppressing the immune functions with prescription medications called immunosuppressants.
"
"Steroids, at high doses, are the most prescribed drug and the most effective, but they possess many negative and unappealing side effects, such as:
"
"An increased thirst and urination
"
"Gastrointestinal upset and ulceration
"
"Lethargy
"
"Increased risk of infection
"
"Increased risk of developing certain endocrinopathies (hormone-related disorders)
"
"Toxicity to the liver
"
"Bone marrow suppression
"
"To minimize or avoid these side effects, other immunosuppressive drugs like azathioprine, chlorambucil, mycophenolate, or cyclosporine are used in conjunction with steroids. 
"
"Additionally, steroids and the other drugs are slowly decreased over time, usually after several months, to the lowest effective dose where symptoms are controlled and side effects have ceased. 
"
"It’s important not to discontinue or alter the tapering regimen without speaking with your veterinarian, as symptoms will return, and medical emergencies can appear.
"
"Many dogs with pemphigus foliaceus also suffer from secondary bacterial and fungal infections and will often be prescribed antibiotics such as cephalexin, Clavamox®, or clindamycin, or antifungals such as fluconazole or miconazole.  
"
"Topical therapies, consisting of ointments, shampoos, or conditioners, are often prescribed, containing antibacterial, antifungal, and/or steroidal properties. Bathing your pet, under the direction of your vet, can improve symptoms and help make your dog more comfortable and less itchy.
"
"Fatty acids may improve your pup's skin coat quality, maintain their skin barrier, and reduce inflammation. A few helpful products may include: 
"
"Additionally, diets aimed at strengthening the skin barrier, soothing, and nourishing the skin, and helping to support the immune system, such as Hill’s Derm Defense, could be helpful to your dog. 
"
"Speak with your veterinarian to determine the best topicals, supplements, and diet for your dog based on their specific medical and nutritional needs.
"
"The overall prognosis for dogs with pemphigus foliaceus is fair to good, with improvement generally seen within the first few months of treatment and complete remission of symptoms within about five months. 
"
"Dogs will often need to return for a follow-up visit and stitches removal within the first month.
"
"Monthly (if not more frequent) follow-ups are needed thereafter to ensure that your pup is responding to treatment.
"
"Their vet will also need to monitor their drug levels, check your dog’s blood and organ levels, and consider tapering of medications when needed. 
"
"Unfortunately, not all dogs will fully recover from their symptoms and will require medication for life.
"
"Dogs that respond more quickly to the initial treatment may have a better chance of achieving long-term remission.
"
"It’s important not to discontinue or alter the course of your dog’s medications without speaking with your veterinarian.
"
"If this occurs, this can have significant side effects when not discontinued properly. Additionally, dogs who do go into remission can relapse at any time. 
"
"Because treatment is not without risks and side effects, pay close attention to your dog’s behavior and appetite. Changes can signal the need for medical attention, resulting in a quicker and safer recovery for your pup.
"
"Pemphigus foliaceus can’t be prevented, but adhering to the follow-up recommendations and guidelines of your veterinarian can help prevent recurrences or flare-ups in the future. 
"
"Medications, including vaccinations, should be given with caution, or avoided altogether, as they have the potential to worsen the condition by triggering the immune system.
"
"Pemphigus foliaceus has a varied prognosis, with some studies reporting a 53% success rate for long-term follow-up (seven years from diagnosis).
"
"However, life expectancy with any autoimmune disease can fluctuate depending on remission, recurrence, and comorbidities (additional medical conditions that occur simultaneously).
"
"It’s estimated that euthanasia may be needed in about 13% of cases, especially for those patients with poor quality of life, those who have not responded to appropriate treatment, or those who developed adverse side effects from treatment itself.
"
"Pemphigus foliaceus primarily results from an overactive immune response wherein the body triggers self-destruction of the proteins that keep skin cells together.
"
"Many cases occur spontaneously, but in some instances, the condition is triggered as an adverse reaction to certain medications, such as antibiotics.
"
"Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune disease and is not contagious to other dogs or people.

"Canine parvovirus (CPV, or commonly referred to as “parvo”) is one of the most serious viruses that dogs can get. Thankfully, it is very preventable with proper vaccination.
"
"This virus was discovered in the 1970s and rapidly became a serious threat to canine health. This is primarily because the virus is hard to kill, can live for a long time in the environment, is shed in large quantities by infected dogs, is highly contagious, and is often fatal without appropriate treatment. This is why the parvo vaccine is considered a core vaccine for puppies and dogs.
"
"While the highly effective parvovirus vaccine has decreased the risk to properly vaccinated dogs, parvo in dogs is still widely prevalent, especially in puppies and poorly vaccinated adolescent dogs.
"
"Here’s everything you need to know about parvo in dogs—how to protect your puppy, parvo symptoms to look for, and what to do if you your dog is sick.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Canine parvovirus is an infectious DNA virus that commonly causes severe illness in young and unvaccinated dogs. It primarily affects the body’s rapidly dividing cells, meaning the intestinal tract and bone marrow are the most affected. Heart muscle cells of very young puppies can also be damaged by parvovirus.
"
"Although parvovirus is most common in puppies and adolescent dogs, it can also affect adult or senior dogs, especially if they are unvaccinated.
"
"A dog with parvovirus will usually start to show parvo symptoms within three to seven days of infection. Early signs of parvo include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Lack of appetite
"
"Fever
"
"As the virus progresses, your dog may begin to experience:
"
"Abdominal pain
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Very sick puppies with parvovirus may:
"
"Collapse
"
"Have a high heart rate

"Parvo in dogs is spread by contact with contaminated feces, but you don’t have to see feces for the virus to be present. It can live on surfaces that have been contaminated, including on:
"
"The ground
"
"Kennels
"
"Peoples’ hands
"
"Objects
"
"Clothing
"
"Dogs can also carry parvovirus on their fur or paws if they’ve come in contact with contaminated material.
"
"Parvovirus in dogs is an incredibly contagious disease that spreads quickly and efficiently. Parvovirus can survive in a dog’s environment for months, if not years, and it’s resistant to many disinfectants. However, it is susceptible to diluted bleach and some specialized cleaners commonly used in veterinary hospitals.
"
"Parvovirus is species-specific, so humans have their own version of the virus. This means that humans cannot get parvovirus from dogs, and dogs cannot get parvovirus from people.
"
"However, it’s still important to use the utmost caution by wearing personal protective equipment if you come into contact with a parvo puppy. While you may not get parvo, the virus could be spread to another dog via your hands or clothes.
"
"Fecal SNAP ELISA tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), otherwise called Parvo SNAP tests, are the most common way of diagnosing parvo in dogs and puppies. The test requires a fecal swab and takes about 10 minutes.
"
"While this test is accurate, a negative result does not necessarily rule out parvovirus in a symptomatic dog, as they may not be shedding the viral antigen at the time of testing. Further testing may be needed in these cases.
"
"The stages of canine parvovirus are the same as most viral infections: infection, incubation, and illness.
"
"The puppy (or adult dog) is exposed to parvovirus via fecal material from an infected dog.
"
"Even if there is no visible feces, a dog can be infected by the environment (ground or surface) or an object that came into contact with an infected dog.
"
"There is an incubation period (usually three to seven days) in which the dog is infected with parvovirus but not yet showing symptoms.
"
"During this period, the virus specifically seeks out the most rapidly dividing cells in the body—typically, it starts attacking the tonsils or lymph nodes in the throat. By targeting these rapidly dividing cells, the virus is able to multiply effectively and efficiently to invade other parts of the dog’s system.
"
"Once parvovirus has multiplied and entered the bloodstream, the virus will seek out other sources of rapidly diving cells. The most hard-hit areas are:
"
"Bone marrow
"
"Cells that line the walls of the small intestines
"
"In very young puppies, parvovirus can also infect the heart, which causes inflammation of the heart muscle, poor heart function, and arrhythmias.
"
"When parvovirus infects the bone marrow, it attacks the young immune cells, which leads a drop in protective white blood cells.
"
"This weakens the body’s ability to protect itself and allows the virus to invade the gastrointestinal (GI) tract more easily. This is where the worst damage happens. The virus attacks the lining of the small intestine, which prevents the dog’s GI tract from being able to:
"
"Absorb nutrients
"
"Prevent fluid loss into the stool
"
"Stop bacteria from moving into the gut wall and then into the bloodstream
"
"This leads to serious health issues.
"
"While parvo in dogs is not always fatal, those that do not survive typically die from dehydration or shock—along with the damage caused by the septic toxins from the intestinal bacteria escaping into the bloodstream.
"
"There is no specific cure for parvovirus in dogs, so treatment revolves around supporting the puppy so their body can fight it off.
"
"Supportive care for canine parvovirus generally includes:
"
"Hospitalization with intravenous fluids
"
"Antiemetics to stop vomiting
"
"Focusing on nutrition, with a feeding tube, if necessary
"
"Correction of any electrolyte imbalances or low blood glucose
"
"Some vets may also recommend treatment with a canine parvo monoclonal antibody (CPMA)
"
"Puppies exhibiting signs of sepsis—where the gut becomes so “leaky” from disease that bacteria from the intestines enter the bloodstream—require antibiotic therapy. Puppies with a high fever or low white blood cell count may also receive antibiotics.
"
"The cost of treatment for parvovirus in dogs varies based on the severity of the illness, length of the hospital stay, and location of the veterinary clinic.
"
"Costs could start around several hundred dollars for outpatient treatment and go up to several thousand dollars for a severe case with hospitalization. On average, expect treatment to cost $1,000–$2,100 minimum.
"
"It’s much more cost-effective to have your dog fully vaccinated than to have them contract parvovirus. A parvo vaccine typically costs $30–50.
"
"Recovery from parvovirus in dogs varies case by case. Full recovery may take quite a while depending on the severity of the disease and the damage it has done. Dogs that can recover from infection are often sick for five to 10 days after symptoms begin.
"
"It is very important that puppies with parvovirus receive adequate nutrition so their intestines can heal. Dogs recovering from a parvo infection should be fed a bland, easily digestible diet. Hill’s Science Diet®, Purina®, and Royal Canin® all make prescription veterinary diets that are carefully formulated to be nutritionally balanced and gentle on the GI tract:
"
"Hill’s® Prescription Diet Digestive Care i/d dry dog food
"
"Hill’s® Prescription Diet Digestive Care i/d wet dog food
"
"Purina® Pro Plan® Veterinary Diets EN Gastroenteric dry dog food
"
"Purina® Pro Plan® Veterinary Diets EN Gastroenteric wet dog food
"
"Royal Canin® Veterinary Diet Gastrointestinal Low Fat dry dog food
"
"Royal Canin® Veterinary Diet Puppy Gastrointestinal dry dog food
"
"Royal Canin® Veterinary Diet Gastrointestinal Low Fat wet dog food
"
"Hospital stays generally last around five to seven days, but this varies depending on the severity of symptoms. The highest risk of death occurs around 24–72 hours after you see symptoms of parvo in dogs.
"
"If a parvo puppy is hospitalized, given lots of supportive care, and monitored closely, the survival rate is usually around 85–95%. Survival is more difficult if the dog is not given veterinary attention quickly after showing clinical signs or if the dog is not hospitalized with sufficient supportive care.
"
"Dogs exposed to parvo have an incubation period of three to seven days. During this time, they may start to shed the virus a few days before they show clinical signs. 
"
"Dogs treated for parvo will often need to be hospitalized for five to seven days but may be sick even longer. Most dogs are considered recovered and no longer infectious after 14 days from the onset of the first clinical signs, although in some cases it may be up to 21 days. After being shed, the parvo virus can live in the environment for months or even years.
"
"There are no home remedies for parvo in dogs. In some cases, if a dog is not severely ill or if expensive treatment is prohibitive, then treatment on an outpatient basis may be attempted with help from the vet.
"
"Outpatient treatment for parvo in dogs includes:
"
"Subcutaneous fluids (fluids given under the skin as a source of hydration)
"
"A special, highly digestible diet
"
"Antiemetics to stop vomiting
"
"Antidiarrheals
"
"Antibiotics
"
"While some dogs can recover from this protocol, parvo treatment is much safer and more successful if the dog is hospitalized.
"
"The canine parvo vaccine is most often given in a combination vaccine that goes by a variety of acronyms: DHPP, DAPP, DA2PP, DHLPP, etc. This is considered a core vaccine and should be given every two to four weeks from 6–8 weeks to 16–20 weeks of age.
"
"The most important thing for preventing parvo is making sure you get your puppy in on time for their vaccines.
"
"Puppies should only socialize with fully vaccinated dogs until they are able to be fully vaccinated themselves. Areas where your puppy can come into contact with unvaccinated dogs, such as dog parks, should be avoided.
"
"A dog will need to receive a booster vaccine at 1 year of age to be considered fully vaccinated. Dogs should also continue to receive vaccines every one to three years for life or have their immunity monitored using parvovirus antibody tests.
"
"Yes, dogs and puppies can be successfully treated for parvovirus. They have a much better chance of survival if hospitalized for IV fluids and medications versus those treated with outpatient therapy.  
"
"Initially, a puppy may seem lethargic and disinterested in food. This can progress to vomiting and diarrhea (with or without blood) and fever.
"
"Take your puppy to the vet right away if they are experiencing lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, or diarrhea. The vet will likely start with a parvo test and make a plan from there.
"
"While no vaccine can promise to be 100% effective, the canine parvovirus vaccine provides excellent protection from the virus. It is very unlikely that an appropriately vaccinated dog would become ill with canine parvovirus.
"
"Immunity for parvovirus lasts for several years. While not impossible, it is very unlikely that a dog that has recovered from canine parvovirus would get it again.
"
"However, this does not mean that your dog does not need to be vaccinated against canine parvovirus if they’ve recovered from it in the past. Routine vaccinations should still be performed.
"
"Cats also have a type of parvovirus that causes severe disease, known as feline panleukopenia. While dogs cannot get feline parvovirus from cats, cats can become infected with canine parvovirus. Cats often have much more mild clinical signs than dogs do, but there is a strain of parvo in puppies and dogs that can cause severe illness in cats.
"
"The feline parvovirus vaccine, which is part of the core FVRCP vaccine, may offer some cross-protection against canine parvovirus.

"Pelger-Huët anomaly is an inherited disorder characterized by the hyposegmentation of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell), whereby the nucleus of the cells has only two lobes or no lobes at all. For the most part, this is a harmless disorder which affects several breeds of dogs, including the American foxhound, Australian shepherd, and basenji.
"
"There are two types of this benign defect: heterozygous and homozygous. The heterozygous version is more common and is recognized because the dog's mature neutrophils resemble bands (slightly immature neutrophils) and metamyelocytes (a predecessor of granular leukocytes). Heterozygous anomaly is not associated with immunodeficiency, with predisposition to infection, or with abnormalities of leukocyte (white blood cell) function. Conversely, the homozygous anomaly is usually lethal in utero. Dogs that survive may have leukocytes with round to oval nuclei on a stained blood smear.
"
"Heterozygous anomaly and skeletal anomalies, such as abnormal development of cartilage and shortened jaws, are reported in Samoyeds; however a direct link with Pelger-Huët anomaly has not been conclusively confirmed.
"
"Limited breeding studies may suggest autosomal (non-sex linked) dominant transmission of the anomaly in dogs. However, autosomal dominant transmission with incomplete penetrance (lacks full genetic expression of the autosomal dominance) occurs in Australian shepherd dogs.
"
"In most cases, veterinarians discover the anomaly in your dog by accident while conducting routine blood tests. On a stained blood smear, nuclear hyposegmentation of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes will be visible, whereby the nucleus of the cells has only two lobes or no lobes at all. The hereditary nature of disease is revealed by examination of blood smears from parents and siblings.
"
"
"
"No treatment is required, as there is clinical disease associated with Pelger-Huët anomaly.
"
"If breeding is a concern, genetic counseling can help with eliminating the trait from future generations.

"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a congenital heart defect in dogs, which means that the problem develops in the womb and is present at birth. To appreciate the effects that a PDA has on a dog’s body it’s essential to understand puppy development and some basic anatomy.
"
"In healthy dogs, deoxygenated blood returns from the body to the right side of the heart. Next, this blood goes to the lungs through the pulmonary artery to be reoxygenated, and then it travels back to the left side of the heart. The aorta is the main artery that feeds this oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart to the rest of the body.
"
"In the womb, the fetal aorta is connected to the pulmonary artery by a special blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus. This vessel allows blood to flow directly from the right side of the heart to the aorta, bypassing the lungs. This works in the womb because the fetus gets its oxygen from the mother's bloodstream through the placenta, not through its own lungs.
"
"Normally at birth, this connection is no longer patent (open). Once a newborn has begun to breathe on its own, the ductus arteriosus closes and the pulmonary artery opens so blood can flow from the right side of the heart into the lungs to be oxygenated. But with a patent ductus arteriosis, the connection remains open. Consequently, blood moves in abnormal ways through the heart and lungs. A PDA allows blood to flow directly from the aorta into the pulmonary artery, and then to the lungs. This is called a shunt.
"
"If the shunt is moderate to large, it can cause left-sided congestive heart failure from blood volume overload on the left side of the heart. Less frequently, a large PDA will cause injury to the blood vessels in the lungs because an excessive amount of blood is flowing through them. High blood pressure in the lungs can cause a reversal of the shunt so the blood goes from right to left (pulmonary artery to the aorta).
"
"This atypical right-to-left shunting of a PDA can cause the aorta to carry blood that is low in oxygen to the rest of the body, causing problems including the production of extra red blood cells (since they carry oxygen), making the blood too thick.
"
"The symptoms associated with patent ductus arteriosus in dogs depend on the severity of the abnormality and how long it has been present. In general, some combination of the following is noticeable early in an affected dog’s life:
"
"Left-to-right shunting PDA:
"
"Right-to-left shunting PDA:
"
"Genetics is the primary risk factor for PDA in dogs. Purebred, female dogs are at increased risk. Popular breeds that are predisposed to PDA include:
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, likely followed by a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis to provide general health information. You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.
"
"Visualization of the heart, using radiographs (x-rays) and ultrasound, is necessary for an accurate diagnosis of PDA and to plan appropriate treatment.
"
"With left to right PDAs, surgery will be needed to place a device that will gradually close the abnormal connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Before surgery, a dog’s condition may need to be stabilized using oxygen therapy and medications. It is safe to perform this operation on puppies as young as seven to eight weeks of age. Surgery is not without risks, but many dogs respond beautifully.
"
"Pemphigus in dogs is an autoimmune condition of the skin. When a dog has pemphigus, the connections (desmosomes) between skin cells break down. The destruction of these connections leads to blistering, lesions, hair loss, and redness of the skin.
"
"Autoimmune skin diseases are rare in dogs, but of all these conditions, pemphigus is the most seen. However, most pups won’t ever experience pemphigus.
"
"While a dog with pemphigus may be uncomfortable, in most cases they don’t need to be brought to the emergency room.
"
"If your pet doesn’t seem too bothered by their skin condition, call your veterinarian for an appointment. If your pet is unable to rest due to itchiness or pain, their sores are rapidly worsening, or your pet is lethargic, seek care from an urgent-care veterinarian.
"
"There are five types of pemphigus conditions in dogs, the most common being pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris.
"
"The three rare variants are pemphigus erythematosus, pemphigus vegetans, and paraneoplastic pemphigus. These conditions all have certain characteristics:
"
"Pemphigus foliaceus usually appears on the head, face, and ears with symmetrical lesions on both sides of the head. A dog’s footpads are often affected as well. The trunk of their body is sometimes affected, but it’s not always obvious unless the fur is shaved. Lesions typically look like pustules.
"
"Pemphigus vulgaris is the more severe version of the condition. This form usually affects the mouth and areas where mucous membranes meet the skin, such as the lips, genitals, and anus. Footpads and clawbeds may also be affected. Lesions usually start as blisters and quickly become painful open sores. The lesions of pemphigus vulgaris affect deeper skin layers than pemphigus foliaceus. This type of pemphigus is difficult to resolve. If it does improve, a pup may still have scarring.
"
"Pemphigus erythematosus is considered a crossover between pemphigus foliaceus and another autoimmune skin condition called discoid lupus erythematosus. Commonly affected areas include a dog’s nose, face, and ears, with sores developing in these areas.  Pemphigus erythematosus may be worsened by exposure to the sun.
"
"Pets with a right to left shunting PDA cannot have a surgical correction. Their condition will sometimes respond to medical management for a period of time, but most eventually die as a result of their PDA.
"
"Dogs with a mild to moderate, left to right PDA can be treated normally after they have been allowed several weeks to recover from their surgical correction. Your dog’s surgeon will provide you with individualized recommendations for postoperative care and monitoring.
"
"Because this trait is genetically transmitted, dogs that have had a PDA should not be bred.

"
"Pemphigus vegetans in dogs is very rare. The key characteristic of this form of pemphigus is that lesions develop into wart-like growths.
"
"Paraneoplastic pemphigus occurs as a secondary condition when there’s cancer elsewhere in the body. It’s extremely rare and usually results in a poor outcome for a pup.
"
"A dog's symptoms depend on the type of pemphigus they have. Signs to watch for include:
"
"Hair loss on the nose, ears, and around the eyes.
"
"Blistering, lesions, or crusting on the face, paw pads, within the mouth, or around the genitals.
"
"Blistering, lesions, or crusting on a dog’s body, usually becoming more apparent after shaving.
"
"Itchiness that causes a dog to scratch, lick, or bite themselves.
"
"Lameness, limping, or gait changes (if footpads are affected).
"
"Excessive salivation and bad breath (if lesions are in the mouth).
"
"Fever
"
"Loss of appetite, especially with lesions in the mouth.
"
"Most cases of pemphigus in dogs are considered idiopathic, meaning there isn’t a known cause.
"
"Other cases of pemphigus are thought to have been triggered by reactions to medications the dog takes, topical parasite preventives (like the spot-on you might put between your dog’s shoulder blades to keep fleas and ticks away), or chronic skin diseases like skin allergies (atopy).  
"
"Cancers that have been associated with paraneoplastic pemphigus include lymphoma, thymoma, and a splenic tumor (sarcoma).
"
"Certain breeds are more likely to develop the condition. Pemphigus usually begins in middle-aged to older dogs but it can affect pups of any age.
"
"Any breed can develop pemphigus foliaceous, but the two most at-risk breeds are:
"
"Akitas
"
"Chow Chows
"
"Breeds at-risk for pemphigus erythematosus include:
"
"Collies
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Diagnosis of pemphigus usually involves cytology (examination of cells under a microscope) and biopsy (examination of tissue sample under a microscope) of an active lesion.
"
"Cytology can help determine if there is infection, which frequently occurs as a secondary condition. Many veterinarians perform cytology tests at their offices, but some may send the sample to a pathologist, a scientist who interprets laboratory samples.
"
"Your veterinarian may take a culture (a test to find germs) from a lesion on your pup to ensure that the antibiotics given are working. Cultures are usually performed by an off-site laboratory and it may take several days to get results.
"
"Biopsy samples are then sent to a pathology lab for a final diagnosis. Some vets will perform a biopsy under general anesthesia while others may do light sedation and local anesthesia. This may also depend on the severity of a dog’s condition and where the lesions are located on their body.
"
"Before any medications are given to your dog, your vet will perform routine bloodwork. Be sure to disclose this information to your vet before treatment begins:
"
"Any medications your pet is currently taking
"
"Changes to parasite preventives or diet
"
"Any history of skin conditions
"
"Because pemphigus is considered an autoimmune condition, the goal of treatment is to suppress the immune system. Your dog may be referred to a veterinary dermatologist to continue their care.
"
"The most common medication used to treat pemphigus is a steroid given by mouth, usually prednisone or prednisolone. Steroids are typically tapered to the lowest effective dose. Some vets may give injectable steroids like dexamethasone at the start of your pup’s treatment. If steroids aren’t effective, an immunosuppressant called azathioprine is usually added to treatment. Like steroids, azathioprine is tapered over time.
"
"Chlorambucil and cyclosporine are two alternative immunosuppressants that may be used instead of azathioprine.  
"
"A topical steroid like triamcinolone can be placed on lesions when treating pemphigus foliaceus or pemphigus erythematosus. Once effective control is achieved, treatment may be changed to a topical hydrocortisone.
"
"If your pup develops a skin infection, they will receive oral antibiotics such as cephalexin or cefpodoxime. If your vet has taken a culture of one of your dog’s lesions, antibiotics will be based on culture results.
"
"Pemphigus can be put into remission (signs and symptoms will disappear) but isn’t usually cured, and many patients require lifelong medical management to remain in remission.
"
"Treatment is usually effective for pemphigus foliaceus, even in severe cases. Most dogs with less severe pemphigus improve within two to six weeks of starting treatment.
"
"However, most patients with pemphigus vulgaris are humanely euthanized due to their condition, even with aggressive treatment.
"
"Suppression of the immune system isn’t without side effects. Dogs on lifelong steroids can develop Cushing’s disease or get urinary tract infections. Dogs being treated for pemphigus should have checkups at least every six months with their vet.
"
"For dogs with pemphigus, avoid sunlight, especially during warmer months. Pet-safe sunscreens may be helpful, though care should be taken to avoid getting the sunscreen into their eyes.
"
"Most dogs with pemphigus should continue year-round parasite prevention. Fleas can significantly worsen your dog’s discomfort by causing itchiness, secondary infections, and allergic reactions. Speak with your vet about the preventative you are using for your dog.
"
"Pemphigus isn’t a preventable condition.
"
"Dogs with milder forms of pemphigus—such as pemphigus foliaceus or pemphigus erythematosus—can live normal lives with good management of their condition.
"
"Dogs that don’t respond sufficiently to treatment are often humanely euthanized due to their condition within a year of diagnosis.
"
"Some forms of pemphigus are naturally worse, such as pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus can be exacerbated by secondary issues (skin infection), sun exposure, or an ineffective treatment plan.

"Neospora caninum is a parasite similar in form to Toxoplasma gondii. Under microscopic examination, the N. caninum sporozoite (the body of the parasite) closely resembles the T. gondii sporozoite, and the the two diseases share many of the same symptoms. However, the N. caninum infection has a more severe impact on a dog's neurological and muscular system than T. gondii does.
"
"This infection naturally leads to the development of neosporosis, the medical term for a diseased state that has been caused by the death of cells and living tissue (an incident known as necrosis) in response to the invasion of N. caninum. It is associated with tissue damage from the rupture of a cyst and subsequent invasion of tachyzoite microorganisms – the stage at which the sporozoite organism multiplies rapidly in the tissues throughout the body.
"
"The life cycle of the N. caninum parasite is unknown, but it known to be transmissible during fetal development and birth. Puppies are most commonly diagnosed, but hunting dogs are also at increased risk and appear frequently in the medical literature covering this condition.
"
"Signs of neosporosis are similar to the parasitic disease toxoplasmosis, which is caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. In dogs less than six months of age, symptoms usually include stiffness of the pelvic limbs (back legs), paralysis distinguished by gradual muscle atrophy (in which the muscles seize up and cannot move), progressing to rigid contracting of the limbs.
"
"In older dogs, the central nervous system is more likely to be involved, leading to symptoms such as seizures, tremors, behavioral changes, and blindness. Other symptoms that may develop include weakness of the cervical muscles (near to the neck) and difficulty swallowing, a condition known as dysphagia. These signs develop gradually. The eventual paralysis of the muscles involved in respiration can lead to death. In many cases, the infection spreads throughout the body, affecting most of the organs, including the skin. Dermatitis is another common symptom of neosporosis, particularly in older dogs.
"
"Neosporosis is caused by the protozoan Neospora caninum, which invades and inhabits the body of the host animal. Dogs and coyotes are definitive hosts of N. caninum and can pass on infection via the sporulated oocysts (the fertilized ovum of the N. caninum parasite) present in their feces. Ingestion of these oocysts – for example, in contaminated food stuffs – can pass on neosporosis to animals. Additionally, the presence of N. caninum cysts in the tissues of an intermediate host (such as cattle) can lead to the contamination of feeds, leading to infection.
"
"Transmission of N. caninum also may be transplacental, meaning it may be transmitted from mother to child through the placenta while the fetus is still in the womb. This can result in congenital infection (in which the infection is present upon birth). In puppies, N. caninum may form cysts in the developing central nervous system, resulting in neurological abnormalities.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, including a complete blood profile, a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. A fecal sample will also be necessary for laboratory analysis. A finding of oocysts in the feces will be definitive for diagnosing neosporosis. Your doctor will also need to perform an analysis of your dog's cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid of the brain and spinal cord) in order to determine the extent of neurological involvement. Changes, such as a slight increase in protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, are indicative of neosporosis. I tissue biopsy may also be used to differentiate N. caninum from T. gondii.
"
"Because there are several conditions that can cause central nervous system dysfunctions, your doctor may also need to rule these out, especially those that have the highest risk for severe complications. Some of the diseases your doctor may want to rule out, depending on the background of symptoms and the environment your dog normally lives in, include rabies, fungal infections, meningitis, and reactions to toxic materials (e.g., lead, pesticides).
"
"
"
"Certain medications may be given for the treatment of neosporosis, and may stop the progression of the disease and its symptoms. However, prognosis for patients is poor when the disease has reached the point where muscles have begun to contract and progressive paralysis has set in.
"
"Neosporosis must be treated with the appropriate medications, as prescribed by your veterinarian, for an extended period of time. It is important to administer medications properly for the entire recommended time period.
"
"Neosporis may be prevented by avoiding contaminated feeds. Other dogs or cattle that may have had contact with an infected animal should be tested for neosporosis and receive treatment as soon as possible, before the parasite has an opportunity to become systemic.

"Respiratory parasites can be classified as worms, or as insects such as maggots or mites that live in the respiratory system. They can be found in the passages of the respiratory tract or in the blood vessels, including the upper respiratory tract (nose, throat, and windpipe), or the lower respiratory passage (bronchi, lungs).
"
"Such parasites can affect all of the host’s systems: the respiratory system, the cardiovascular system (the heart), the circulatory system and the endocrine system (the liver and kidneys).
"
"Households with multiple pets, and dwellings in which animals are living in unsanitary conditions have a higher risk of transmission. Exposure to the infected feces of other animals that are carriers of the parasite can also make an animal more susceptible. This can include being in an environment such as a shelter or boarding facility, but your dog is also more at risk if it goes outdoors frequently, as it has more opportunities to come into contact with other animals and their feces and urine. Sporting dogs are also at increased risk, due to exposure to wild animals and their droppings in wooded areas, and to water borne parasites in rivers and lakes.
"
"These parasites often begin their life cycles in shellfish, crabs, lizards, and worms, spreading to other animals opportunistically.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health and recent activities, including recent history of boardings, outings, and experiences with other animals or with pests. Your veterinarian will then perform a complete physical exam on your dog. Standard laboratory work will include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis in order to determine the exact origin of the symptoms. A differential diagnosis may find parasites, but it may also find a bacterial respiratory infection.
"
"Your veterinarian will specifically examine your dog's urine and feces for parasite eggs or pieces of parasites. In feces, these are found by microscopically examining a solution of your dog's feces. A sample of sputum (cough discharge) can also be microscopically examined for parasite eggs.
"
"X-ray imaging of the lungs is crucial for visualizing abnormal lung changes that may be indicative of a parasitic infestation. A rhinoscopy or bronchoscopy (direct visualization of the nose and bronchioles with a small camera) is an even better way to look for respiratory parasites.
"
"
"
"Patients with respiratory parasites are usually treated on an outpatient basis with dewormers.  Anti-inflammatory agents are also given to the patients to decrease their body’s negative immune reaction to so many dead parasites. In some cases, the parasites can only be removed surgically one at a time.
"
"If your dog is having trouble breathing, it should be hospitalized and given oxygen therapy until the parasite infestation has been resolved.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to examine your dog's respiratory passages with a bronchoscope and to reexamine fecal and urine samples for parasite eggs.  Preventing your dog from eating insects, rodents, and wild animals is the best way of protecting your dog against parasite infections. Also, avoiding contact with unknown cats and dogs, or even separating your own pets (if you have others) when they appear to be ill are some ways in which you can prevent or mitigate a parasitic infection.
"
"There may be some more preventive methods for avoiding parasites. If your dog is a sporting dog, or if you live in a wooded area, or near a body of water, talk to your veterinarian about the local parasites and what you can do to protect your dog from an infestation.
"
"Most animals recover well from respiratory parasites, unless the infection has been chronic (long term). If parasites have migrated to the brain, causing your dog to show symptoms of neurological impairment, a cure will not be possible.
"
"If you suspect that your dog is infected with parasites, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible. If your dog has already begun to show symptoms of  neurological change or degeneration, call your veterinarian for an emergency appointment.

"The mycoplasma is a class of bacterial parasites belonging to the order of Mollicutes. They are able to survive without oxygen, and lack true cell walls, making them resistant to antibiotics and therefore a greater challenge to detect and treat. They are the most common cause of urinary tract infections and pneumonia.
"
"Hemotrophic mycoplasmosis is the result of infection of the red blood cells by the mycoplasma parasite M. haemocanis. Dogs usually will not show signs of illness or suffer from severe anemia (lack of red blood cells) with this kind of infection unless they have had their spleens removed (splenectomy). Since the purpose of the spleen is to filter and remove damaged red blood cells, the lack of this organ allows the mycoplasma to take a stronger hold in the system, and the body suffers systemically from the overload of damaged blood cells.
"
"The mycoplasma bacteria is transmitted mainly by ticks and fleas that have fed off of other infected animals. It is also spread through fighting between animals (body fluid exchange); and rarely, from blood transfusion - where infected blood from one animal is transfused to an uninfected animal. Transmission of the mycoplasma from a mother to her young (typically through milk) is not yet proven to take place with dogs.
"
"M. haemocanis (previously classified as H. canis) is the main type of mollicute that causes this condition.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and recent activities. A complete blood chemical profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and a blood smear. The blood smear will be stained to identify the mycoplasmas in the blood. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, or a Coombs’ test, may also be used by your veterinarian to positively identify the presence of mycoplasmas.
"
"
"
"If this disease is caught early, your dog will more than likely be treated with antibiotics and sent home. Depending on the severity of th einfection, your veterinarian will prescribe either a standard or long course of antibiotics for your dog. If anemia is also present you may also need to go with a course of steroid therapy. In most cases, only severely anemic, or very ill and listless dogs will be hospitalized. Fluid therapy, and possibly even blood transfusions, will be necessary to stabilize your dog if the condition has progressed to a severe stage. Left untreated, this disease can have fatal results.
"
"Your dog will need to be checked by your veterinarian for progress within a week of treatment, when a red blood cell count will be performed to examine for mycoplasma levels. An infected dog can remain a carrier of the disease even after complete recovery. If you have other dogs in the home you will need to monitor them for possible symptoms and act quickly if symptoms do appear. In addition, breeding of affected dogs should be avoided until your veterinarian has given you the all clear.
"
"The condition or disease described in this article can affect both dogs and cats (though it is not communicable between the two species). If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD Pet Health Library.

"Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi) is a protozoal parasitic infection in dogs which spreads and creates lesions on the lungs, heart, kidneys, and brain, significantly effecting their ability to function normally. This disease is also commonly called microsporidiosis, as the E. cuniculi is a parasite belonging to the species of microsporidia.
"
"It is a relatively rare infection in dogs, and is better known for its effects on rabbit populations. Microsporidial infection appears to be acquired by the oronasal (mouth and nose) route, when an animal licks/sniffs the spore-infected urine of another animal. For this reason, animals that are kenneled are at greater risk for it. However, because microsporidia can survive for extended periods in the environment, it is reasonable to assume that almost any dog that goes outdoors is susceptible to infection.
"
"Treatment is experimental, with supportive therapy being the most dominant treatment. In most cases infected dogs will recover fully without medical treatment, but it is often fatal when acquired by puppies (most often while developing in the womb, or while nursing). Puppies may be stillborn, or will die while young from failure to thrive.
"
"In addition, this parasitic infection is zoonotic and therefore contagious to humans, particularly those who are immunocompromised. Sanitizing the environment is essential; a 70 percent ethanol solution should be used to clean up any infected urine and throughout the dog's living area.
"
"Neonatal 	infection (appears around three weeks of age)
"
"Adults
"
"   
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical exam of your dog after taking a complete history from you. You will then need to provide as much background information as possible about your dog's health and all of the symptoms leading up to the visit. If your dog has recently given birth, or you have puppies being treated, the puppies may be very small with a poor, dull-looking hair coats.
"
"Because some dogs exhibit uncharacteristic aggression, your veterinarian may want to test for rabies and distemper as well. If your dog is an adult, it may have limited vision, complete blindness, or it may be having occasional seizures. Your veterinarian will order a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count and a urinalysis to see which organs the parasite has infected. The infectious spores can be seen in urine that has been stained to make the spores visible under a microscope.
"
"
"
"Many dogs will completely recover by themselves if the infection has not progressed to severe kidney or brain disease. Supportive therapy can be used along with a fungicidal drug until the infection has cleared from the body. If your dog has severe brain or kidney disease it may need to be euthanized.
"
"Avoid all urine from a dog that is sick with this disease.  If possible, you might want to opt to keep your dog at the veterinary clinic until its urine is no longer infectious. If you do keep your dog at home, make sure to keep it in an enclosed area on a slick, easy to sanitize surface. This will allow you to pour the 70 percent ethanol solution over your dog's urine to kill the spores (should it get on the floor). Disposable floor coverings and blankets/sheets may be used to help make cleanup more thorough.
"
"Immune-compromised people are most at risk for catching this disease from their pets, so if at all possible, these people should have someone else to take care of their dogs until they are no longer infectious, or take all necessary precautions to protect themselves while caring for their pets (e.g., face masks, disposable gloves).

"Sudden onset of the inability to close the jaw owing to dysfunction of the mandibular (jaw) branch of the trigeminal nerves (one of the cranial nerves) is a treatable medical condition called trigeminal nerve neuritis (inflammation). This is often due to nerve injury, which ranges from neuritis, demyelination (loss of the fatty sheath around the nerve which helps conduct the signal), and sometimes to fiber degeneration of all the branches of the trigeminal nerve and the nerve cell body.
"
"Although it is occasionally seen in cats, trigeminal neuritis is mainly an illness of dogs.
"
" 
"
" 
"
" 
"
" 
"
"The underlying cause of trigeminal nerve neuritis is currently uknown, though it is possibly immune-mediated.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background medical history, onset of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases. Rabies is one of the more important disease conditions that will need to be ruled out. Diagnostic imaging like X-ray will be used to examine the skull and jaw bones, and bone marrow core biopsies and muscle biopsies can be used to rule out other possibilities for disease.  
"
"Paraphimosis occurs when a dog is unable to retract his penis into the loose sheath of skin that protects it, known as the prepuce.
"
"Paraphimosis is diagnosed when the penis is stuck outside of the prepuce for more than two hours. This condition differs from priapism, which occurs when the penis is erect for more than two hours. 
"
"Once a dog’s penis becomes stuck, the tissues of the penis swell and it becomes even more difficult to retract.
"
"The exposed, sensitive mucosal tissue on the surface of the penis quickly becomes dry and painful. Dogs often respond by excessively licking the irritated tissue, which causes more damage.
"
"Dogs with paraphimosis are unable to mate, as mating can significantly damage the tissues of an affected penis.
"
"If your dog has paraphimosis, you can try to clean the area with gentle soap and warm water. Pet parents can also apply a sterile lubricant that could help ease your dog’s penis back into the sheath.
"
"Even if you are successful in doing so, it's important that your dog have a checkup with their vet as soon as possible. This is to ensure there’s not any internal damage and that it won’t happen again.
"
"Paraphimosis is painful and is considered a medical emergency. Paraphimosis should be immediately treated by your dog’s veterinarian or an emergency veterinary hospital. Waiting to treat this condition can cause dire consequences.
"
"Some signs of paraphimosis in dogs include:
"
"Excessive licking of the exposed penis (this is often the only sign)
"
"Visible swelling and redness of the penis
"
"Paralysis—the inability to move one or more limbs—occurs in dogs when the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and muscles don’t communicate properly with one another to produce normal body movements.
"
"Nerve receptors normally receive these messages and send them along the spinal cord to the brain.
"
"The brain then sends a message back down the spinal cord to nerves that travel to the muscles, telling them to move the limb. 
"
"Depending on the underlying cause, a dog’s legs can be partially paralyzed (paresis) or completely paralyzed.
"
"Paralysis can affect only the back legs, only the front legs, or all four limbs (tetraplegia).
"
"Front-leg paralysis is often associated with injury to the nerve roots in the neck and shoulder, or those that originate at the brachial plexus in the armpit.
"
"Hind-leg paralysis originates from injury to a dog’s lower back or tailbone, or the nerves located between the spinal cord and the hind legs (lumbosacral plexus).
"
"Damage to one of these areas interrupts communication between the nerves, brain, and spinal cord, causing paralysis or paresis. Nerve trauma is the most common cause of leg paralysis in dogs.
"
"
"
" 
"
"The most effective treatment is supportive care. Your dog will need assistance with eating and drinking. If you are able to provide sufficient care at home, your dog may be treated as an outpatient, but if you cannot care for your dog, it will need supportive nutritional care in the veterinary hospital so that it is receiving adequate nutrients. 
"
" 
"
"If your dog is still able to lap and swallow food that is offered, you can use a large syringe that is placed in the corner of the mouth to feed the dog water and pureed foods, with the dog's head slightly elevated so that it can swallow easily. Fluids can also be administered subcutaneously (under the skin). Feeding tubes are rarely necessary for maintaining adequate food intake, but may be used if your dog is unable to take anything into the mouth or swallow the food that is given.  
"
" 
"
" 
"
"This disease usually spontaneously resolves after 2-4 weeks. One result of this disease is shrinkage of the muscles used for chewing. Once the condition has stabilized and your dog is able to move its jaws normally again, you can help your dog to strengthen the jaw muscles. Your veterinarian will recommend exercises for doing this based on your dog's overall health and age.

"Abnormal penile discharge
"
"Urine dribbling
"
"Trouble urinating
"
"Edema or fluid accumulation in the tissues surrounding the penis
"
"Posthitis (swelling of the foreskin)
"
"If your dog’s penis is stuck outside the sheath and you are unable to reduce it, they must be evaluated by a veterinarian right away.
"
"Paraphimosis isn’t common in dogs who naturally mate. This condition typically occurs after a dog has an erection after manual semen collection for breeding purposes.
"
"Commonly, matted hair forms a ring around the base of a dog’s penis that cuts off blood flow. This ring acts as a tourniquet, and as a result, the dog’s penis and surrounding tissues become swollen.
"
"Additional causes of paraphimosis include:
"
"Edges of the penile sheath rolling inward
"
"Foreign objects or materials stuck in the sheath
"
"Infection
"
"Trauma, such as fracture of the os penis (the penis bone)
"
"Neurologic disease
"
"Muscle weakness
"
"Priapism
"
"Cancer
"
"Although any male dogs can develop paraphimosis, it’s more common in unneutered male dogs since the condition is typically triggered by ejaculation.
"
"If your dog is not walking normally or you suspect that they are paralyzed, this is a medical emergency. Your dog should be examined immediately by their veterinarian or at the nearest veterinary emergency hospital.
"
"That visit is crucial, as paralysis often worsens quickly, along with the likelihood of your dog regaining normal bodily function.
"
"Symptoms of paralysis in dogs include:
"
"Inability to move all four legs
"
"Inability to move the hind legs (paraplegia)
"
"Inability to flex the joints in affected limbs
"
"Lack of full-limb control (paresis)
"
"Dragging the hind legs
"
"Knuckling or tripping over the paws
"
"Weakness
"
"Loss of muscle mass
"
"Neck pain, characterized by holding the head down, front-leg lameness, and reluctance to move the head or jump
"
"Spinal pain or leg pain
"
"Lack of pain response in the paws
"
"Limp tail
"
"Limping or abnormal gait
"
"Inability to urinate or dribbling urine
"
"Inability to have bowel movements or fecal incontinence
"
"Constipation
"
"Horner’s syndrome on the same side of the body as a paralyzed front leg, characterized by a small pupil, partially closed eyelid, and third eyelid prominence
"
"A dog can become partially or completely paralyzed for many reasons.
"
"Trauma, such as being hit by a car, is the most common cause of paralysis in dogs.
"
"Although paralysis can occur in any dog breed and at any age, some breeds are more prone to medical conditions that might lead to paralysis, such as:
"
"Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) — IVDD results from protrusion of disc material between the spinal bones, which causes spinal cord compression. Dachshunds, Basset Hounds, and other dogs with long backs are predisposed to IVDD.
"
"Degenerative myelopathy (DM) — DM is a genetic condition that causes destruction of the nerves that originate from the spinal cord. Older dogs and German Shepherds, Boxers, Welsh Corgis, and Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are prone to this condition.
"
"Fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE) — An FCE, or spinal stroke, occurs when a piece of cartilage from an injured vertebral disc enters the bloodstream and lodges in a spinal artery, blocking blood flow to a section of the spinal cord.
"
"This condition is more common in large and giant breeds, such as Labrador Retrievers and Bernese Mountain Dogs; however, small breeds such as Miniature Schnauzers and Yorkshire Terriers have a high incidence as well.
"
"Genetics may also play a role. Bouvier des Flandres, German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers are the most commonly affected breeds.
"
"Some dogs may be born with a narrow sheath opening, while others may have sustained an injury or disease that leads to paraphimosis.
"
"Paraphimosis is often diagnosed with a physical examination and the taking of a dog’s medical history. Your vet should be able to visualize the issue without diagnostic testing.
"
"However, a urinalysis and biopsy of the affected penile tissues may be needed if there’s an abnormality of the penis, such as the presence of a growth, or if your vet suspects an infection.
"
"If a fracture of the os penis is suspected, an X-ray may be indicated.
"
"Paraphimosis can easily be treated by your veterinarian if it’s caught early and your dog is seen before severe swelling and pain develops.
"
"If paraphimosis has just occurred and minimal swelling is present, you can apply dog-safe lubrication and gentle pressure to help reposition the penis into its sheath. However, most cases of paraphimosis must be treated by a veterinarian.
"
"Your vet may place an intravenous (IV) catheter into your dog in their lower front leg. They will administer pain medication or sedation before correcting the paraphimosis.
"
"They will gently clean your dog’s penis and prepuce and clip the surrounding fur. They will then apply a lubricant to the exposed penis and attempt to move it back into the sheath.
"
"If the penis does not retract easily, a sugar solution, cold compress, or pressure with a gloved hand can be used to help reduce the swelling before replacement is attempted again.
"
"If your dog’s penis will not remain in the sheath once it’s retracted, a special suture technique called a purse string can be used to keep the penis in the prepuce.
"
"Severe cases of paraphimosis may require general anesthesia and a surgical procedure to correct the issue and ensure that your dog’s urethra (the tube that takes urine from the bladder and is emptied outside the body) is not affected. If the urethra is affected, a urinary catheter will be placed while the urethra heals.
"
"If a dog’s paraphimosis is due to an anatomical anomaly, such as a small preputial opening, reconstructive surgery can be performed. This will create a larger opening for your dog and prevent paraphimosis from happening again. 
"
"After paraphimosis correction, your dog will need to wear a comfy collar until they have completely healed to prevent them from licking the area.
"
"Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat any infection present or to prevent infection from developing. Anti-inflammatory and pain medications may also be prescribed.
"
"If surgery was performed, suture removal will be needed approximately 10 to 14 days after your pup’s procedure.
"
"There are a few things you can do to prevent paraphimosis in your dog:
"
"Additional causes of paralysis in dogs include:
"
"Tick paralysis
"
"Distemper virus infection
"
"Rabies virus infection
"
"Fungal diseases
"
"Nervous system inflammation or infection (viral or bacterial)
"
"Infection or inflammation of the muscles (polymyositis)
"
"Inflammation of the nerves (polyneuritis)
"
"Blocked spinal blood vessel (embolus)
"
"Blocked blood flow to the rear legs (aortic embolus)
"
"A tumor or cancer in the brain or spinal cord
"
"Botulism bacterial toxin
"
"Myasthenia gravis (a disorder that causes extreme muscle weakness)
"
"Hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone)
"
"Genetic malformation of the spine or vertebral column
"
"Severe or chronic exposure to pesticides or insecticides, especially organophosphates, which can cause disruption to the nervous system
"
"If your dog is paralyzed or is showing signs of partial paralysis, your vet will perform a complete physical exam, including checking their neurologic reflexes.
"
"Part of the neurologic exam will assess your dog’s limbs, head, legs, and back for pain or lack of a normal pain response.
"
"It’s important to share all information with your vet about your dog’s health, including any possible injuries and any travel or tick exposure they may have had.
"
"Your vet may also perform bloodwork, including a complete blood count and chemistry panel, and urinalysis. These tests will detect inflammation, infection, or the presence of a tick-transmitted disease.
"
"While X-rays may be helpful initially to look for spinal abnormalities, a CT scan or MRI will provide a more detailed picture of your dog’s brain and spine.
"
"A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may also be taken by your vet to look for signs of inflammation or infection.
"
"Results of these preliminary tests could indicate a need for a biopsy of the muscle or nerve.
"
"Electrical nerve stimulation can be used to determine the exact location of a nerve injury, and to determine the injury’s extent or assess function of the injured nerve.
"
"It’s extremely important to determine the exact location of the problem, because the closer a nerve injury is to the muscle, the better the chance for recovery from paralysis.
"
"Depending on the underlying cause of your dog’s paralysis, they may require hospitalization with intensive care.
"
"Paralyzed dogs are often hospitalized during the diagnostic period because spinal X-rays, CT scans, MRI, CSF collection, and biopsies require anesthesia.
"
"Nerves can regenerate after an injury, but it is a slow process (1 inch per month), and return to full function is determined by exactly locating the nerve injury.
"
"Keep the hair around their prepuce short and free from debris.
"
"Ensure your dog’s genitalia is clean and lubricated before breeding.
"
"Clean your dog’s penis and prepuce after breeding or semen collection.
"
"Inspect your dog’s penis and prepuce regularly to ensure there are no issues. This can be part of your bathing and grooming routine.
"
"Paraphimosis in dogs can be treated easily if caught early. While this condition can occur in any male dog, pups that are bred are usually most affected and should be monitored very closely when doing so.
"
"Remember—even if you can get your dog’s penis back into the sheath, a vet visit is always recommended to ensure your dog has a full recovery.
"
"A dog can't live with untreated paraphimosis, as it will cause significant pain and death of the penile tissue over time.
"
"Infection can also develop and spread throughout the body, causing severe illness and life-threatening sepsis.
"
"Paraphimosis correction rarely occurs without intervention from a vet. If your dog’s penis is stuck outside of its sheath for more than two hours, they must have medical treatment immediately.

"There’s not much your vet can do to assist nerve regeneration, although laser therapy and acupuncture have shown some promise in helping to speed up the process.
"
"Anti-inflammatory medications such as carprofen or prednisone may be prescribed if swelling is present.
"
"Muscle-relaxing medications such as methocarbamol may be used, especially in dogs with IVDD.
"
"Pain medications are also important to keep affected dogs comfortable—mild pain can be controlled with oral medications while severe pain will require hospitalization for intravenous (IV) medications.
"
"If your dog is unable to urinate or is having trouble urinating, they will need a urinary catheter placed to empty their bladder while they are hospitalized.
"
"Dogs with IVDD or certain tumors can undergo surgery to decompress the affected areas and at times, limb function can be restored.
"
"The likelihood of a dog returning to full function depends on the cause of their paralysis.
"
"Horner's syndrome indicates that a nerve root has been torn and the chance of recovery from this type of paralysis is unlikely.
"
"However, if your dog has some voluntary movement of their limb(s), along with pain sensation and the presence of spinal reflexes over the first one to two months, their prognosis for recovery is better.
"
"Dogs that have lost the ability to urinate will require bladder expression at home on a regular basis.
"
"Your vet will teach you how to safely express your dog’s bladder. Wearing a doggy diaper will help keep dogs with fecal incontinence clean.
"
"During the recovery process, it is crucial that a paralyzed dog wear a protective cone to avoid self-harm. If your dog has pain or lacks sensation in the limb(s), they may chew or bite the area, making the collar important in their recovery.
"
"If there is no movement or sensation in the affected limb in three to six months, amputation may be the best option to give your dog the best quality of life. Your vet can advise you on what is best for your pup.
"
"Proper nursing care of paralyzed dogs is important to prevent pressure sores. Techniques to keep the dog as comfortable as possible include:
"
"Always keeping them on a soft surface.
"
"Rotating their position.
"
"Applying heat and massage.
"
"Using a sling to walk them.
"
"Using a sling or long, soft cloth passed under your dog’s belly and held up on either side of the body, assist your pup while walking by carrying some of their body weight for them.
"
"Your dog might be a candidate for a special wheelchair to assist them in maintaining mobility while paralyzed.
"
"Dogs can adapt well to being paralyzed. With proper care given by an attentive pet parent, they can live a long, happy, healthy life.
"
"Ensuring that your dog is always supervised can help prevent any possible injury or trauma that could cause paralysis.
"
"Vaccination is also crucial to help prevent viral diseases, such as distemper and rabies, that can cause paralysis.
"
"It is also important to keep your dog on year-round tick prevention to help protect them against tick paralysis.
"
"Screening breeding dogs for genetic conditions like myasthenia gravis and degenerative myelopathy can also help prevent their puppies from developing paralysis in the future.

"Pannus—also referred to as chronic superficial keratitis—is a non-painful eye condition in dogs that affects the cornea.
"
"The cornea is the thin outer layer of the eye that provides protection and focuses light so that dogs can see. In most dogs who have pannus, both eyes are affected.
"
"German Shepherds, Siberian Huskies, Australian Shepherds, and sighthounds have an increased risk of developing this condition, likely due to genetics. It’s most common in middle-aged dogs but tends to be most severe in younger dogs or those who live at high altitudes, due to increased ultraviolet (UV) light exposure.
"
"Pannus in dogs occurs when the immune system’s inflammatory cells settle onto the cornea and form small, raised bumps alongside blood vessels.
"
"These abnormalities first develop on the edges of the cornea and spread inward. The condition can range in severity depending on the dog’s age as well as environmental factors. In chronic cases, the cornea becomes darker in color and scarred.
"
"Pannus is a slowly progressive disease that, if left untreated, can cause blindness in dogs.
"
"While pannus is not considered a medical emergency, it’s important for dogs to receive treatment promptly to preserve vision and improve their response to treatment.
"
"Symptoms of pannus in dogs may include:
"
"Raised bumps on the cornea
"
"Blood vessels spreading across the cornea
"
"A darkening in the color of the cornea
"
"Red and inflamed eyes
"
"Eye discharge, such as mucus
"
"Squinting
"
"Pawing at the eyes
"
"Blindness
"
"Chronic superficial keratitis is an immune-mediated condition.
"
"This means that a dog’s immune system inappropriately attacks its own body—in this case, the cornea—resulting in inflammation and progressive damage.
"
"There may also be an underlying genetic component, as specific breeds, primarily German Shepherds, have a higher incidence of the disease.
"
"A veterinarian will start with a thorough physical exam to check the dog’s overall health.
"
"A complete eye exam will be done, which can identify changes to the cornea consistent with pannus. Typically, this is enough to diagnose the disease, but other tests may be done to rule out other eye conditions that can cause similar symptoms.
"
"These tests may include:
"
"Schirmer tear test: This test measures tear production in the eyes. When tear production is reduced, eyes can become red and inflamed and produce a mucoid discharge.
"
"Fluorescein stain: Using a green fluorescein stain, a veterinarian can detect corneal ulcers, which can develop due to trauma or underlying disease.
"
"Tonometry: This test is used to measure eye pressure, which can be abnormal in response to diseases, such as glaucoma or uveitis.
"
"Pet parents should discuss with their veterinarian when symptoms started and any medications the pet is currently taking.
"
"Treatment of pannus in dogs consists of topical immunosuppressive medications.
"
"They are generally applied to a dog's eyes up to four times daily and may be used alone or in combination, depending on the dog’s needs.
"
"Options may include:
"
"Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or prednisolone
"
"Cyclosporine
"
"Tacrolimus
"
"Severe cases of pannus may benefit from steroid injections beneath the conjunctiva (the pink tissue surrounding the eye). Less commonly, surgery may be beneficial to improve vision.
"
"German Shepherds who are diagnosed at a young age generally have pannus that is less responsive to treatment, as these cases tend to be more severe.
"
"Pet parents should be aware that the condition can be managed but not cured. Treatment is required for the remainder of the dog’s life.
"
"Some cases may require referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist for more advanced treatment options.
"
"While pannus in dogs is treatable, it's not curable.
"
"Dogs must continue to receive treatment for the remainder of their lives to keep the disease from progressing. If caught early, response to treatment is generally good.
"
"Dogs living at lower altitudes have less severe disease and respond more favorably as well.
"
"Most affected dogs have noticeable improvement with prompt treatment, but the time frame varies in each case.  
"
"The goal for treatment is to use the smallest dosage of medication to keep symptoms at bay. Ideally, dogs would require only one topical medication long-term, such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine, but it may be necessary to continue a combination of these in some dogs.
"
"Pet parents should follow the veterinarian’s instructions closely regarding medications and bring their dog to all follow-up appointments to ensure the disease is controlled with the current treatment plan.
"
"Most cases of pannus are not preventable, because they are thought to be immune-mediated or inherited.
"
"However, dogs who spend time at high altitudes have a higher likelihood of developing this condition due to increased ultraviolet light exposure; therefore, protecting a dog’s eyes from UV exposure and keeping them indoors when the sun is at its peak can reduce the risk of disease.
"
"Pannus is a serious condition in dogs that requires treatment. If left untreated, the cornea can become scarred and ultimately lead to blindness.
"
"Pannus is a slowly progressive disease. It usually worsens over several months. However, exposure to ultraviolet light can quicken this process.

"Panosteitis in dogs, also known as pano, is a condition that affects the long bones of the legs. Because it most commonly affects large-breed dogs that are less than 2 years old, it has been called growing pains in dogs.
"
"Although it might not sound serious, it can be very painful and cause severe limping when a dog’s bones are touched. Unfortunately, it can occur in multiple legs and move to a different leg after the first leg gets better. 
"
"It’s a self-limiting disease, which means that it will resolve on its own over time, but you should also see your vet to prescribe pain medication until it does. Here’s what you need to know about panosteitis in dogs.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The predominant symptom of panosteitis is limping and leg pain. The pain can come on suddenly and then resolve very quickly. You usually won’t see any signs of injury or trauma—your dog just wakes up limping one day.
"
"It can also be hard to know when your dog is in pain. If you gently squeeze the long bones of their leg, sometimes your dog will cry out or pull the leg away in pain. It can be so painful that they will not want to use the affected leg.
"
"Panosteitis in dogs is similar to growing pains in people.
"
"Because large-breed dogs—especially German Shepherds—are prone to it, there is a genetic component to this disease, but there is no identifiable gene mutation that causes it. Typically, it occurs between 6 months and 2 years of age, but you can sometimes see it in German Shepherds over 2 years of age.

"The pancreas is an organ in the abdominal cavity.
"
"One of its roles is producing digestive enzymes, which help break down food products. When this normal process goes awry, the pancreas can become inflamed. This is a condition called pancreatitis.
"
"Pancreatitis in dogs is an inflammatory reaction within the pancreas that can result in abdominal pain, inappetence, and vomiting.
"
"Affected dogs may display a praying position. In this position, the dog will raise their hind end in the air and bow their head down towards their front legs.
"
"This position relives abdominal discomfort that’s associated with an inflamed pancreas. Dogs with pancreatitis often experience significant dehydration since they are vomiting.
"
"The inflammation results from the inappropriate, early activation of an enzyme within the pancreas, which causes the pancreas to digest itself.
"
"If left untreated, pancreatitis in dogs can become chronic and lead to weight loss and lethargy.
"
"Seek prompt veterinary care if you think your dog may have pancreatitis. Early intervention is critical in helping dogs feel better and in preventing worsening of symptoms.

"Leishmaniasis, the medical term used for the diseased condition that is brought about by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, can be categorized by two types of diseases in dogs: a cutaneous (skin) reaction and a visceral (abdominal organ) reaction -- also known as black fever, the most severe form of leishmaniasis.
"
"The infection is acquired when sandflies transmit the flagellated parasites into the skin of a host. The incubation period from infection to symptoms is generally between one month to several years. In dogs, it invariably spreads throughout the body to most organs; renal (kidney) failure is the most common cause of death, and virtually all infected dogs develop visceral or systemic disease. As much as 90 percent of infected dogs will also have skin involvement. There is no age, gender, or breed predilection; however, males are more likely to have a visceral reaction.
"
"The main organ systems affected are the skin, kidneys, spleen, liver, eyes, and joints. There is also commonly a skin reaction, with lesions on the skin, and hair loss. There is marked tendency to hemorrhage.
"
"Affected dogs in the U.S. are frequently found to have acquired the Leishmania infection in another country, notably the Mediterranean basin, Portugal, and Spain. There have also been sporadic cases confirmed in Switzerland, northern France, and the Netherlands, and endemic areas found in South and Central America, and in southern Mexico. Endemic cases in Oklahoma and Ohio have been reported in dog populations there as well.
"
"It is important to note that leishmaniasis is a zoonotic infection, and the organisms residing in the lesions can be communicated to humans.
"
"There are two types of leishmaniasis seen in dogs: visceral and cutaneous. Each type affect different parts of the dog's body.
"
"Visceral — affects organs of the abdominal cavity 
"
"Cutaneous — affects the skin 
"
"Other signs and symptoms associated with leishmaniasis include:
"
" 
"
"Traveling to endemic regions (usually the Mediterranean), where the dog can be exposed to sandflies -- a Leishmania host  -- is the most common way of contracting the infection. However, receiving a transfusion from another infected animal can also lead to leishmaniasis.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your doctor will be looking for evidence of such diseases as lupus, cancer, and distemper, among other possible causes for the symptoms. Tissue samples from the skin, spleen, bone marrow, or lymph nodes will be taken for laboratory culturing, as well as fluid aspirates. Since there are often related lesions on the skin's surface, a skin biopsy will be in order as well.
"
"Most dogs with leishmaniasis have high levels of protein and gammaglobulin, as well as high liver enzyme activity. Even so, your veterinarian will need to eliminate tick fever as the cause of the symptoms, and may test specifically for lupus in order to rule it out or confirm it as a cause.
"
"
"
"The disease affects the mid-shaft of the long bones and causes production of bone inside of the marrow cavity. Luckily, it does not affect the bone marrow’s ability to produce blood cells, and there is no lasting injury to the bone marrow.
"
"High-protein diets may predispose large-breed dogs to panosteitis, so it is important to feed your dog a high-quality, large-breed puppy food to help prevent it.
"
"To diagnose panosteitis, veterinarians start with your dog’s history and a physical exam. Your dog’s health information, such as being a young, large-breed dog with a sudden onset of limping, is often the biggest clue.
"
"For the physical exam, your veterinarian first watches your dog as they walk to identify which legs are affected. Then, the vet performs an orthopedic examination by firmly pressing on all parts of the legs, back, and neck to check for pain reactions. They will also flex and extend all of your dog’s joints.
"
"Dogs with panosteitis will feel pain when the vet presses on the long bones in their leg. Your dog may tense up or even cry out and look at the spot that is painful when the veterinarian squeezes the bone.
"
"X-rays can also help diagnose panosteitis in dogs. Ordinarily, the bone marrow is darker than the outside of the bone, called the cortex. In panosteitis, the cortex bone can be seen extending into the dark marrow cavity.
"
"However, signs of pain can occur up to 10 days before the x-rays show changes, so a normal x-ray does not necessarily mean your dog does not have panosteitis. But x-rays do help rule out other causes of bone pain in dogs, such as infections, tumors, and broken bones.
"
"Treating dogs for panosteitis primarily involves nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory medications to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Restricting your dog's activity also helps.
"
"An episode of panosteitis typically lasts a few weeks and then goes away. It sometimes happens again, in different legs, weeks to months later. Fortunately, after your dog is 2 years old, pano usually stops with no lasting inflammation or pain. 
"
"Reducing your puppy’s activity will help alleviate growing pains. Your veterinarian can also prescribe a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory pain medication, such as carprofen, to relieve pain. 
"
"Puppies or young adult dogs with growing pains often suddenly start limping with no known injury. Visit a vet for confirmation.  
"
"Typically, each growing pain episode lasts 2-4 weeks. Once your dog reaches age 2, growing pains usually cease.

"
"Pancreatitis can present as a sudden-onset (acute) illness or as a more long-term (chronic) illness. 
"
"A dog that has acute pancreatitis will have more serious clinical signs, such as:
"
"Severe lethargy
"
"Abdominal pain
"
"Persistent vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Severe dehydration
"
"Collapse and shock (sometimes)
"
"A dog with chronic pancreatitis is typically not as sick. The clinical signs may include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite to not eating at all
"
"Weight loss
"
"Abdominal pain and/or vomiting
"
"In general, chronic pancreatitis in dogs is not as common as acute pancreatitis.
"
"Dogs with chronic pancreatitis can suddenly develop worsening pancreatitis. This is a situation where chronic pancreatitis presents acutely. 
"
"Pancreatitis can worsen quickly if treatment is not started promptly after symptoms first begin.
"
"Dogs with worsening pancreatitis are often severely dehydrated, lethargic and weak, and in pain.
"
"Dogs who showed some interest in food may not eat at all if their condition is advancing. If a dog’s pancreatitis is worsening, hospitalization and supportive care is needed.
"
"Typically, a dog that’s diagnosed with pancreatitis likely ate a high-fat meal or got into the garbage. Unfortunately, this is not the most common cause of pancreatitis. Most cases of pancreatitis in dogs are idiopathic (can’t be determined).
"
"Some breeds are more prone to the development of pancreatitis, as well as dogs taking certain medications.
"
"Miniature Schnauzers are a predisposed breed due their tendency to have problems with high blood triglyceride levels. Another example is the English Cocker Spaniel.
"
"Unless your dog is extremely ill, it will be treated as an outpatient. If it is emaciated and chronically infected, you may need to consider euthanasia because the prognosis is very poor for such animals. If your dog is not severely infected, your veterinarian will prescribe a high-quality protein diet, one that is designed specifically for renal insufficiency if necessary.
"
"This is a zoonotic infection, and the organisms residing in the lesions can be communicated to humans. These organisms will never be entirely eliminated, and relapse, requiring treatment, is inevitable.
"
"There are medications that can be helpful in treating symptoms and in addressing the disease. Your veterinarian will advise you on the best course.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to monitor your dog for clinical improvement and for identification of organisms in repeat biopsies. You can expect a relapse a few months to a year after the initial therapy; your veterinarian will want to recheck your dog's condition at least every two months after completion of the initial treatment. The prognosis for a successful cure is very guarded.

"Immune-mediated diseases—which result from abnormal activity of the immune system—are seen at a higher frequency in this breed, and the immune system attacking the pancreas is no exception.
"
"Some chemotherapy medications and antibiotics can cause inflammation of the pancreas.
"
"Disease of the pancreas can be difficult to identify. The signs of illness are not specific to the pancreas, and routine blood tests are often not helpful.
"
"However, there are pancreatic-specific blood tests that can be performed when a veterinarian has a high suspicion of pancreatitis. Unfortunately, even these special tests are not 100% accurate.
"
"Abdominal X-rays are also not very helpful in diagnosing pancreatitis in dogs.
"
"However, in a vomiting patient, it’s important to take X-rays to rule out a potential foreign-body obstruction of the stomach and/or intestine (something your dog ate, like a squeaker out of a toy).
"
"The best method to image the pancreas is via abdominal ultrasound.
"
"However, the tissue of the pancreas must be abnormal enough to visualize using the ultrasound.
"
"This is more common in dogs with acute, severe pancreatitis, compared to those with chronic, mild pancreatitis.
"
"Overall, blood testing and abdominal ultrasounds are better in helping to diagnose pancreatitis in dogs when it’s a acute and severe case. 
"
"Treatment of pancreatitis in dogs is primarily supportive care regardless of whether the patient has acute or chronic pancreatitis. 
"
"Treatment for pancreatitis may include the following:
"
"Intravenous (IV) fluid and electrolyte support
"
"Pain medications
"
"Antinausea medication(s)
"
"Stomach-protectant medications
"
"Nutritional support in the form of a feeding tube
"
"Appetite stimulants
"
"Antibiotics (sometimes)
"
"Immunosuppressants (in chronic cases)
"
"A bland, low-fat diet is recommended during recovery (this may be a home-cooked and/or home-prepared diet)
"
"How long treatment lasts for depends on how severe the symptoms were when the dog arrived at the veterinary hospital and how long symptoms have been present.
"
"A dog with very mild pancreatitis may be treated on an outpatient basis, while dogs with severe pancreatitis require hospitalization.
"
"Likewise, the cost of treating pancreatitis varies based on severity. Pet parents can expect to pay anywhere from $500 to $5,000 for treatment.
"
"A permanent diet change may be recommended, especially in predisposed breeds or dogs with a history of pancreatitis.  
"
"The prognosis for dogs with pancreatitis ultimately depends on the severity of the illness.
"
"A dog with severe pancreatitis has a poor to grave overall prognosis, thus a higher risk of loss of life.
"
"Patients with mild pancreatitis generally recover within a week or two. To ensure your dog’s comfort during recovery, follow your veterinarian’s instructions closely for prescription medications and provide your dog a quiet space to rest in.
"
"Some dogs may experience multiple bouts of mild pancreatitis during their lives and benefit from a strict low-fat diet, such as Royal Canin® Gastrointestinal Low Fat dog food, and management of any concurrent health issues.
"
"Appetite stimulants, such as mirtazapine, may be helpful for dogs not interested in eating.
"
"A dog that has recovered from just a single episode of pancreatitis may develop extensive scarring within the pancreatic tissue.
"
"Scarring of the pancreas can lead to the development of diabetes mellitus and/or a condition called exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).
"
"Symptoms of pancreatitis in dogs are not specific to the pancreas—because of this, it can be a challenge to diagnose.
"
"However, the earlier the diagnosis and treatment, the better the chance for recovery.  
"
"Most cases of pancreatitis are due to unknown causes, so it’s difficult to prevent.
"
"However, because diet is linked to the development of pancreatitis, refraining from feeding your dog table scraps and high-fat foods reduces the risk of this condition.
"
"Dogs with underlying health conditions, such as Cushing’s disease, are at an increased risk of pancreatitis.
"
"Bringing your dog to follow-up appointments and giving medications as prescribed for chronic health conditions will reduce their risk for pancreatitis.

"The pancreas is located on the right side of a dog’s abdomen close to the end of the stomach and the beginning of the small intestine. The pancreas is responsible for producing hormones as well as digestive enzymes that help to break down food during the digestion process. 
"
"The second most common type of pancreatic cancer in dogs, after insulinomas, is pancreatic adenocarcinoma. An adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in the glands that produce digestive enzymes. Pancreatic cancer in dogs is typically an aggressive form of cancer that progresses rapidly and easily spreads to other organs, including:  
"
"Liver 
"
"Lymph Nodes  
"
"Spleen  
"
"Intra-Abdominal Fat 
"
"Bone 
"
"Kidneys   
"
"Brain 
"
"Symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma are generally vague and are most commonly associated with gastrointestinal upset and decreases in overall energy and appetite.  
"
"Tumors of the pancreas may grow large enough, or in the appropriate region, to obstruct the common bile duct of the liver. The common bile duct carries bile from the liver and gall bladder by way of the pancreas to the intestines. Interference of this anatomy can lead to a gall bladder obstruction and signs of liver disease. 
"
"Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will also cause symptoms that are associated with the body systems that it spreads to. 
"
"Other symptoms may include: 
"
"Gastrointestinal signs such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or development of an abdominal mass 
"
"Increased thirst and urination 
"
"Difficulty breathing 
"
"Jaundice (yellowing of the skin) 
"
"Bone pain 
"
"Hair loss 
"
"Changes in mentation 
"
"The general cause for this type of cancer is unknown. Labrador Retrievers, Airedale Terriers, Boxers, and Spaniel breeds typically have a genetic predisposition to pancreatic cancer. This disease is also found to occur more commonly in female dogs than male dogs.
"
"Veterinarians can use multiple diagnostic methods to diagnose pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  
"
"Blood work may show abnormalities in liver or kidney values, signs of anemia, dehydration, and elevated white blood cells. Imaging techniques including radiography, ultrasonography, or CT scanning can be used to visualize a pancreatic mass (tumor). 
"
"If a tumor is detected, it can be tested for cancer using cytology (analysis of cells collected with a needle) or histopathology (a tissue biopsy). 
"
"Surgery is typically not recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma because, by the time of diagnosis, there is a very high probability of metastasis. Chemotherapy has also been unsuccessful in treating pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
"
"The prognosis for pancreatic adenocarcinomas is typically poor. Supportive care is recommended until the dog’s quality of life is adversely impacted. At that point, humane euthanasia may be recommended. Your vet will be able to determine a medical management plan that works best for your dog depending on their diagnosis.
"
"The average survival time for dogs diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is typically days, because of progressing clinical decline, presence of metastasis, or the diagnosis itself.
"
"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a very aggressive cancer with a high metastatic rate, meaning it spreads easily from the pancreas rapidly through the rest of the body.
"
"Currently, pancreatic adenocarcinoma in dogs has a very low possibility of being cured surgically.

"Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a disorder of unknown cause, characterized by persistent eosinophilia -- sustained overproduction of eosinophils (white blood cells of the immune system) in the bone marrow. However, its suspected cause is a link to a severe reaction to an  unidentified antigen, or impairment of the immune response and control  of eosinophil production. This is a multi-system syndrome, with invasion of the tissues by  eosinophils and subsequent organ damage and dysfunction. It frequently  has a fatal outcome.
"
"Organ damage can result from the effects of eosinophil granule products and eosinophil-derived cytokines, a category of regulatory proteins that are released by cells in the immune system into the tissues. Common sites of infiltration include the gastrointestinal tract (especially the intestine and liver), spleen, bone marrow, lungs, and lymph nodes (especially those in the abdominal area).
"
"Less common sites of infiltration include the skin, kidney, heart, thyroid, adrenal glands and pancreas. This condition is rare in dogs, but Rottweilers may be predisposed.
"
"The cause of hypereosinophilic syndrome is unknown. However, it is believed to be cause by a severe reaction to an underlying, as yet unidentifiable antigenic stimulus that may be composed of two different strains of a virus.
"
"The veterinary examination will consist of standard laboratory work, including a complete blood profile, chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. Additional diagnostics will include a bone marrow aspiration and/or core biopsy of the cells, and a biopsy of the affected organ or mass. It is typical for the blood test results to show increased amounts of multiple types of white blood cells, most notably leukocytosis (leukocyte), basophilia (basophil), and eosinophilia (eosinophil). The results of the blood tests may also show anemic conditions, and the biochemical profile may show abnormalities in the case of organ dysfunction.
"
"Diagnostic imaging can be helpful in determining the extent of organ damage as well. Radiographic contrast, which uses an injection of a radiocontrasting agent into the area to be viewed, may be used to improve visibility of the internal organs. These X-rays may show thickened intestines and abnormalities in the lining of the intestines. Other findings may be reactive hyperplasia (abnormal enlargement) of the lymph nodes due to eosinophil infiltration, and fibrosis (excess fibrous connective tissue) and thrombosis (coagulation in the arteries) surrounding the heart.
"
"
"
"Long-term maintenance therapy will be employed to control or reduce the eosinophilia and organ damage. High serum immunoglobulin concentrations (the fraction of the blood serum that contains antibodies) can signify a good response to treatment with prednisone, a corticosteroid given to reduce inflammation, and therefore a better prognosis. Prednisone can be effective at suppressing eosinophil production. In some cases, chemotherapy may be appropriate for inhibiting DNA synthesis, in effect, reducing the reproduction of cells. Massive tissue infiltration can impede treatment and usually leads to a poor prognosis.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up examinations for your dog to monitor eosinophil count (not always indicative of tissue infiltrates) and myelosuppression (by which bone marrow activity is decreased) if chemotherapeutic drugs are being used. Clinical signs will also be monitored along with any physical abnormalities (e.g. loss of appetite, lethargy, vomiting, and diarrhea).

"Dysuria is a condition that leads to painful urination in the animal, while pollakiuria refers to abnormally frequent urination. While the urinary bladder and urethra normally serve to store and release the urine, these two disorders affect the lower urinary tract by damaging the bladder wall or stimulating the nerve endings in the bladder or urethra. In other words, you'll have a pet that goes to the bathroom often, and it may even have pain or discomfort when it urinates.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Dysuria and pollakiuria are generally caused by lesions, stones, cancer or trauma in the urinary bladder and/or urethra. (Lesions and stones are good indicators of a lower urinary tract disease.)
"
"Other factors include:
"
"For the Urinary Bladder
"
"For the Urethra
"
"For the Prostrate Gland
"
"  
"
"After establishing a thorough medical and behavioral history on the dog, the veterinarian will be able to rule out a variety of causes, such as surgical procedures, spraying or marking territory, and drug usage. Once those are ruled out, the veterinarian will run tests (i.e., blood, urine, etc.) to determine which of the causes listed above is affecting your pet.
"
"
"
"Estrogen -- a type of hormone -- is naturally produced in female dogs. It is responsible for normal sexual behavior and development, and the customary biological function of the female reproductive tract. Overproduction of estrogen can result in what is known as estrogen toxicity (hyperestrogenism). This can happen without any outside interference or it can occur when estrogens are being introduced artificially.
"
"Estrogens sometimes cause abnormal (cystic) cells to line the uterus and this permits the invasion of bacteria from the vagina. The cervix is open during ""heat,"" but if it is closed it can lead to a serious infection (pyometra). In addition, a concentration of estrogen can result in infertility, as well as an imbalance in the blood.
"
"  
"
"
"
"Recovery may take a while -- up to several months -- so be prepared to provide long-term care for your pet. Be vigilant in providing prescribed medications and aware of any changes in your pet. Blood tests (and sometimes bone-marrow biopsies) must be performed to evaluate your pet's response to the therapy.
"
"Do not give estrogen-containing compounds unless advised to by your veterinarian. Females will undergo tests to determine whether ovulation is occurring.
"
"In addition, a male dog should not show signs of feminization once a testicular tumor has been removed.

"There are three kinds dog ovarian tumors: epithelial tumors (skin/tissue), germ cell tumors (sperm and ova), and stromal tumors (connective tissue). The most common type of ovarian tumor in dogs is ovarian carcinomas. Granulosa cells are follicular cells (hollow cells) surrounded by theca cells (which form a surrounding sheath). Ovarian tumors are prone to metastasizing (spreading), and some are capable of producing hormones.
"
"The tumors described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"This condition is often associated with non-spayed and non-neutered dogs.

"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. You will need to give your doctor a thorough history of your dog's health, with a description of the onset of symptoms. X-rays may reveal the spread of cancerous cells (metastases) by way of the blood vessels or lymphatic system.
"
"Your veterinarian will also take X-rays and ultrasound images of the abdomen and chest to look for further evidence of tumors. Abdominal X-rays might show a unilateral or bilateral mid-abdominal mass near the kidney, or fluid build-up in the abdominal cavity. An ultrasound of the abdomen can reveal similar information, but with even greater sensitivity and detail. If there is excess fluid in the pleural (chest) lining, or fluid in the abdomen, your veterinarian will take a fluid sample for microscopic (cytologic) examination.
"
"If the size of the tumor is minor, and the growth minimal, your veterinarian may recommend surgery to remove a solitary tumor, or to take a tissue sample (biopsy) of the tumor. Even if a tumor appears to be obviously malignant, and is metastasizing (growing), a biopsy can still be invaluable for the final, definitive diagnosis.
"
"Your veterinarian may also want to perform a procedure called a histopathologic examination, for tracking changes in the tissue, to better understand the character of the growth.
"
"
"
"A single tumor can be removed surgically, and will generally not require a long stay in the veterinary hospital. Although benign tumors are rare, there are cases where this is so, and dogs that have this type of tumor will easily recover. This is also generally true in cases where a malignant tumor has been located and treated before it has the opportunity to spread.
"
"A malignant tumor that has spread can be treated with chemotherapy, and its growth may be halted, put into remission, and sometimes cured all together. The prognosis for this condition is guarded. Cancerous tumors are notoriously independent, and treatment is not always effective.
"
"Schedule follow-up appointments every three months so that your veterinarian can check for new or continued growth (mestasis).

"Urethral prolapse is a condition where the urethra's mucosal lining (the mucus-producing lining of the canal that carries urine out of the bladder) falls out of place, often moving to the outer portion of the urethra, vaginal, or penile opening, making it visible.
"
"Urethral prolapse can affect several other parts of a dog's body, including the urinary bladder (the storage sac for urine), the urinary tract, reproductive organs, and the immune system.
"
"In many instances, no specific treatment is required unless there is a more serious underlying medical condition, or in the event of an infection.
"
"Urethral prolapse can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"A prolapsed urethra often looks similar to a pea-sized mass, and may be red or purple in color. This can often be observed as a small mass of tissue on the end of the penis (or in a female, protruding from the urethral tract).
"
"If the dog excessively licks the mass, it can become enlarged or inflamed. In some cases, the protrusion can bleed on or around the urethral opening. Dogs with urethral prolapse usually have difficulties urinating.
"
"Sexual excitement may cause the mass to develop, as does inner abdominal pressure. Other possible causes include:
"
"And while it can occur in any breed, Boston Terriers and Bulldogs seem to be especially prone to this medical condition.
"
"X-rays and other types of diagnostic imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized axial tomography scans (CAT) are often used to rule out any underlying issues with the prostate or bladder. Upon examination, your veterinarian will also need to rule out other common underlying causes, including fractures of the penis and urethral and testicular diseases.
"
"Because some issues are only present during ejaculation, your veterinarian may find this action helpful for examining the body's genital functioning.
"
"
"
"If there is inflammation or risk for infection, antibiotics are often prescribed prophylactically (preventively). In cases of extensive bleeding or pain, surgery will generally be recommended, but in many instances there is no need for treatment. Slowing your dog's physical activity to allow time for rest and healing is generally all that is required for the condition to pass.
"
"The risk of recurrence is fairly high, so it is important for you to observe any physical changes to the dog's genital area.
"
"Unfortunately, there are no preventive measures for urethral prolapse. If a dog shows a high likelihood of recurrence, neutering the animal may be your best option.

"Osteomyelitis is inflammation of the bone and/or bone marrow due to a bacterial or fungal infection. It can occur when infection enters the bloodstream and spreads to surrounding structures, including the bone. Infection can also be directly introduced into the bone from a traumatic injury such as a fracture, or a deep, penetrating wound. Most often, osteomyelitis affects the limbs and the jaw.
"
"This is a serious condition that can destroy the bone, and prompt treatment is necessary. Unfortunately, osteomyelitis can be difficult to treat and often requires long-term management, depending on the severity and cause.
"
"This condition can occur suddenly (acute) or develop slowly over time (a chronic condition that may occur over months). Infection can be bacterial or fungal:

"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Causes of this condition include the following:
"
"Systemic infection: Infections occurring elsewhere in the body can migrate to the bone through the bloodstream. An example would be a hunting dog inhaling fungal spores found in the soil into its lungs.  Dogs with impaired immune systems are more at risk.
"
"Traumatic injury: Fractures that expose the bone can lead to contamination with bacteria or fungal organisms found normally on the skin, or in the surrounding environment.
"
"Bites or punctures: Wounds due to deep penetration by a foreign object, such as a gunshot injury.
"
"Post-surgical issues: Following orthopedic surgery for metal implants, osteomyelitis may occur if there are underlying complications. Types of implants include bone plates, screws, and rings.
"
"Dental disease: Oral tumors can invade the jaw and cause infection, as well as severe periodontal disease (dental decay).
"
"Viruses have not yet been found to be a cause of osteomyelitis in dogs.
"
"Infection and inflammation within the bone can produce signs specific to the infected area or throughout the body, including: 
"
"Lameness 
"
"Pain/discomfort 
"
"Swelling of the affected area 
"
"Visible wounds that may appear infected 
"
"Fever 
"
"Lack of energy  
"
"Depression and weakness 
"
"Decreased appetite  
"
"Symptoms can vary widely depending on the areas affected. For example, a dog with bone infection in the jaw may also experience pain while eating and have halitosis (foul-smelling breath). 
"
"At the initial appointment, your veterinarian will take a detailed medical history of your dog, ask questions regarding any recent travel, and a precise timeline of the onset of symptoms. 
"
"A thorough medical history will allow your veterinarian to determine if this is an acute or chronic infection, and whether it is more likely to be bacterial or fungal in origin. A thorough physical examination will be performed.  
"
"Your veterinarian will recommend diagnostic testing to determine the areas of bone involved and severity of the infection present. Tests will include a CBC (complete blood count), serum chemistry profile, and a urinalysis. The lab work results will likely show an elevation in white blood cells, among other changes associated with an active immune response.  
"
"Imaging studies such as X-rays will provide a more detailed picture of the underlying bony changes that may have occurred. Fungal and bacterial cultures can also be performed to identify the organism and guide treatment for your dog.  
"
"Specialized testing may be recommended in more severe cases of osteomyelitis, including ultrasound imaging and a surgical bone biopsy. Referral to a veterinary specialist may also be recommended for your pet to help manage more complicated infections. 
"
"Your veterinarian will determine the most appropriate treatment for your dog based on the medical history, initial physical exam, and subsequent tests.
"
"Hospitalization for treatment and supportive care may be recommended. Any wounds will be treated, and fractured limbs will be stabilized. To treat osteomyelitis, the veterinarian staff may do the following, depending on the type and severity:
"
"
"
"With appropriate therapies and support from your veterinarian, osteomyelitis can be successfully treated, and your dog can make a full recovery. However, the overall prognosis will depend on the cause, duration and severity of the infection, and the extensiveness of any wounds, trauma, or present injury.
"
"All discharge instructions and medication directions from your veterinarian will need to be strictly followed. It is important to complete the full course of any antibiotic or antifungal prescribed. Regular follow-up appointments are to be expected, and additional diagnostics such as lab work and imaging will likely be performed to assess if proper healing is taking place.
"
"To help promote a successful treatment outcome at home, your veterinarian may recommend lifestyle modifications, including prolonged cage rest and activity restrictions, basic wound care management, and nutritional and supplemental therapies
"
"The most important way to prevent this condition is to seek immediate attention. If there are any wounds, trauma, or injuries—or if any signs of systemic illness—such as fever, lethargy, weakness or decreased appetite, see a veterinarian immediately.  If your dog has undergone an orthopedic procedure involving metal implants, it is critical to keep your veterinarian notified of any changes in health status. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of osteomyelitis is critical to promote a successful outcome.

"Osteosarcoma is a malignant neoplasia, or cancer, that surface from bone cells. It is the most common malignant tumor of the skeletal system. Although any dog breed can develop osteosarcoma, large and giant breeds are more commonly afflicted. Large breeds typically develop tumors on the appendicular skeleton (legs), while smaller breeds tend to develop osteosarcoma on the axial skeleton (spine, pelvis, skull, or ribs). 
"
"Endochondral ossification is a normal bone growth process by which cartilage is replaced by bone in the early development of the fetus. Osteochondrosis is a pathological condition in which normal endochondral ossification, the metamorphoses of cartilage to bone, is disturbed. The disturbance is often due to a disruption in the blood supply to the bone. The result is retention of excessive cartilage at the site as the process of endochondral ossification is halted, but cartilage continues to grow. The end result is abnormally thick regions of cartilage that are less resistant to mechanical stress, as opposed to the stronger and denser bone.
"
"Large and giant breeds, including great Danes, Labrador retrievers, Newfoundlands, rottweilers, Bernese mountain dogs, English setters, and old English sheepdogs are predisposed to this condition.
"
"You will need to give a thorough medical history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and any information you have about your dog's parentage. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The results of these tests are often within normal ranges in affected animals, but they are necessary for preliminary assumptions of your dog's overall health condition.
"
"Your veterinarian will examine your dog thoroughly, paying special attention to the limbs that are troubling your dog. Radiography imaging is the best tool for diagnosis of this problem; your veterinarian will take several x-rays of the affected joints and bones to best discern any abnormalities. The radiographs may show details of lesions and abnormalities related to this disease. Computed tomography (CT-scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also valuable diagnostic tools for visualizing the extent of any internal lesions.
"
"Your veterinarian will also take samples of fluid from the affected joints (synovial fluid) to confirm involvement of the joint and to rule out an infectious disease that may be the actual cause of the lameness. More advanced diagnostic and therapeutic tools like arthroscopy may also be used. Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure which allows for examination and sometime treatment of damage inside the joint. This procedure is performed using an arthroscope, a type of endoscope inserted into the joint through a small incision.
"
"
"
"After establishing the diagnosis, your veterinarian will plan corrective surgery. Either arthroscopy or arthrotomy (surgical incision into the joint) techniques can be used to reach the area. Your veterinarian will presribe medicines to control pain and inflammation for a few days after surgery.
"
"There are also some medicines that are available, and that are known to limit the cartilage damage and degeneration. Your doctor will explain your options to you based on the final diagnosis.
"
"During recovery and healing, activity will need to be restricted and weight control measures undertaken to decrease stress on the affected joints. When taking your dog outdoors for walks, control the level of activity with a leash, making sure that your dog stays to a slow walk. Activity should be restricted for about 4-6 weeks, but early, active, therapeutic movement of the affected joints is encouraged for improved healing.
"
"You should not allow your dog to run freely on concrete or hard surfaces. A yearly examination is necessary for preventing progression of degenerative joint disease. Balanced nutrition is also an important aspect of promoting rapid growth and keeping the weight under control and within normal range for your dog's breed, age and size. Weight control will also help in decreasing the load and stress on the affected joints.
"
"Bone cells, such as osteoblasts and osteoclasts, are responsible for continuously remodeling bones. The body keeps these cells highly organized and controlled. When they go awry, they’re responsible for the destructive and highly aggressive nature of osteosarcoma in dogs. 
"
"First, osteosarcoma is locally invasive. The cancer starts in the middle of the bone, in the marrow, where the primitive bone precursor cells live. The tumor expresses many abnormalities at the molecular level that disrupt normal cell behavior, resulting in unregulated growth and behavior. Instead of maintaining a high degree of order during bone remodeling, the aberrant cells destroy some areas of the bone while producing abnormal amounts of bone in other areas.  
"
"Osteosarcoma is also aggressive distantly, with most cases already having spread to other sites outside the bone cavity, typically the lungs, at the time of diagnosis.  
"
"The development of osteosarcoma in dogs is complicated, but it is believed to have a genetic component. In some breeds, such as Rottweilers, the risk of osteosarcoma may decrease with early spay and neuter; the reason for this is unknown. 
"
"Osteosarcoma is most often diagnosed in dogs between the ages of 6 and 8 years old. However, veterinarians have diagnosed dogs as young as six months with osteosarcoma.

"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Because canine osteosarcoma most commonly affects the limbs, most dogs show signs of lameness. Other exam findings include:  
"
"Limb soft tissue swelling 
"
"Palpable mass 
"
"Limb asymmetry—one limb larger or abnormal looking in comparison 
"
"Decreased appetite 
"
"Painful, typically the limbs when touched or when walking 
"
"Tachycardia (elevated heart rate)  
"
"Dehydration  
"
"Neurologic signs
"
"Genetics play a large role in the development of osteosarcoma, especially in large and giant breeds. Researchers have identified some genetic risk factors in breeds like:  
"
"Scottish Deerhounds 
"
"Rottweilers 
"
"Greyhounds 
"
"Irish Wolfhounds 
"
"Even without a genetic predisposition, osteosarcoma can develop at previous trauma sites in bone, such as: 
"
"Radiation therapy sites 
"
"Previously healed fractures 
"
"Chronic osteomyelitis (bone infection) 
"
"Commonly, radiographs (X-rays) are the most useful diagnostic tool in osteosarcoma, although veterinarians may already suspect osteosarcoma based on age, breed, and clinical signs alone. Your vet will need at least two radiographic views of the affected limb and will look for classic signs of osteosarcoma including:  
"
"The overall prognosis largely depends on the location and extent of the problem. In some cases, recovery and life quality is excellent, while in other cases, the quality of life is restricted. Keep in mind that due to genetic element of this disease, you will need to have your dog neutered or spayed to prevent it from breeding, as the condition is very likely to be passed along.

"Lytic lesions: Areas that appear moth-eaten, where bone loss or destruction has occurred 
"
"Productive bone growth: Areas that have excessive and abnormal bone growth 
"
"“Sunburst” pattern: Area of combined abnormal bone changes that resemble a halo, crown, or sunburst  
"
"Soft tissue swelling around lesion 
"
"Pathologic fractures: Due to the highly unstable and decreased bone mass, many bones with osteosarcoma will break even without major trauma, especially with heavy dogs. 
"
"Location: Osteosarcoma typically forms in the long bones surrounding the knee in the hind legs and away from the elbow in the front legs, i.e., closer to the scapula or wrist. It does not cross joint spaces. 
"
"Although radiographs can be highly suggestive of osteosarcoma, they do not provide a definitive diagnosis. Other conditions can mimic canine osteosarcoma, such as:  
"
"Other primary bone tumors—fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma 
"
"Secondary bone tumors—metastasis from other sites 
"
"Infectious agents—fungal, bacterial, osteomyelitis 
"
"To obtain a definitive diagnosis, your vet will need additional diagnostic procedures. The following procedures may be recommended. 
"
"Cytology of the area is a relatively noninvasive procedure using a small needle to obtain a sample of cells from the lesion. Osteosarcoma cells have a common appearance under the microscope and can display signs of malignancy. Vets can even use special stains to test for markers sensitive and specific for osteosarcoma, which can aid in the diagnosis. The downside to cytology is that it typically samples the perimeter of the mass and may not get a diagnostic sample in the center.  
"
"Biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Your dog will need to be under full or moderate sedation, as this procedure is invasive and painful. A large sample will be obtained from the core of the lesion, and a veterinary pathologist will review the sample microscopically to confirm the diagnosis, identify the specific tumor type, and determine a prognosis.  
"
"Routine blood work is done to identify organ function and negative prognostic indicators, like an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that can be elevated with bone production. 
"
"Abdominal ultrasonography can be used to determine if the abnormal growth of cells has distant metastasis, or spread, in the abdominal cavity. 
"
"Three-view chest radiographs will indicate obvious, gross metastasis to the lungs. While most cancers have already spread microscopically to the lungs, less than 10% are detectable. Spread to the chest indicates a poor prognosis. 
"
"Echocardiography, or ultrasound of the heart, can help determine cardiac function in dogs with suspected heart disease, which may make them a poor candidate for treatment. 
"
"Advanced imaging, such as CT, MRI, and bone scans, can fully evaluate the extent of local and distant cancer spread.  
"
"Unfortunately, the long-term prognosis for osteosarcoma is poor. The two components to address with treatment are the locally painful bone lesion as well as the high likelihood of distant spread. Typically, after the diagnosis is made, veterinarians will “stage” dogs with osteosarcoma, which involves finding the presence of distant cancer spread, diagnosing concurrent diseases not related to the cancer, then determining a dog’s likely prognosis and eligibility for treatment. Treatment for osteosarcoma varies, and typically involves the following: 
"
"Surgical management: Removal of the primary bone tumor by amputating the entire limb is the most common consideration when dealing with appendicular osteosarcoma. It is a relatively common procedure in veterinary medicine and usually well tolerated by dogs, who compensate well on three legs. If the tumor originates from a site other than a limb, a dog may require such procedures as removal of a rib or mandible. If removal is not an option, veterinary surgeons utilize debulking procedures (removal of as much as possible of the tumor) or limb-sparing surgeries. 
"
"Chemotherapy: The use of systemic chemotherapeutic agents significantly prolongs the survival time after diagnosis. Currently, platinum-based chemotherapy agents (such as cisplatin or carboplatin) and doxorubicin are the standards of care for systemic chemotherapy in dogs with osteosarcoma.  
"
"Immunotherapy is a developing field involving using the body’s own immune system to help treat neoplastic cells. 
"
"Palliative options: If a dog is not a candidate for surgery or chemotherapy, other options exist to help ease pain and possibly increase survival time. These treatments include: 
"
"Traditional radiation therapy (relatively noninvasive) 
"
"Stereotactic radiation therapy (more invasive) and high-dose radiation therapy 
"
"Bisphosphate drugs, which inhibit bone destruction and decrease pain 
"
"Aggressive pain management, including drugs like NSAIDs, amantadine, gabapentin, and opioids 
"
"Management and prognosis of osteosarcoma depend on a dog’s specific treatment plan. Amputation alone only provides short-term pain relief. Most dogs succumb to distant metastasis within months, and only 10% of dogs will survive for one year. 
"
"The combination of amputation and chemotherapy increases the survival time to approximately one year after diagnosis, with 20% of dogs surviving longer than two years. Without any treatments, medical or surgical, the expected survival time is similar to amputation only, around 4 months. However, without amputation, dogs suffer from severe pain and the likelihood of pathologic fractures.  
"
"Veterinarians treating dogs with osteosarcoma require physical exams, blood work, and chest radiographs approximately every 2-3 months after treatment to monitor for metastasis and complications from surgery and chemotherapy, which can include infection, immune suppression, gastrointestinal issues, and bloodwork abnormalities. Some chemotherapeutic agents are toxic to the kidneys and heart, so veterinarians will also monitor for organ damage.
"
"There is no way currently to prevent bone cancer in dogs.
"
"Once a dog is diagnosed, the survival time is from 4 months to 1-2 years, depending on treatments.
"
"Bone cancer is extremely painful and requires multiple pain relievers.
"
"Often, limping and swelling are the first signs of osteosarcoma in a large breed dog.
"
"Osteosarcoma eventually spreads systemically, usually to the lungs. The bone will eventually weaken and break under normal stresses, like walking or standing, which is why veterinarians strongly recommend amputation when possible.

"
"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the synovial joints (common joints including hips and knees) and is the most frequent type of arthritis affecting dogs. This chronic disease occurs in roughly 25% of dogs and is irreversible.  
"
"Dogs with osteoarthritis experience a progressive loss of the articular cartilage surfaces of their joints. They also can develop small bony pieces within the joint as well as fibrosis (connective tissue) around the cartilage of the joint, leading to pain and impairment of limb function. 
 
Most cases of osteoarthritis in dogs occur as secondary conditions to diseases such as hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia. Other contributing factors to OA include bodyweight, obesity, gender, exercise, and diet. 
"
"A pet parent will usually notice signs of osteoarthritis in dogs. Most commonly, dogs will show: 
"
"Optic neuritis refers to a condition in which one or both of the optic nerves are swollen, resulting in impaired visual function. The optic nerve, sometimes called the cranial nerve, is a nerve in the eye that takes visual information and transmits it to the brain. Optic neuritis affects the ophthalmic and nervous systems of the body.
"
"The primary form of optic neuritis is uncommon and usually affects only dogs younger than three years of age. The secondary form of optic neuritis, however, in which the disease is secondary to another disease, such as central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, is more common.
"
"Optic neuritis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Optic neuritis may be a primary disease or a secondary disease, meaning it occurs due to the presence of another disease in the body, such as a central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Optic neuritis is secondary to systematic CNS disease because the optic nerve communicates with the outermost layers of the brain (subarachnoid space).
"
"Symptoms of optic neuritis include acute (sudden) onset of blindness and partial deficiencies in vision. A physical examination can reveal blindness or reduced vision in one or both eyes, fixed and dilated pupils, and a diminished light reflex of pupils. An examination of the anterior surface of the eye cavity may reveal a swollen optic disk, or a focal hemorrhage.
"
"As previously mentioned, primary optic neuritis is very rare, while secondary optic neuritis is more common. Causes of secondary optic neuritis vary greatly. Possible causes include neoplasm, which is an abnormal cell growth, such as a tumor; systemic mycoses (a fungal infection); a parasitic disease known as toxoplasmosis; or lead poisoning.
"
"In some cases, the disease is considered idiopathic, meaning that it seems to arise spontaneously from an obscure cause and no specific origin can be identified.
"
"The diagnostic procedure in cases of suspected optic neuritis generally includes an analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (the clear protective fluid in the cranium, in which the brain floats), and an electroretinogram in order to investigate the functioning capacity of the eye’s retina.
"
"Additional diagnostic procedures may include a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, urine analysis, and full chemical blood profile for the presence of fungi, viruses, or protozoa that may be causing an infection. will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition in order to further aid your veterinarian in making a diagnosis.
"
"
"
"Treatment for optic neuritis is directly dependent upon the underlying disease that led to the condition. Certain procedures and medications may be given if the primary disease is identifiable. If no specific cause can be identified, certain medications may still be prescribed by your veterinarian to help alleviate symptoms.
"
"The final prognosis for dogs with optic neuritis is ultimately dependent upon the underlying cause of the disease.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up visit to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment. If no primary cause can be identified and your pet is suffering from idiopathic optic neuritis, blindness or loss of vision may become permanent. Medication should be given as prescribed in order to prevent subsequent flare-ups.
"
"Decreased willingness to play or exercise, as well as decreased energy in overall activity. 
"
"Stiffness or lameness, such as a difficulty moving from sitting to standing. 
"
"A change in their posture and gait. 
"
"Dogs may try to protect themselves from pain by developing a bunny hop walk, sit in a way to leave the painful area extended, or overall appear weak or slouching when walking.
"
"Osteoarthritis is classified as primary or secondary. Primary osteoarthritis tends to be idiopathic (unknown cause) or associated with aging. Secondary osteoarthritis refers to the condition occurring because of another condition, such as: 
"
"Injury 
"
"Hip or elbow dysplasia 
"
"Cruciate tear 
"
"Patellar luxation 
"
"Age and weight play a factor in the development of osteoarthritis in dogs. Both primary and secondary osteoarthritis progress through a series of changes degrading the health of the joint, articular cartilage, joint capsule, synovial membrane, subchondral bone, and ligaments.
"
"Osteoarthritis in dogs is diagnosed through physical exam and imaging tools. Typically, veterinarians start by observing the dog’s gait patterns. Gait patterns include repetitive limb motions such as walking, trotting, or running. During a physical exam, a vet will feel for swelling or effusion (excess fluid in the joint) and note any decreased range of motion of joints. 
"
"Your vet will check for thickening around the joint, crepitus (rubbing and friction of bone and cartilage), or muscle atrophy (differences) in muscle size between similar joints. The exam may be done with your dog sedated to prevent pain.  
"
"
In addition to a physical exam, your vet may recommend: 
"
"Radiographs (X ray) 
"
"Bloodwork, if medication is to be prescribed 
"
"Joint fluid analysis, to rule out infection or, in some cases, cancer 
"
"Imaging tests, such as CT or MRI 
"
"Force plate gait analysis, which measures the force exerted between a paw and the ground when walking or standing still 
"
"Endoscopy of the affected joints, using a specialized thin tubing with a tiny camera and instruments that can visualize and sometimes treat problem areas 
"
"Your veterinarian has many ways to slow the progression of OA and will often use multiple approaches to find what works best for your dog.  
 
Over-the-counter medications and supplements may be prescribed, but it is important to follow your vet’s guidance carefully, as some medications may be fatal, and others have a low safety margin.  
"
"Commonly prescribed therapies include: 
"
"Supplements: Such as omega 3 fatty acids, glucosamine/chondroitin, and other natural anti-inflammatory products.  
	 
"
"NSAIDs to decrease inflammation and pain: Common drugs include carprofen, deracoxib, firocoxib, grapiprant, meloxicam, and others. These drugs can have side effects and not all dogs can tolerate them. Your veterinarian will recommend the best choice for your dog. 
	 
"
"Steroids: Such as prednisone, methylprednisolone, and triamcinolone. Steroid medications can have many side effects and must be handled carefully. 
	 
"
"Other pain medications that work with NSAIDs or through a different approach: These include gabapentin (anti-convulsant drug with analgesic properties), tramadol (synthetic opiate like agonist), and amantadine (NMDA receptor antagonist that may reverse central pain sensitization).

"Alternative therapies may be helpful for dogs with osteoarthritis. These include acupuncture, laser therapy, and physical rehabilitation including hands on techniques and therapeutic exercise. Chiropractic manipulation and stem cell therapy have also been helpful for some dogs. There has been some promising research and individual success stories regarding these therapies.   
"
"In some cases, surgery may be suggested to limit pain associated with the inflammation.  
"
"Your veterinarian may suggest lifestyle changes for a dog with OA. Weight loss and management is essential to reduce inflammation and stress on the joints. A vet may suggest a prescription diet along with regular exercise, when the dog is able to tolerate movement.   
"
"If your vet recommends surgical intervention, a rehabilitation and physical plan will be prescribed. This often includes rehabilitation, physical therapy, massages, swimming and the underwater treadmill.
"
"Many dogs with osteoarthritis will benefit from weight loss/maintenance, high quality dog food ingredients, supplements, regular physical therapy, and massages at home. There is no one remedy that works best for every dog so be sure to work with your veterinarian to come up with a plan that fits your individual pet.
"
"Simple things around the home can help make it easier for your dog with osteoarthritis to manage. These include using carpet runners or dog boots for slick areas, limiting access to stairs and swimming pools, and considering ramps or small stairs rather than jumping to beds/couches.
"
"Dogs with osteoarthritis likely have a shortened life span compared to a dog without osteoarthritis. However, with intervention, many dogs that have osteoarthritis can live long, comfortable lives.
"
"Discuss your specific situation with your veterinarian. Many dogs can benefit from low impact, regular exercise like walking. However, some dogs may need to control pain and inflammation prior to starting exercise or have specific circumstances that make walking a risk for falling.
"
"Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease of the synovial joints that includes inflammatory changes. Rheumatoid arthritis also includes inflammatory changes but is a disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s joints.
"
"Obesity is a risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis because of natural inflammatory effects and excessive strain on joints. Talk with your veterinarian about weight loss in a structured, positive way that sets your dog up for success.

"
"Oral masses are visible swellings within your dog’s mouth. It’s important to note that not all cases of oral masses are cancerous; in fact, the majority are benign.
"
"As a pet parent, it is important to regularly inspect your dog’s mouth, as early treatment can give your dog a happier, longer, and fuller life. Semi-annual checkups are key to early diagnosis and treatment.
"
"Benign tumors in dogs include the following:
"
"Peripheral odontogenic fibromas (POFs) are the most common oral masses in dogs. These tumors usually occur singularly, are not aggressive, and grow slowly. But they can become quite large.
"
"Acanthomatous ameloblastomas are benign since they don’t metastasize, but they are highly aggressive locally and can invade the bone and displace local structures, like the teeth.
"
"Odontomas are not as common as the others and usually arise from the same cells that form teeth. These tumors are slow to grow and are seen more often in younger dogs.
"
"Types of malignant tumors include:
"
"Melanoma is often pigmented and highly aggressive and has a high rate of metastasis, having already spread to the lungs and lymph nodes by the time of diagnosis. 
"
"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) often appears red in color because of its inflammatory and ulcerative nature. It most often invades the underlying bone.
"
"Fibrosarcoma is similar to SCC. These tumors are often locally aggressive but slow to metastasize.
"
"Osteosarcoma is a bone cancer that is more common in the long bones than in the jaw. It acts aggressively and can metastasize to the lungs and other areas.
"
"Other oral masses found inside your dog’s mouth may be related to poor dental hygiene. Periodontal disease causes inflammation and pain, often leading to gingival hyperplasia (excessive growth of the gums), which can often be mistaken for a mass. Dentigerous cysts can develop due to unerupted baby teeth, or oral papillomatosis, a virus transmitted from one (usually young) dog to another, which causes wartlike growths to form in the mouth.
"
"Not all oral masses are cancerous. Fortunately, in dogs, most of the time, the mass is found to be benign. However, just because it doesn’t metastasize (spread) elsewhere in the body doesn’t mean it won’t cause your dog significant discomfort, or pain.
"
"You may notice a mass inside your dog’s mouth that may be adjacent to a tooth, attached to the gum, inside of the lip, in the back of the throat, or even underneath the tongue. At times, the mass may become ulcerated (skin becomes inflamed and raw) or infected.
"
"Other signs include:
"
"Foul breath
"
"Bleeding from the mouth or bloody saliva
"
"Drooling
"
"Swollen face or facial asymmetry
"
"Pawing or rubbing at the face or mouth
"
"Jaw chattering
"
"Resistance to opening or closing the jaw, or brushing the teeth
"
"Difficulty eating, dropping food, and weight loss may be seen in advanced stages of the condition, when the tumor has grown excessively or become ulcerated or infected.
"
"Most oral masses in dogs occur for reasons that are not well understood. Multiple factors have been associated with certain tumors, including:
"
"Age
"
"UV damage (or other environmental triggers)
"
"DNA mutations
"
"Genetics
"
"Certain dog breeds are predisposed, including:
"
"Retriever
"
"Dachshund
"
"Boxer
"
"German Shepherd
"
"Scottish Terrier
"
"Poodle
"
"Other masses, such as papillomas, have been shown to be caused by the canine papillomavirus.
"
" 
"
"Visualization of the mass is the first step in diagnosis. From there, your veterinarian will often recommend a biopsy, where a core of tissue is obtained (sometimes, the entirety of the mass may be removed) and then submitted for histopathology, which will determine the type of growth along with the predictability of its behavior (i.e., rate of reoccurrence and metastatic potential).
"
"Usually, because the biopsy is performed under anesthesia, a set of dental radiographs will be recommended and performed as well. Dental radiographs are helpful for determining the extent and bony involvement of the tumor, as malignant masses will often invade the underlying bone and/or displace surrounding tissues, like the teeth. Dental radiographs are also needed to determine the presence of cysts, which often displace other structures but do not invade the bone. 
"
"Other tests that may be helpful for staging and treatment purposes include:
"
"Blood work
"
"Chest radiographs
"
"Abdominal ultrasound
"
"Aspirates/biopsies of the local lymph nodes
"
"CT/MRI
"
"Treatment is dependent on the tumor type, but for most oral masses in dogs, even those suffering from gingival hyperplasia, surgery is required. It is important that the mass itself is removed, along with enough surrounding tissue to prevent local reoccurrence of the mass. Sometimes this may include removing the tooth (or teeth) or even part of the jaw, often in cases of malignancy. 
"
"Radiation therapy or chemotherapy can follow if margins are narrow or in cases where surgery might be risky, such as in dogs with comorbidities that would exclude them from undergoing surgery or those in which metastasis is significant. For some tumors, like melanoma, a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy might be needed for treatment. 
"
"Cases of oral papillomatosis often don’t require therapy at all, as many cases will spontaneously resolve in a few months. Surgical removal, laser ablation therapy, or certain medications can cause regression as well.
"
"Surgical removal of the mass in most cases will provide a good outcome—and for many, a cure. Dogs affected with malignant tumors can have a good prognosis even if the mass isn’t completely removed, as sometimes, just removal of the mass can provide comfort and minimize pain and infection. However, local recurrence of the mass will most likely occur, so continued vigilance for signs of regrowth is critical moving forward.
"
"Your dog will often be discharged with pain medication, suggestions for a soft food diet, and instructions to not chew on toys while healing.
"
"Unfortunately, melanoma carries the worst prognosis overall, as these are highly malignant and have usually already spread by the time of diagnosis. Most dogs will succumb to the disease within a year.
"
"Although oral masses are not entirely preventable, if your dog receives routine medical care and biannual exams, you can increase the odds that masses are caught early and treated appropriately. As a pet parent, you can do your due diligence by providing your dog with daily at-home dental care via regular brushing, dental chews, wipes, or sprays and gels. This is the most opportune time to inspect your dog’s mouth and look for any signs of inflammation or tumor formation.

"Obesity can be defined as an excess accumulation of body fat that contributes to disease. Dogs that weigh at least 10% above their ideal body weight are considered overweight, while dogs weighing 20% more than ideal are considered obese. Excess body weight can be a contributing factor in many diseases.
"
"Up to 65% of dogs in the United States are considered overweight or obese. Obesity can contribute to many conditions in dogs, including:
"
"Arthritis
"
"Pancreatitis
"
"Kidney disease
"
"Respiratory compromise
"
"Decreased exercise and heat tolerance
"
"Increased risk of cardiovascular disease
"
"Abnormal response to insulin
"
"Increased anesthetic risk
"
"Decreased quality of life
"
"Showing love by showering your dog with treats may actually result in a shortened lifespan and decreased quality of life if the excess calories result in obesity.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Signs of obesity include:
"
"Weight gain
"
"Less energy than usual
"
"Decreased exercise tolerance
"
"A collar or harness that seems tighter than it used to be
"
"Being unable to feel the ribs, or seeing a “waistline” (a small tuck in the belly right in front of the hind legs)
"
"The most obvious cause of obesity in dogs is overfeeding, which can include the dog’s regular wet or dry food, treats designed for dogs, and “table scraps” or human foods. Inadequate exercise can also lead to your dog becoming overweight. There are some medical conditions that cause obesity, including hypothyroidism and hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing’s disease.
"
"In addition, certain dog breeds can be predisposed to obesity, including:
"
"Golden Retriever
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"Cocker Spaniel
"
"Dachshund
"
"Beagle
"
"Boxer
"
"Pug
"
"If you suspect your dog may be overweight, schedule a weight check and examination with your veterinarian. If there seems to be excess padding over your dog’s ribs or you are unable to see a slight tuck-up just in front of the hind legs, chances are good that your dog is carrying excess weight.
"
"Your veterinarian can obtain your dog’s weight and look for trends over time indicating weight gain or loss. A measurement called body condition scoring can also be done.
"
"The two most commonly used body condition scores are a five-point scale (where three is considered ideal) and a nine-point scale (where four to five is considered ideal). Your dog should have an hourglass shape when viewed from above if he is at his ideal body weight.
"
"Your veterinarian may also run some lab work to check for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to weight gain, such as hypothyroidism or Cushing’s disease. If the weight gain has been very sudden, your veterinarian may also recommend x-rays to check for fluid or masses in the abdomen.
"
"The basic components for treating obesity are exercise and dietary changes. Depending on the severity of obesity and current fitness level, increasing the amount of your dog’s daily exercise may need to be done gradually. In general, most dogs can safely exercise for 15-30 minutes per day to start. The duration and intensity can be slowly increased as your dog loses weight and becomes more fit. A simple walk is feasible for most families, but exercise can also include playing fetch indoors or outdoors, swimming, and running. If your dog is older, you may need to do shorter exercise sessions.
"
"Dietary changes should be made with the guidance of your dog’s veterinary team. The reduction or elimination of extras like treats and table scraps will be helpful, and a change in type and/or amount of food is often needed. There are many weight loss diets available, and some require a prescription from your veterinarian.
"
"A good goal is weight loss of 1-2% of body weight per week, ideally reducing body fat stores while maintaining lean body tissue. While most dog foods give feeding amount recommendations, these are only guidelines, and individual dogs may need more or less than recommended to maintain ideal body condition. Meal feeding (instead of free choice) is often helpful in controlling caloric intake. It is also important to use a measuring cup to ensure consistent feeding of the appropriate amount of food.
"
"Instead of eliminating treats completely, you may opt to switch to baby carrots, frozen green beans, pumpkin, or lower-calorie dog treats if your veterinarian agrees that these are good options for your dog.
"
"Medications are not typically needed to treat obesity unless your dog has hypothyroidism or Cushing’s disease, in which case regular exams and lab tests will help determine the appropriate type and dose of medication.
"
"Once your dog has reached his ideal weight, your veterinarian may recommend transitioning to a maintenance diet. It is important to continue regular exercise and limit extra treats and snacks.
"
"Of course, preventing obesity before it even happens would be ideal. This can be achieved by two or three meals per day instead of always having food available, avoiding excessive treats, and ensuring that your dog gets regular exercise. Exercise is not just good for your dog—it’s good for humans and offers physical and emotional benefits for all involved.
"
"While it takes effort to prevent or correct obesity, the benefits of a longer and healthier life are well worth it for you and your dog

"Nystagmus in dogs occurs when there is eyeball movement in a back-and-forth or circular motion that is out of the dog’s control.
"
"Dogs (and humans) normally have nystagmus as they turn their head. This is called physiologic nystagmus, which helps hold the image the dog sees in place as they turn their head. The eyes are working in tandem with the dog’s vestibular system, which provides the dog with a sense of balance, knowledge of body position, and information about direction of motion.
"
"If the dog’s head isn’t moving but they have nystagmus, the dog has a dysfunctional vestibular system causing abnormal (pathologic) nystagmus. Pathologic nystagmus can also occur with changes in position, such as when the dog is looking upward or lying on its side.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Jerk nystagmus, which is when the eye moves slowly in one direction and quickly back in the opposite direction, is the most common form in dogs.
"
"With pendular nystagmus, the eye movement occurs at the same speed in both directions. Pendular nystagmus is usually due to a congenital (at birth) condition.
"
"When the eyes move side-to-side, it’s called horizontal nystagmus.
"
"Abnormal eye movement in an up-and-down direction is vertical nystagmus in dogs.
"
"Involuntary movement in a circular motion is rotary nystagmus.
"
"Rarely, the eyes may each have a different direction of oscillation, such as the left eye moving horizontally while the right eye moves vertically. This is called disconjugate nystagmus.
"
"Nystagmus often occurs along with changes to the pet’s balance or other neurologic signs.
"
"Symptoms include:
"
"Uncontrolled and repetitive eye movements
"
"Head tilt
"
"Walking in circles
"
"Falling over or rolling
"
"Drunken gait (ataxia)
"
"Pupils not facing the same direction (strabismus) or uneven pupil size
"
"Lack of coordination or awareness of limb placement
"
"Loss of mental awareness
"
"Pathologic nystagmus is often seen when there has been damage to the middle/inner ear or to the brain, both important components of the vestibular system.
"
"Causes include:
"
"Inner or middle ear infection
"
"Middle ear surgeries or ear cleaning
"
"Congenital or hereditary abnormalities
"
"Tumors of the middle or inner ear or brain tumors
"
"Head trauma
"
"Strokes
"
"Inflammatory brain conditions, like granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME)
"
"Infections affecting the brain such as distemper virus or neosporosis
"
"Medications and toxins like metronidazole, anesthetics, or marijuana
"
"Hypothyroidism (rare)
"
"A common disorder in senior dogs with nystagmus is idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease. In this condition, nystagmus, head tilt, and disorientation occur without a known cause.
"
"Dog breeds that can have a higher risk of congenital nystagmus include:
"
"Doberman Pinschers
"
"Cocker Spaniels
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Other causes of nystagmus can occur in any breed.
"
"Abnormal nystagmus warrants calling your veterinarian. If your dog is so disoriented that you’re worried they may injure themselves, consider visiting an urgent care veterinarian.
"
"Your veterinarian can diagnose nystagmus through physical examination. What they won’t be able to do through examination alone is determine the exact cause.
"
"Diagnostics should include a neurologic examination, which involves testing reflexes, watching your pet walk, and other ways to determine which part of their vestibular system is affected. They will also want to perform an ear examination. A torn or swollen eardrum may indicate a middle or inner ear infection.
"
"In some cases, your veterinarian may recommend puncturing the eardrum (myringotomy) to get a sample for culture from the middle ear. Your pet will need to be anesthetized for this.
"
"If your veterinarian suspects a middle or inner ear condition, they may recommend you pursue a CT scan. Usually, CT scans are performed at specialty clinics and veterinary hospitals using sedation or general anesthesia.
"
"If they’re concerned that the brain may be affected, the veterinarian is more likely to recommend an MRI and analysis of the fluid that surrounds the brain (cerebrospinal fluid analysis). MRIs and cerebrospinal fluid collection are also generally performed at specialty clinics and veterinary hospitals using general anesthesia.
"
"Make sure to let your veterinarian know:
"
"If you’ve recently cleaned the dog’s ears or used medications for the ears
"
"Any new medications your pet is taking
"
"If your pet may have consumed marijuana
"
"Nystagmus itself can’t be cured, as it is generally a symptom of an underlying condition. If an underlying cause is determined, such as an inner ear infection, treatment is aimed toward resolving the underlying condition, which should resolve the nystagmus.
"
"Often, nystagmus occurs without a known cause as part of idiopathic vestibular disease. Treatment is more supportive, focused on altering the environment to prevent self-injury and providing anti-nausea medications like maropitant citrate.
"
"Dogs with brain disorders usually don’t do as well as ones who have idiopathic vestibular disease or a condition affecting their ears. Treatments vary widely depending on the type of condition, such as a brain tumor or an infection.
"
"With nystagmus occurring as part of idiopathic vestibular disease, improvement usually happens within one or two weeks.
"
"Nystagmus may resolve on its own within several weeks. However, if the underlying cause is not resolved, the symptoms may continue.
"
"With nystagmus your pet’s balance is altered, so make sure you’re keeping them safe from accidentally injuring themselves. This means keeping them away from stairs, off porches, and away from other fall risks. Consider keeping them confined in a well-padded area. Placing them in a dark room, though it may sound beneficial, can worsen their balance as it impairs their sense of orientation.
"
"Conditions causing nystagmus can recur. One episode of nystagmus does not make your dog immune to additional episodes.
"
"Most cases of nystagmus in dogs aren’t preventable. However, you should use caution when cleaning ears, as vigorous ear cleaning can lead to vestibular dysfunction and nystagmus.
"
"Speak with your veterinarian before placing any medications in the ears, even if it’s a medication you have used before.
"
"Ear infections can spread to the middle or inner ear.  It’s important to get your dog’s ear infections taken care of in a timely manner.
"
"Nystagmus in dogs isn’t painful, but disorientation can be distressing for them. Falls may result in injury, and some underlying causes like ear infections cause pain.
"
"Abnormal dog nystagmus is triggered by dysfunction in the vestibular system. Often this occurs without a known cause, but conditions affecting the middle ear, inner ear, or brain can lead to nystagmus.
"
"Most dogs with nystagmus still have vision, but it’s possible it may affect depth perception and visual clarity. With congenital nystagmus or conditions affecting the dog, some with nystagmus may be blind, though this is not caused by the nystagmus itself.

"The epithelium is the cellular covering of all of the internal and external surfaces of the body, protecting the organs, inner cavities and outer surfaces of the body in a continuous layer of multi-layered tissue. The squamous epithelium is a type of epithelium that consists of the outer layer of flat, scale-like cells, which are called squamous cells.
"
"In this case, squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal planum arises from the tissue in the nose pad, or in the mucous membranes of the nose. A squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the squamous epithelial cells, but in the case, the risk of  malignant metastasis is relatively low. It is often more invasive that metastatic. Exposure to inhaled chemicals increases the risk of nasal tumors, including indoor use of coal, cigarettes, and air fresheners.
"
"This tumor is rare in dogs as compared to cats. There does not appear to be any particular breed, gender or age that is more susceptible, but it is suspected that dogs with larger nasal passages may be at higher risk, and dogs with light pigmented noses are at risk. A lot of time spent in the sun can also increase the risk.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough medical history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a physical examination with full laboratory testing, including complete blood tests, biochemical profiles, and urinalysis. The results of these tests are usually normal in affected patients. While metastasis is rarely seen in the lungs, your veterinarian may take thoracic x-rays to evaluate for metastasis into the lungs. Other conditions your doctor will look for are dental diseases, aspergillosis, bacterial rhinitis, foreign object (such as a plant awn), and parasites (such as mites).
"
"For an appropriate diagnosis to be made, your veterinarian will need to take tissue and fluid samples from the affected area. Your veterinarian will also take samples from the lymph nodes to detect whether metastasis is occurring. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans may provide more information about the extent of the tumor, as well as to help in surgical resection of the tumor.
"
"
"
"There are various surgical modalities available and selection will be based on the location and extent of the problem. Surgery will be conducted to remove the affected tissue along with some margins of the normal tissue, to be certain that all of the affected tissue has been removed. If the tumor is invasive in nature, a deeper surgical resection will be required, followed by radiation therapy. Chemotherapy may also be advised in these patients, though it has not yet been satisfactorily evaluated for this type of cancer. Your veterinarian will consult a veterinary oncologist for the best treatment plan for your dog.
"
"Overall prognosis is good if the tumor is small and superficial. If the tumor is invasive and metastatic in nature, the prognosis will not be positive. The decision to go forward with surgery or chemical therapy will be based on the actual prognosis. In some cases, end of life pain management may be in order. Good nutritional support is essential for these patients to ensure maintenance of body weight and condition.
"
"Always seek advice and instructions from a veterinary oncologist before giving chemotherapy medications, as these drugs are highly toxic to human health. Pregnant women in particular should take extra care while administering chemotherapeutic drugs to their pets. Chemotherapy medications have the possibility of toxic side effects, so your veterinarian will need to closely monitor your dog's stability, changing dosage amounts as necessary.
"
"After surgery, you should expect your dog to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your dog to help minimize discomfort, and you will need to set up a place in the house where your dog can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Trips outdoors for bladder and bowel relief should be kept short and easy for your dog to handle during the recovery period. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication.
"
"If your dog is at increased risk for acquiring this disease, you may take preventive measures by limiting sun exposure, especially from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm. Sunscreens have not been found to be effective for the prevention of this tumor.

"Nasal adenocarcinoma is the most common type of nasal tumor (cancer) found in dogs. This type of tumor can occur anywhere in a dog’s nasal passage, including the sinus area. Nasal adenocarcinoma is typically aggressive in the nasal area, but it rarely metastasizes (spreads) to other areas of the body. If the cancer does spread, it usually spreads to nearby lymph nodes, lungs, and the brain. 
"
"Dogs tend to develop these tumors at twice the rate of cats, and studies have shown that these tumors are usually diagnosed around 10 years of age.  
"
"Most dogs with nasal adenocarcinomas will experience a runny nose prior to a diagnosis. Because this is a common symptom of many conditions, the nasal discharge may improve with treatment, which can delay a proper diagnosis. 
"
"The discharge may become bloody, clear, or appear like mucus. It often comes out from one side of the nose. As the tumor grows, the discharge may begin to emerge bilaterally, and may be associated with sneezing or snoring sounds. 
"
"If the tumor grows large enough, it can cause deformities of the face and destroy the surrounding soft and bony tissue. This may cause the eyes to protrude. In rare cases when the tumor spreads to the brain, the pet parent may see changes in behavior as well as sudden blindness or seizures. 
"
"Common symptoms of nasal adenocarcinoma include: 
"
"Chronic nasal discharge or bleeding 
"
"Swelling of the muzzle/face 
"
"A bleeding nose can come from several sources. One may be the result of a condition called coagulopathy — a condition where the blood is not coagulating as it should. There are several other possible causes for nose bleeds, such as a wound or injury that is not apparent, as from a snake bite,  or it may be from a disease, like cancer in an organ, leukemia, or a number of other diseases. Regardless of the cause, this is a condition that needs to be checked by your veterinarian promptly.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"It will probably take time and several tests to determine what is causing the bleeding. The veterinarian will first need to know if your dog has a reduced number of red blood cells, indicating anemia, and if so, how critical it is. Other tests that will be ordered by your veterinarian are blood analyses to determine whether the blood platelets are normal, a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and tests to determine whether there is bone-marrow disease. To determine whether the bleeding is caused by a coagulation problem, a coagulation profile will also be conducted.
"
"Your veterinarian will also need to determine whether there is evidence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. A thyroid test will be performed, and some x-rays may be required, as well as a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan.
"
"
"
"If your dog is suffering from coagulopathy, it will need to stay in hospital for treatment. If the coagulating problem is caused by a condition like liver disease, the underlying cause will be treated. Do not give your dog non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or any other medication without first consulting your veterinarian. If the cause is a clotting abnormality like hemophilia, a transfusion will be necessary. If your dog is found to be anemic but the bleeding is from a cause other than a coagulating problem, it will probably be given a blood transfusion in the doctor’s office, but you will most likely be able to take your dog home with you. If it is determined that a platelet problem is causing the bleeding, the anti-inflammatory prednisone may be prescribed. For an infectious disease, doxycycline is often prescribed to be given over a three- to six-week term. For bone-marrow tumor growth (neoplasia), chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be prescribed. If the bleeding is caused by a bacterial infection, your veterinarian will prescribe antibiotics.
"
"Conversely, the bleeding may be based on conditions in the nasal passages. If the bleeding is coming from tumors in the nasal passages, your veterinarian will determine the course of treatment. Radiotherapy is one possible treatment of choice, but if the bleeding is caused by a foreign body in the nasal passages that is not removable by probing, surgery may be necessary. If there is fungus in the nasal passages, surgery may be required to removed some of it in order for further treatment to take place. For a fungal infection, medication prescribed by your veterinarian for the specific fungus will need to be applied through the nasal cavity.
"
"In case of serious hemorrhage, your dog should be kept in a cage to lower blood pressure and promote clotting. Nasal sprays (approved by your veterinarian) of diluted epinephrine may help. Once your dog returns home, it should be kept calm and anything excitable should be avoided in order to prevent hemorrhaging episodes. Your veterinarian will educate you about what to watch for in case of a serious hemorrhage, such as weakness, collapse, pallor, or the loss of large amounts of blood.

"Symptoms for nasal adenocarcinoma can sometimes mimic symptoms caused by: 
"
"Allergies 
"
"Fungal infections 
"
"Foreign material lodged in the nasal passages 
"
"Although the exact cause for nasal adenocarcinoma is considered idiopathic (unknown), risks appear to increase with exposure to tobacco smoke, kerosene, coal combustion and other airborne pollutants. Due to these types of exposures, dogs in urban environments, especially dogs with longer noses, tend to have higher incidences of this cancer. Flea sprays has also been correlated with the development of nasal tumors in dogs.  
"
" Breeds that are predisposed to nasal adenocarcinoma include: 
"
"Airedale Terriers 
"
"Poodles 
"
"Basset Hounds 
"
"Scottish Terriers 
"
"Collies 
"
"Sheepdogs 
"
"German Shorthair Pointers 
"
"Labrador and Golden Retrievers 
"
"When a tumor is suspected, a veterinarian will recommend CT scans and radiographs (x-rays). CT scanning is usually the preferred method to confirm a diagnosis of invasive nasal neoplasia.  
"
"Following the scans, the vet will perform a tissue biopsy (a process called histopathology) to identify the type of cancer. The biopsy is taken from the nasal passage by using surgical equipment to extract the tumor sample.  
"
"Further x-rays may be taken to determine if the tumor has spread (metastasized) to surrounding areas. Other tests may include taking samples from lymph nodes. 
"
"Unfortunately, nasal adenocarcinoma is usually advanced by the time it’s diagnosed, so surgery to remove the tumors completely, is often not possible. The gold standard for treatment is radiation therapy with adjunctive surgery and chemotherapy. 
"
"Radiation therapy may require more than 20 treatments to shrink tumors. Therapy may also include radiosurgery, which is when the tumor’s center is attacked with a high dose of radiation to reduce damage to healthy tissue. The treatment may be a single dose or several smaller doses depending on your dog’s specific tumor characteristics. 
"
"Although side effects are often minimal and temporary, a pet parent may notice a permanent change in their dog’s fur color, as well as skin peeling or ulceration.  
"
"Although nasal adenocarcinoma is rarely cured, radiation therapy can push the disease into remission. Dogs can enjoy a good quality of life, with a survival rate of roughly 2 years or more. 
"
"Some plastic surgery may be necessary after treatment because the therapies used in treatment can destroy facial tissue.  
"
"Dogs that do not undergo a treatment for their nasal adenocarcinoma have a life expectancy of about three to five months after their diagnosis.  
"
"Without treatment, the average survival time for dogs is about 3 to 5 months after a diagnosis of nasal adenocarcinoma.
"
"Yes, this cancer can be extremely painful and can interfere with eating and breathing.
"
"Nasal adenocarcinoma is extremely aggressive where it occurs, but it does not typically spread to other areas of the body.
"
"While radiation therapy can shrink tumors and improve quality of life, the disease is rarely cured. Survival time after appropriate treatment can be close to 2 years. However, in some cases dogs can live longer. A dog who lives 4 to 5 years after treatment can be considered cured.

"Keratitis is a term used to describe inflammation of the cornea, the clear outer layer of the eye. Non- ulcerative keratitis describes an inflammatory process in the cornea.
"
"A dog’s eye is made up of several tissue layers and anatomical structures. A dog’s eyelid is similar to those of humans, except for the nictitating membrane, or third eyelid. Just below the eyelid is the eyeball, or globe, which houses many structures necessary for vision.
"
"Large structures that can be seen without specialized equipment include the cornea, the surrounding white tissue (sclera), the colored portion (iris), and the dark pupil in the center of the eye. With non-ulcerative keratitis, the cornea is the portion of the eye affected.
"
"Acute non-ulcerative keratitis may not involve any obvious changes to the cornea at first, but in some cases it may be possible to notice a subtle cloudiness or haziness to the eye. When the condition becomes more chronic, buildup of dark pigmentation on the cornea begins. In contrast, ulcerative keratitis involves a disruption in the top layer of the cornea, which may or may not be visible with the naked eye and is diagnosed by your veterinarian.
"
"There are several types of non-ulcerative keratitis in dogs, including:
"
"These conditions may require different treatments, and which is why diagnosis and testing is so important.
"

"
"Visual symptoms of non-ulcerative keratitis include:
"
"Nonspecific symptoms of non-ulcerative keratitis include:
"
"There are several possible causes of non-ulcerative keratitis in dogs, and determining the correct one affects prognosis and treatment goals. The most common causes of non-ulcerative keratitis include:
"
"Diagnosis of non-ulcerative keratitis typically starts with a basic physical exam as well as blood work, urinalysis, and possibly x-rays to make sure there are no underlying reasons for the inflammation outside of the eye. Testing specific to the eyes includes:
"
"Treatment of non-ulcerative keratitis depends on the underlying cause of the inflammation. Common therapies include:
"
"While there are a lot of home remedies available for eye infections in dogs, it is important to consult with your veterinarian prior to usage. Many homeopathic medications are not FDA-approved and using them may delay healing and worsen clinical signs.
"
"The timeline of recovery depends on the underlying cause of the inflammation. Many dogs with non-ulcerative keratitis require lifelong therapies if the condition is related to an auto-immune disease or chronic superficial inflammation (pannus). In cases of trauma, infection, and confirmational causes like trichiasis, full recovery is possible once the underlying cause is addressed and treated.
"
"It may not be possible to fully prevent non-ulcerative keratitis, as some dogs are predisposed to this condition. For example, brachycephalic breeds are more at risk for trauma and secondary infections. Cocker Spaniels are at high risk for the development of dry eye, and German Shepherds are known to develop pannus. Although complete prevention may not be possible, talking with your veterinarian as soon as you notice any abnormalities is the first step in preventing progression of the disease.
"
"If no ulceration is present, your vet may recommend anti-inflammatories, such as topical steroids, along with antibiotics and lubrication as needed.
"
"Inflammation is secondary to irritation, infection, or immune stimulation.
"
"While there is some crossover between human and dog eye medications, some are dangerous to use, depending on the underlying disease. Talk to your veterinarian prior to starting any topical or oral medications.
"
"At this time, at-home treatment without consultation with a veterinarian is not recommended. Inappropriate treatments may put your dog at risk for worsening of disease and permanent vision loss.

"Unusually loud breathing sounds are often the result of air passing through abnormally narrowed passageways, meeting resistance to airflow because of partial blockage of these regions. The origin may be the back of the throat (nasopharynx), the throat (pharynx), the voice box (larynx), or the windpipe (trachea). Abnormal breathing sounds of this type can be heard without using a stethoscope.
"
"Stertor is noisy breathing that occurs during inhalation. It is a low-pitched, snoring type of sound that usually arises from the vibration of fluid, or the vibration of tissue that is relaxed or flabby. It usually arises from airway blockage in the throat (pharynx).
"
"Stridor is high-pitched, noisy breathing. The higher-pitched sounds result when relatively rigid tissues vibrate with the passage of air. It often occurs as the result of partial or complete blockage of the nasal passages or voice box (larynx), or collapse of the upper part of the windpipe (known as cervical tracheal collapse).
"
"The upper respiratory tract or upper airways includes the nose, nasal passages, throat (pharynx), and windpipe (trachea).
"
"Noisy breathing is common in short-nosed, flat-faced (brachycephalic) dog breeds. Inherited paralysis of the voice box, known as laryngeal paralysis, has been identified in Bouviers des Flandres, Siberian huskies, bulldogs, and Dalmatians.
"
"Acquired paralysis of the voice box (laryngeal paralysis) is more common in certain giant-breed dogs, such as St. Bernards and Newfoundlands, and in large-breed dogs, such as Irish setters, Labrador retrievers, and golden retrievers, than other breeds.
"
"Affected short-nosed, flat-faced dogs with inherited paralysis of the voice box typically are younger than one year of age when breathing problems are first detected. Acquired paralysis of the voice box typically occurs in older dogs. Inherited paralysis of the voice box has a 3:1 male-to-female ratio.
"
"Risk Factors
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your pet's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will use a stethoscope to listen to the entire area from the pharynx to the trachea. If the sound persists when your pet opens its mouth, a nasal cause can virtually be ruled out. If the sound occurs only during expiration, it is likely that airway narrowing is the cause. If the abnormal sounds are loudest during inspiration, they are from disease other than in the chest. If you have noticed a change in your dog's voice, the larynx is the likely abnormal site. Your veterinarian will systematically listen with the stethoscope over the nose, pharynx, larynx, and trachea to identify the point of maximal intensity of any abnormal sound and to identify the phase of respiration when it is most obvious. It is important to identify the location from which the abnormal sound arises and to seek aggravating causes.
"
"Internal imaging techniques, such as radiography and fluoroscopy, are important for assessing the cardiorespiratory system and to rule out other or additional causes of respiratory difficulty. Such conditions may add to an underlying upper airway obstruction, causing a subclinical condition to become clinical. X-rays of the head and neck may help to identify abnormal soft tissues of the airway. A computed tomography (CT) scan may also be used to provide additional anatomic detail.
"
"In some cases, your dog's physiological inheritance can make the diagnosis more apparent, such as with dogs that are brachycephalic. In these situations, your veterinarian will determine the location that is being most affected by your dog's conformation and decide where to go from there.
"
"
"
"Keep your dog cool, quiet, and calm. Anxiety, exertion, and pain can lead to increased movement of air into and out of the lungs, potentially worsening the airflow. Low levels of oxygen in the blood and tissues, and decreased movement of air into and out of the lungs occur with prolonged, severe blockage to airflow; supplemental oxygen is not always critical for sustaining patients with partial airway collapse. In addition closely monitor the effects of sedatives that have been prescribed, as sedatives are known for relaxing the upper airway muscles and worsening the blockage to airflow. Be prepared for emergency treatment if complete obstruction occurs.
"
"Extreme airway blockage or obstruction may require an emergency intubation (that is, passage of an endotracheal tube through the mouth and into the windpipe [trachea] to allow oxygen to reach the lungs). If obstruction prevents intubation, an emergency tracheotomy (a surgical opening into the windpipe [trachea]) or passage of a tracheal catheter to administer oxygen) may be the only available means for sustaining life. However, a tracheal catheter can sustain oxygenation only briefly while a more permanent solution is sought. Surgery may be required if a biopsy has indicated a mass in the airways.
"
"Avoid strenuous exercise, high ambient temperatures, and extreme excitement. Your veterinarian will advise you on the correct level of exercise to encourage in your dog.
"
"Your dog's breathing rate and effort will need to be monitored closely. Complete blockage or obstruction could occur after an apparently stable patient is taken home or if continual observation is not feasible. Even with surgical treatment, some degree of obstruction may remain for 7 to 10 days due to postoperative swelling. Care will need to be taken during this time to protect your dog from complications due to labored breathing.
"
"After surgery, your dog may feel sore and will need proper rest in a quiet place, away from other pets and active children. You might consider cage rest for a short time, until your dog can safely move about again without overexertion. Your veterinarian will also prescribe a short course of pain killers until your dog has fully recovered, along with a mild course of antibiotics, to prevent any opportunistic bacteria from attacking your dog. Medications will need to be given precisely as directed, at the proper dosage and frequency. Keep in mind that over dosage of pain medications is one of the most preventable causes for death in household animals.

"Non-inflammatory hereditary myotonia is a muscle disease characterized by persistent contraction or delayed relaxation of muscles, especially during movement. Although it can be acquired later in life -- often experimentally induced with ingestion of herbicides -- this article pertains to congenital myotonia, which is often seen in chow chows and miniature schnauzers.
"
"The symptoms below are commonly associated with non-inflammatory hereditary myotonia; they may improve after exercise and/or worsen due to the cold:
"
"This type of non-inflammatory myopathy is hereditary; i.e., it is inherited by a mother and/or father with the same sarcolemmal defect, which affects the cell membrane of a muscle cell.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Creatine kinase enzyme levels may be elevated due to the dystrophin deficiency. Liver enzymes are also elevated in dogs with this disorder.
"
"During the examination, your veterinarian will tap on the surface of the dog's tongue, both while conscious and while anesthetized. Such tapping produce sustained dimpling on the surface of tongue, which will provide a clue for diagnosis. For further confirmation, a DNA-based test is available to detect affected and carrier miniature schnauzers.
"
"
"
"Although there is no specific course of treatment for non-inflammatory hereditary myotonia, there are certain medications (procainamide, quinidine, phenytoin, mexiletine) that help in decreasing the muscular stiffness and regurgitation. This, however, does not improve the abnormal gait associated with the disorder.
"
"Discourage your dog from strenuous activities or exercise that may increase its respiration, and avoid cold, which may exacerbate the symptoms. Unfortunately, even with treatment, the overall prognosis of a dog with non-inflammatory hereditary myotonia is very poor. Your veterinarian will also recommend against breeding the dog to prevent further progression of the disease to the next generation.

"This form of non-inflammatory myopathy is a type of muscle disease caused by endocrine maladies such as hypo- and hyperthyroidism. However, non-inflammatory myopathy of endocrine origin has also been associated with corticosteroid use.
"
" 
"
" 
"
" 
"
"Ultimately, this type of non-inflammatory myopathy is due to an endocrine disorder -- such as hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism -- but may be immune-mediated or neoplastic in nature.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) to determine the type of endocrine disorder. Your veterinarian will also conduct thyroid and adrenal gland functions tests to confirm the diagnosis.
"
" 
"
"X-rays are conducted to evaluate pharyngeal and esophageal functions -- especially in patients with regurgitation and dysphagia -- while muscle samples are sent to veterinary pathologist for further evaluation.
"
" 

"
" 
"
"Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of this disease. However, if the disease is due to an adverse reaction to corticosteroids, your veterinarian will adjust the dose or stop the corticosteroid administration altogether, which usually help in resolving the symptoms. Surgery may also be required in non-inflammatory myopathy cases with tumors.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"Dogs with this disorder will require special feeding techniques. You will briefed about elevating feeding and adding various foods to the dog's diet, especially foods of different consistencies. In cases of severe regurgitation, your veterinarian will place a feeding tube into the dog's stomach to ensure proper nutrition. He or she will also show you how to use the feeding tube correctly, and will assist in setting up a feeding schedule. In addition, dogs may need physical therapy to strengthen their muscles and reduce wasting and weakness.
"
"

"
"Overall prognosis depends on the underlying cause and extent of disease. If the disease is due to an adverse reaction to corticosteroids, for example, prognosis is positive if the treatment is stopped immediately. Muscle strength and mass should normalize within a few weeks.

"Neuropathic pain commonly results from an injury or disease relating to the body’s nerves and how they function, or within the spinal cord itself. This particular kind of pain is difficult to pinpoint, especially in patients that are unable to respond to specific inducements.
"
"Damage to the tissues of the body, and the nerves running through them, creates a constant (chronic) pain that is brought on by a light touch to the affected area and/or a heightened perception of pain. Pain originating within the spinal cord causes problems with mobility and various functions of the body.
"
"Some of the symptoms of neuropathic pain may include:
"
"Neuropathic pain may result from an injury to body tissues or a growth (tumor) in the spinal cord. Diseases that affect the spinal cord, such as intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), may cause pain in different areas of the body, depending on which part of the cord is affected. Another potential cause of neuropathic pain is amputation of a limb. Phantom limb pain results in the impression of pain coming from a leg that has been surgically removed.
"
"In general, neuropathic pain is diagnosed by ruling out other causes of pain and performing reflex tests to evaluate the nervous system. Basic blood tests can help rule out infectious and disease-related causes. X-rays and special imaging may be necessary to search for tumors in the bone or spinal cord. Finally, a good discussion of your dog's medical history and previous symptoms will help lead to the proper diagnosis.
"
"
"
"Analgesic medications (those that relieve pain) are used as the initial treatment for neuropathic pain. The amount given may need to be changed until the best effect is achieved. Other types of pain relievers may be tried until the one that works best for your dog is found. Some veterinarians may choose to use several pain medications at one time and then taper off until only one is being given.
"
"One medication that has been used with success for long-term pain is gabapentin. This anti-seizure drug has analgesic properties that are particularly effective for reducing neuropathic pain in dogs. Gabapentin is given once daily for pain control and can be given with or without food. The particular side effects of this drug include sedation, weight gain and stumbling (ataxia). Diarrhea may also be seen in some animals.
"
"Dogs with chronic pain may gain considerable relief from analgesic medications. The quality of life for these animals can be much improved, as long as the underlying condition causing the pain is under control.
"
"In dogs with kidney problems, the dosage of gabapentin may be reduced, as the drug is processed through the kidneys and they must be functioning properly for the drug to be removed from the body. Animals that are pregnant should not be treated with gabapentin. When discontinuing the medication, gabapentin should be slowly tapered off to prevent seizures from occurring after long-term use.

"Your dog’s nervous system is the “control center” that controls everything from automatic functions like breathing and metabolic regulation to higher-order thinking that gives your dog their unique personality.
"
"Problems in the nervous system can range from physical disorders to those that affect your dog’s cognition and ability to understand and follow commands.
"
"Read on to understand more about your dog’s nervous system and how to recognize when something is wrong. 
"
"The nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. These organs and systems work together to regulate your dog’s overall physical, mental, and emotional health.
"
"The brain is the main cognitive organ in the body. It’s divided into three main regions:
"
"Brain stem–Controls basic life-sustaining functions, like breathing or digesting food, without having to think about it
"
"Cerebrum—Higher thinking occurs here, like learning how to sit on command or house-training
"
"Cerebellum—Controls all movement and motor activity, like walking or jumping
"
"The spinal cord connects to the base of the brain, then travels down the spinal column along the back to the tail. The spinal cord consists of bundles of nerve fibers that carry impulses to and from the brain. This includes sensory input from the rest of the body (e.g., Is it hot or cold? Am I being petted?) and commands from the brain that control movement and other physical functions.
"
"The nervous system includes all the nerves that shoot off from the spinal cord and travel to every part of the dog’s body. Some nerves carry messages from the body to the spinal cord, so they can be transmitted to the brain and acted on. Other nerves carry messages from the brain with commands for the body, like barking at a worrisome neighbor or moving a paw off hot asphalt.
"
"A dog’s nervous system can be separated into two distinct but related systems:
"
"Central nervous system (CNS)—This includes the brain and spinal cord and all the nerves within them. These nerves can be further divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic functions. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for all systems related to “fight or flight,” including the heart, blood vessels, lungs, and muscles. When a dog sees an animal they want to chase, their sympathetic nervous system may activate.
"
"Peripheral nervous system (PNS)—The PNS includes all the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. It’s often thought of as “rest and digest.” These nerves activate when an animal is relaxed, like during digestion.

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Disorders in the nervous system can cause subtle symptoms, like muscle twitches or mild pain, or severe symptoms, like seizures or paralysis. Some of the many signs that might indicate a neurological disorder in dogs include:
"
"Lack of coordination (ataxia)
"
"Knuckling over of the feet
"
"Unusual, rapid eye movements (nystagmus)
"
"Head tilt or circling
"
"Difficulty walking
"
"Inappropriate mental activity
"
"Seizures
"
"Muscle tremors, twitching, or trembling
"
"Weakness in the back end
"
"Disorientation
"
"Neurological conditions are commonly caused by genetic disorders, and some breeds are more prone to them. They can also be caused by cancer, trauma, and toxins.
"
"Brain tumors may be the root cause of a dog’s seizures or behavior changes. Spinal tumors can look like intervertebral disc disease, with back pain and weakness in the hind end or difficulty walking. Ingesting toxins, like chocolate and antifreeze, can lead to seizures, stumbling, and lack of coordination. Being hit by a car or other trauma can lead to brain and spinal issues.
"
"The following are some of the most common neurologic disorders in dogs:
"
"Intervertebral Disc Disease
"
"Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) occurs when the disc material inside a dog’s spine starts bulging or ruptures. This compresses the spinal cord beneath the disc, disrupting the nerves that connect to the spinal cord.
"
"While IVDD can occur in any breed, it is most common in dogs with long backs that structurally have less stability in their spine, such as Dachshunds, Basset Hounds, Cocker Spaniels, French Bulldogs, and Beagles.
"
"Dogs affected with IVDD may seem like they’re in pain, not wanting to jump on furniture or use the stairs. They may also be more severely affected, knuckling over and walking on the tops of their paws, and they can even lose the ability to walk and use their back end.
"
"Some cases of IVDD can be managed medically with anti-inflammatories and strict rest, but other cases may require surgery to allow a dog to walk again and urinate on their own. If the nerves that control urination and defecation branch from the spinal cord near the area of the damaged disc, the dog may not be able to urinate on their own.
"
"Seizures
"
"A seizure is a surge of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain. It is often accompanied by jerking physical movements, or convulsions. When dogs have a seizure, they are mentally unaware and often lose control of their bladder or bowels. Seizures can be caused by certain toxins, an underlying illness like liver disease, a brain tumor, trauma, or genetics.
"
"The most commonly diagnosed cause of seizures is an inherited condition called idiopathic epilepsy. Epilepsy is usually treated with long-term medications like levetiracetam, phenobarbital, or potassium bromide.
"
"Once a pet goes on seizure medications, they’re usually on them for life. Keeping a journal of any seizure episodes is recommended to identify patterns that may come before seizures.
"
"If your dog has a seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes, or cluster seizures (more than three in 24 hours), they should be seen immediately by an emergency veterinarian because they’re at risk for brain damage and death.
"
"Vestibular disease
"
"Vestibular disease is a sudden loss of balance and coordination. Dogs with this disease are often unable to walk, may circle in one direction, have a head tilt, or experience uncontrolled jerking eye movements called nystagmus. Many times they will not eat, and they may vomit due to the nausea that accompanies the spinning, unbalanced sensation.
"
"This disease is more common in senior dogs and may be caused by a middle or inner ear infection. More often than not, there is no underlying cause that can be found. Fortunately, vestibular disease often resolves with time. Usually, the worst symptoms lessen after the first two or three days and are gone within a few weeks.
"
"Vestibular disease is usually managed with medications to help combat nausea, like Cerenia®, and supportive care to help affected dogs eat, drink, and go to the bathroom outside.
"
"Cognitive Dysfunction
"
"Cognitive dysfunction, commonly referred to as dementia, is an age-related change in a dog’s brain that occurs in some senior dogs.
"
"Dogs with cognitive dysfunction will often get lost in their own home. Sometimes they get stuck in corners or will bark at things that are not there. Often they will seem disoriented and confused in the evening before bed.
"
"Cognitive dysfunction cannot be cured but is usually managed or slowed down with a combination of medication, supplements, and diet therapy. Some dogs are prescribed selegiline or put on diets like Hills b/d or Purina Neurocare. Affected dogs may benefit from light physical activity and brain-engaging interactions, like walks or treat puzzles. 
"
"Schwannomas are tumors that originate in the myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is produced by the Schwann cell, a specialized cell which surrounds the peripheral nerves, providing mechanical and physical support for the nerves as well as insulating the nerves that transmit the nervous system’s electrical signals. The peripheral nervous system consists of the nerves outside of the central nervous system (brain and spine). Peripheral nerve sheath tumor is the term that has been proposed to include schwannomas, neurofibromas (nerve fiber tumors), neurofibrosarcomas (malignant nerve fiber tumors), and hemangiopericytoma (tumor of blood vessels and soft tissue), since they are all believed to arise from the same cell type.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. A computed tomography (CT) or, ideally, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide the most information regarding the extent and location of the disease. An electromyogram (a measurement of muscle activity) will show abnormal muscle activity if there is a schwannoma present.
"
"
"
"The treatment of choice is surgical removal (excision) of the tumor. Amputation of the affected limb is usually necessary, and local recurrence after surgery is common. A laminectomy (surgery of the spine to relieve pressure) is indicated with a schwannoma involving the nerve roots. Radiotherapy may be helpful, dependent on how far the growth has gone, and should be discussed with your veterinarian.
"
"After surgical excision of schwannoma, 72 percent of all cases will have a recurrence. If this type of tumor affects the limb, the closer to the paw the schwannoma is, the easier it will be to treat. Schwannomas only rarely spread to the regional lymph nodes or to the lungs, staying mainly in the nerve cells.

"Wobbler Syndrome
"
"Wobbler syndrome, or cervical spondylomyelopathy, is a disease of the neck that causes an uncoordinated gait, dragging of the feet, and extreme neck pain. It can affect any breed of dog, but it’s most common in Doberman Pinschers and other large-breed dogs like Great Danes, Weimaraners, and Rottweilers.
"
"It’s the result of compression on the spinal cord in the neck. The condition may be managed surgically or medically. Medical treatment includes rest and anti-inflammatory pain medications like carprofen or medications for nerve pain like gabapentin. 
"
"Degenerative Myelopathy
"
"Degenerative myelopathy, or DM, is a disease of the spinal cord that leads to weakness in the back end and eventual paralysis. It is most common in older German Shepherds and often looks like arthritis or hip dysplasia. Affected dogs may be weaker in the back end, drag their feet when walking, and have trouble getting up from lying down.
"
"It is believed to be caused by a genetic mutation, similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in humans. While there is no treatment for this condition, keeping affected pets active and at a healthy weight can slow the progression of the disease. Many pets benefit from pain medications because they often have underlying arthritis as well.
"
"Meningitis, Encephalitis, and Encephalomyelitis
"
"When inflammation occurs in the brain, spinal cord, or membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, it’s called encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, or meningitis, respectively.
"
"Affected dogs may have symptoms like a fever, head tilt or head pressing, circling, lack of balance and difficulty walking, muscle tremors, blindness, and seizures. This condition may be a result of a bacteria, virus, fungi, parasite, or an autoimmune condition.
"
"These conditions are usually diagnosed by a veterinary neurologist after an MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. They are treated with medications to kill the infectious agent, if one is present, and to reduce inflammation around the brain, spinal cord, and membranes.
"
"If your dog is showing signs of a neurological disorder, the first thing your veterinarian will want to do is collect a thorough history. Let them know about potential exposure to toxins, including behavior like getting into trash or unfamiliar areas, or any possible trauma.
"
"If your dog is having seizures, the vet may ask these questions:
"
"How long did the seizure episode(s) last?
"
"When was the first seizure episode?
"
"How many seizures have they had?
"
"Exactly what did your dog do during the episode? Did they have convulsions, lose consciousness, or lose control of their bladder?
"
"It can be very helpful to take a video of your dog’s unusual behavior to show the vet.
"
"After a physical examination, your veterinarian will likely want to run some tests, including blood work and X-rays. Spinal fluid taps may be recommended. During this procedure, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is collected to look for signs of infection or cancer.
"
"The vet may recommend that your dog see a veterinary neurologist. In addition to having a wealth of knowledge about neurologic disease, these specialists have access to advanced imaging like CT scans and MRIs, which are very helpful when trying to see structures like the spinal cord, discs, or the brain.
"
"Treatment will depend on the nature of the neurologic disorder and may include lifestyle modifications, medications, or surgery.
"
"Medication is the most common type of treatment for most neurological disorders in dogs. Seizure disorders are treated with anti-epileptic drugs that must be given for the remainder of a dog’s life. Monitoring is usually necessary to make dose changes required over time, so regular bloodwork and exams may be recommended.
"
"Many dogs with spinal cord compression will benefit from anti-inflammatory medications such as steroids. Steroids have some side effects, including increased thirst, increased urination, increased appetite, and panting.
"
"If your dog is put on steroids, be sure to let them out more frequently to urinate so they’re not having accidents in the house. Watch their diet and control their food portions, as increased appetite can lead to overeating and weight gain, which can worsen the underlying neurologic disease and shorten their lifespan.
"
"There are some supplements and nutritional therapies on the market that can be helpful for various neurological disorders. SAMe, which helps reduce inflammation, may benefit some pets. Commercial diets like Purina Neurocare and Hills b/d have been shown to slow progression of cognitive dysfunction and reduce frequency of seizure episodes.
"
"Surgeries are done by a neurology specialist and require advanced diagnostics, like CT or MRI, prior to surgery. Surgery on the back, neck, or brain can be expensive, but it may be your pet’s best option. Make sure you understand all the costs involved and be sure to follow the post-operative instructions. Oftentimes, follow-up visits can be done with your pet’s regular veterinarian.
"
"Some neurological disorders are very common and can be managed to preserve your dog’s quality of life. Other conditions may be unusual and require a diagnostic journey and a neurology specialist to get answers.
"
"If your pet is prescribed medication, it’s important to follow the instructions as labeled. If you notice any unexpected or concerning side effects, call your veterinarian right away. Some medications, like phenobarbital, may lead to dramatic initial side effects, like wobbling and stumbling, that subside over time. Your veterinarian is the best person to explain medication side effects and adjustments.
"
"Many neurological disorders are inherited, making prevention difficult. If you have a Dachshund or another breed prone to IVDD, you can help by changing your environment and working with your dog to reduce risky behaviors.
"
"Teach your dog to use steps or a ramp to get up on the bed or couch, rather than leaping up and down. Keep your pet at an ideal body condition, as obesity has been linked to an increased risk of morbidity with many neurological disorders. And make sure your pet has no access to toxins—keep dangerous pesticides, human food, and prescription medications safely stored away.

"Neuroaxonal dystrophy (NAD) in dogs is an inherited condition that affects the nervous system. It’s present in some dogs at birth, but it may also develop later in a dog’s life.
"
"A dog’s nervous system sends signals between their brain and other parts of their body, allowing for movement, thoughts, and essential body functions like breathing.
"
"The nerve cells that make up the nervous system comprise three main parts: the cell body, dendrites, and axon. The cell body is the command center of the cell. The dendrites extend from the cell body, receiving signals from other cells. The axon carries nerve impulses away from the cell body, transmitting these signals to other cells.
"
"Neuroaxonal dystrophy is the severe swelling of axons throughout the nervous system. These swollen areas on the axons are called spheroids. Changes to the axons affect the ability for cells to send signals to each other, which can cause neurological dysfunction.
"
"NAD is considered a very rare disorder in dogs. If your dog is having symptoms of a neurologic disease, other causes like granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME) or distemper are more common. Your veterinarian will rule out other health conditions to determine a diagnosis.
"
"NAD is a progressive disease, but it’s typically not a medical emergency when first noticed. If you’re concerned that your pet may be developing symptoms of NAD, contact your vet for an appointment. If you’re noticing paralysis, sudden blindness, or an inability to walk, these are cases in which you should seek emergency care.
"
"Symptoms of NAD in dogs are often mild at first, but they progress. ending with paralysis and blindness.
"
"The speed of symptom progression varies. In some cases, particularly with dogs who are diagnosed as puppies, symptoms usually progress quickly over weeks or months. Dogs that are diagnosed as young adults sometimes have a slower progression that can last more than a year.
"
"Signs may include:
"
"NAD in dogs is caused by a gene mutation and is an autosomal recessive condition— meaning a puppy must inherit a copy of the mutated gene from both of their parents to develop the disease. In some breeds, the underlying genetic cause has yet to be determined.
"
"Dogs that inherit the mutated gene from one parent will be carriers of the condition but won’t develop signs of NAD. However, if they were to breed with another dog that was a carrier of the mutated gene, they could pass on the disease to their pups.
"
"If you are intending to breed your dog, it’s highly recommended that you get your dog genetically tested for conditions they could pass on to their puppies.
"
"In some breeds, symptoms begin to show within a few months of birth. However, in some cases, NAD onset occurs when the dog is over a year old, which has been reported in Rottweilers.
"
"Many cases that begin early in life are rapidly progressive over the course of weeks to months, while slightly older dogs may have a slower progression lasting months to years.
"
"Even in breeds with known cases of NAD, the condition is rare. These breeds include:
"
"Jack Russell Terriers
"
"Chihuahuas
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Papillons
"
"Dachshunds
"
"Rottweilers
"
"Giant Schnauzers
"
"Border Collies
"
"Boxers
"
"Spanish Water Dogs
"
"NAD is an extremely rare condition in dogs. Your veterinarian will likely start by ruling out other conditions before testing for NAD. Much of this testing is performed at a specialty clinic.
"
"Recommended tests may include:
"
"Urinalysis
"
"Blood tests
"
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord
"
"Computed tomography (CT) of the brain and spinal cord
"
"Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is the fluid around the brain and spinal cord, for evidence of inflammation or infection
"
"Infectious disease testing, to determine if the dog has distemper virus
"
"If your dog is a breed with a higher chance of being predisposed to NAD; your veterinarian may want to discuss genetic testing if it’s an option. These tests usually require a blood or cheek swab.
"
"There is no cure for neuroaxonal dystrophy in dogs.
"
"Some veterinarians may prescribe anti-inflammatory medications like carprofen or steroids like prednisone to reduce inflammation.  If your pet is experiencing rigidity or muscle spasms, some veterinarians may try muscle relaxants like methocarbamol.
"
"However, there is currently no standard medical treatment that reliably improves NAD symptoms. Instead, management of NAD is focused on keeping the pet comfortable in the home.
"
"Since NAD cannot be cured in dogs, management is focused on supportive care, including altering your home to create a safe environment for your pet.
"
"Because your dog may have difficulty walking, running, and jumping, you may consider placing non-slip matts on hard floors to prevent slipping. Using ramps to help your dog with furniture or car rides may also be helpful.
"
"Vision is sometimes affected, so try to avoid moving around furniture to ensure your pup can walk safely in their home.  
"
"Dogs don’t recover from NAD. Dogs diagnosed as puppies usually decline within several weeks to months and are humanely euthanized. Dogs diagnosed as young adults may have a slower progression. Occasionally, these dogs live for over a year, but neurological decline typically results in humane euthanasia.
"
"Since NAD is a genetic condition, pet parents can’t prevent NAD in their pets. Adult dogs over two years old without symptoms are extremely unlikely to develop NAD.
"
"To lessen the risk of bringing home a dog with NAD, pet parents can choose to adopt mixed breed dogs from shelters or dogs from reputable breeders.
"
"If you’re planning to adopt from a breeder and know the breed has an available test for NAD, ask the breeder if they have tested the dog’s parents for the NAD genetic mutation. If they don’t test for NAD, you could see if they are willing to either get the parents or the pet tested before you bring home your new pet.

"Polyneuropathy is a nerve disorder that affects multiple peripheral nerves. Unlike the central nervous system, which has the vertebrae of the spine, and the bone of the skull to protect it, the peripheral nerves are more exposed to the elements that enter into the body and come into contact with the body, so they are more susceptible to physical injury and toxic damage. They are spread over the entire body, and are responsible for conscious, coordinated movement (somatic), for automatic physical responses (autonomic), and for the movement of the digestive system (enteric).
"
"Myelin, the white, fatty, lipid material that acts as an insulator coat (also called a sheath) for some nerve fibers, can be lost through a process called demyelination, a condition that causes the myelin to deteriorate, resulting in electrical signals in the nerves being lost, and impairing function. Or, there may be axonal degeneration with secondary demyelination. Axonal degeneration occurs when the actual nerve fibers deteriorate within the myelin sheath.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis will be used for confirming, or for ruling out any underlying diseases. Your veterinarian may also opt to perform additional blood tests, and a spinal tap, to look for specific disorders.
"
"Chest and abdominal x-rays can be crucial for diagnosing visible peripheral polyneuropathies. X-ray and ultrasound imaging can help to rule out (or confirm) cancer, but the most important diagnostic tool for identifying peripheral neuropathies is electrophysiology – measuring the electrical flow of the body's tissues and cells. An analysis of tissue sample (biopsy) from the muscles or peripheral nerves can provide further information about the disease process your dog is experiencing.
"
" 
"
"Animals can usually be treated on an outpatient basis. However, dogs with acute polyradiculoneuropathies will have inflammation at the roots of the spinal cord nerves, and are at risk of respiratory failure. They should be hospitalized for observation in the early phase of the disease to prevent this. Dogs with dysautonomia should be hospitalized to receive fluid therapy and/or administered (parenteral) feeding. 
"
"Dogs with hyperchylomicronemia, conversely, may spontaneously recover after two to three months of being fed a low-fat diet. Dogs that have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus should have their blood glucose and diet closely monitored.
"
"An excellent related treatment for patients with peripheral polyneuropathies is physiotherapy, for encouraging restoration of the affected musculature and nerve memory.
"
"It is important to understand that the cause of many polyneuropathies can never be determined, and treatment of the primary cause of polyneuropathy may not cure your dog. In some cases, the peripheral nerves will continue to deteriorate, and your dog's disease will worsen.
"
"Dogs that have been diagnosed with congenital or inherited forms of polyneuropathies should not be bred. Generally, it is advisable to neuter an animal that is suffering from this condition to prevent accidental breeding. For example, female dogs that have been infected with the Neospora parasite should not be bred, since one of the ways the parasite transmits itself is by spreading to the fetus through the placenta.
"
"Dogs that have developed coonhound paralysis (polyradiculoneuritis) will need to be protected from repeated exposure to raccoons, since the initial infection does not impart later immunity from it.

"Unfortunately, your dog can not tell you where it hurts, and it can be difficult to determine the exact location when your dog has been injured and is in obvious pain. Your veterinarian may even have trouble determining the location. And because there are a number of causes for neck and back pain, zeroing in on the underlying cause may take some time.
"
"  
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and any possible incidents that might have led to this condition. You will need to provide as much detail as possible regarding your dog's health history, the onset of the symptoms and what type of symptoms have been representing, and what might have been the cause of the injury. The doctor will perform baseline blood tests, including a chemical blood profile and a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and a spinal fluid analysis. Other diagnostic tests that may be used for conclusively identifying the origin of the back pain are computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and X-ray imaging of the abdominal and spinal areas. Other essential tests include a neurological exam, and a myelogram, whereby a radiopaque agent is injected into the subarachnoid space in the spine so that the spine and nerves of the spine are more clearly visible on an X-ray image.
"
"
"
"Because the causes for neck and back pain are so varied, the treatment is determined according to the nature of the disease and degree in which the spine's tissues are involved. Depending on the veterinarian's plan, your pet may need to be hospitalized. Treatments can often call for dog pain medication, surgery, or both.
"
"Some possible treatments include anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids, antibiotics, and chemotherapy. Surgery, however, is required in the case of spinal trauma, paralysis, disc or vertebrae infection, and/or cancer located near the spinal cord.
"
"Your pet will require plenty of home care. Make certain you follow the veterinarian's instructions as to medications and follow-up evaluations. Keep track of changes, watch for signs of improvement, and report them to the veterinarian. Avoid moving your pet and don’t let them exercise until it is approved by the veterinarian. Some animals recover well from neck and back pain; however, it’s a condition that can be very serious, even life-threatening.

"Arthritis (or more specifically, osteoarthritis) in dogs is a common condition that occurs in many canines as a result of injury, developmental disorders, or the wear and tear of aging. This painful ailment is caused by abnormal changes in a dog’s joints and results in chronic inflammation. Dogs suffering from arthritis may experience mild discomfort or severe pain but the condition gets worse over time, which makes treatment a priority for pet parents.
"
"As part of their treatment plan, veterinarians will often recommend certain pet prescription pain relief and arthritis management medications or, possibly, a change in diet to help alleviate the symptoms of arthritis in canines. But if you’re searching for an alternative to prescription pain medications, there are natural treatments that may help pet owners manage arthritis pain in their dogs.
"
"Arthritis has varying effects on dogs.
"
"Dr. Clay Bernard, TCVM, of Even Flow Veterinary and Acupuncture in Austin, Texas tells petMD, the signs of arthritis can depend on “the dog's size, age, chronicity of the condition, tolerance for discomfort, his or her immune system, and the extent of his or her activity level.”
"
"Bernard points out that dog parents may notice signs of arthritis including pets who limp or are slower to rise after lying down and less tolerant of long walks. Dogs with arthritis may no longer jump on or off furniture and they may be reluctant to climb the stairs or chase a ball in the backyard.
"
"Dr. Jennifer Luna-Repose of Alternatives For Animals in Lafayette, California, notes that other signs of arthritis in dogs are less obvious. These may include sleeping more than usual, weight gain, loss of muscle mass, depression, or poor appetite.
"
"Some dogs may have different responses to their arthritis in hotter temperatures or cooler temperatures. Pet parents may also notice a change in temperament in arthritic dogs—particularly when they are touched in sensitive areas.
"
"If pet parents think their dogs may have arthritis, a visit to the veterinarian is recommended. “Even the most obvious signs of arthritis can also be the result of other medical conditions,” Luna-Repose points out. “The diagnosis of arthritis should always be made by a veterinarian.”
"
"While your vet knows best, occasionally the pain medications prescribed to dogs suffering from arthritis may have negative effects. Arthritis medication can cause damage to a dog’s internal organs, explains Dr. Darla Rewers, DVM, of the Ancient Arts Holistic Veterinary Team.
"
"“Dogs on arthritis pain meds often need regular bloodwork to check liver and kidney values. NSAIDs and steroids can cause stomach ulcers, too,” she says.
"
"That’s why natural treatments may be an alternative option for concerned pet owners.
"
"The type of natural arthritis product will vary for dogs based on their needs, but there are many alternative medications and dog supplements available. Pet owners should consult a holistic veterinarian or a veterinarian trained in Traditional Chinese Veterinary Herbal Medicine before giving herbs or supplements to their pets. 
"
"Some notable Chinese herbal formulas used to help with arthritis in dogs include Ligusticum (a natural pain reliever), Corydalis (relieves aches and discomfort), and Hindquarter Weakness (an herbal blend that strengthens an animal’s hind legs).
"
"“The ancient Indian herbs, turmeric and boswellia are fantastic anti-inflammatories” Bernard notes, “And so are the omega-3 fatty acids found in krill, sardine, or flaxseed oils. Supplements containing glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM can help preserve and nourish the cartilage that becomes damaged in the affected joints.”
"
"As a natural preventative measure to help ward of arthritis in dogs, Luna-Repose also recommends bone broth as an inexpensive way to help build your dog’s cartilage and protect his joints.
"
"Luna-Repose also recommends that dog owners consider veterinary acupuncture as an option for helping to relieve arthritis pain in pets naturally. “It works by stimulating nerves, increasing blood circulation, relieving muscle spasms, and causing the release of hormones such as endorphins (one of the body’s pain control chemicals) and cortisol (a natural steroid),” she says. In addition, the process is nearly pain free for dogs.
"
"Bernard says that a dog receiving acupuncture treatments to relieve arthritis pain will start experiencing benefits after multiple visits. “The effects start to last longer and longer, and the body returns to balance,” he says.
"
"In addition to natural herbs, supplements and acupuncture treatments, some veterinarians recommend low level laser therapy to assist with arthritis pain in dogs. This procedure, says Luna-Repose, uses specific wavelengths of light to create therapeutic effects. “These effects include improved wound healing time, pain reduction, increased circulation, and decreased swelling,” she says.
"
"Luna-Repose also notes that the FDA-cleared Assisi Loop—which is similar to laser therapy, but can be used at home by pet parents with a prescription—uses targeted Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (tPEMT) to aid in the body’s own natural anti-inflammatory process. “It enhances nitric oxide production to help speed healing of soft and hard tissues including skin, tendons, ligaments, bones, and organs,” she says. TENS (transcutaneous electrical stimulation) or extracorporeal shock wave therapy are other commonly recommended complementary treatments for dogs with arthritis.
"
"Trying canine massage or enrolling your dog in aquatic therapy or other forms of physical therapy may also be options for helping relieve arthritis pain. Pet parents can use professional canine massage therapists or learn massage techniques to try at home. Luna-Repose says that massage therapy can help stimulate circulation, reduce the effects of stress, release endorphins, and reduce trigger points in dogs. In addition, the weight-lessening environment of water can help arthritic dogs stay active and build muscle while swimming or working on an underwater treadmill, she says.
"
"When it comes to any chronic inflammatory condition, a healthy, balanced diet is a key component in recovery and management, especially since dog obesity can be commonly linked to arthritis.
"
"“I always recommend fresh, species-specific food for my patients, like raw or home-cooked diets,” Bernard says. “Probiotics are a must since inflammation in the body often starts with how well food is received by the gut bacteria.” Pet owners should consult their veterinarians before starting their dogs on a raw or home-cooked food since many of these diets have been shown to be contaminated with bacteria and/or nutritionally incomplete.
"
"Keeping your dog as active as possible will also help keep weight off, which is an essential step in managing arthritis pain in dogs. “A heavy body weight means more pressure on the joints,” Rewers says. Even if your dog has difficulty moving, try short, frequent walks or play games—like hide and seek—in the house to keep dogs active.
"
"Any pet parent who is considering natural arthritis treatments for their pets that involve dietary or lifestyle changes should always consult with a trusted veterinarian to determine the best plan for pain management and treatment in your dog.

"In dogs, canine cancers can develop in many locations throughout the body–most commonly they are found in the nasal passages.
"
"Cancer occurs when genes within a cell mutate and the cell continues to divide with the abnormal genes. In most cases, nasal tumors have grown significantly large before they are diagnosed. They are unlikely to spread to other parts of the body (metastasize), but they can be very damaging to the nose and face if left untreated.
"
"Common forms of nasal tumors can be divided into the following types:
 
"
"Adenocarcinomas develop from glands that secrete mucus in the nose and tend not to spread to other parts of the body. However, they can cause a lot of damage to nasal tissue. These are the most common types of nasal tumors, most often seen in medium- to large-sized older dogs (10-12 years) that have long noses.
"
"Sarcomas are tumors occurring in connective tissues within the nasal and surrounding (paranasal) sinuses. Connective tissues are the strong, fibrous tissues found beneath the skin, and include bone, muscle, and cartilage. Sarcomas are named for the area in which they occur:
"
"Chondrosarcomas originate in the nose cartilage and tend to occur in younger dogs, compared to other nasal tumors with an average age of 7 years at the time of diagnosis. Chondrosarcomas tend to occur more often in Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Boxer, and German Shepherd breeds. 
"
"Nasopharyngeal stenosis is a narrowing of one of the four portions of the nasal cavity on either side of nasal septum. Any of the four portions can be affected, which include the common, inferior, middle, and superior portions. The nasal septum is the part of nose that separates the two airways in the nostrils.
"
"The narrowing may occur due to the formation of a thin but tough membrane in the passage of the nasal cavity. Chronic inflammation and subsequent fibrosis (formation of excess fibrous tissue) after an infection is one of the probable causes. Also, inflammation after chronic regurgitation, or vomiting of acidic material may be suspected as a causative factor. This problem is not common in dogs.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including a background medical history and onset of symptoms. After taking a complete history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination, with standard laboratory tests including a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these routine laboratory tests usually return within normal ranges. Outward symptoms will suggest a need for radiographic studies, including X-rays and computed tomography (CT-scan) to diagnose the narrowing of the nasal passage. Your veterinarian may also pass a catheter through nasal passage or use a bronchoscope for further confirmation.
"
"
"
"Surgery is the treatment of choice in affected patients. The membrane will be excised and the wound sutured. A less invasive technique your veterinarian may use is balloon dilatation, by which a small balloon is inserted into the compromised nasal space and then slowly filled with air in order to widen the narrow passage. Balloon dilatation is usually performed using fluoroscopy, which provides real time moving images and simplifies the procedure. If surgery is conducted, antibiotics will be prescribed for few days to prevent infections.
"
"Recurrence is not uncommon in patients that have had nasopharyngeal stenosis, even after successful surgery or balloon dilation treatment. In such cases a second procedure may be necessary for treatment. Watch your dog for any recurrence of symptoms and consult your veterinarian immediately if they should become apparent. Your dog may feel very sore after surgery and may need pain killers for a few days until the wound has healed completely. You may also need to administer antibiotics at home for few days after surgery. Give all prescribed medications at their proper dosage and time to enhance recovery time for your dog.
"
"While your dog is recovering, avoid using products which may irritate its nasal passages, including scented floor products and air fresheners.

"
"Fibrosarcomas arise from the connective tissue around the bones in the nose.
"
"Osteosarcomas are tumors that originate in the bones that make up the nose. It is more common to see osteosarcoma of the bones of the limbs. 
"
"Squamous Cell Carcinoma is a cancer of the nasal planum, the hairless tip of a dog’s nose. This cancer is rare in dogs, and can be detected early because it is visible on the nose surface. When these cancers occur, they are most often seen in males and in Labrador Retrievers.
"
"Transmissible Venereal Tumor (TVT) is a tumor that can be spread from dog to dog and tends to be seen on the genitalia of dogs from warmer regions like the southern United States. Occasionally, this tumor will grow on the nose and produce a red mass that tends to crumble off the nose. It is more common in dogs that have not been neutered.
"
"Nasal tumors often occur within the nasal passages and may go undetected until they are advanced. Many of the early symptoms of nasal tumors may appear similar to an upper respiratory tract infection or allergies and may be treated with antibiotics, antihistamines, or steroids. 
"
"Symptoms may initially respond to such treatments, but as the disease progresses, remission of clinical signs with those treatments is no longer possible. Some signs that may be noted in dogs with nasal tumors include: 
"
"Sneezing or reverse sneezing
"
"Coughing
"
"Bad breath, which occurs if tumors protrude into the mouth
"
"Nasal discharge, often appearing like pus (and may be streaked with blood). Nasal discharge may be noted from one or both nostrils
"
"Nose bleeds
"
"Noisy breathing and sudden snoring
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Weight loss
"
"Lethargy
"
"Swelling around the nose, bulging eyes, or other facial deformities
"
"If nasal tumors spread to the brain, a dog may show neurological signs of disease, such as:
"
"Changes in behavior
"
"Confusion
"
"Weakness
"
"Sudden blindness
"
"Seizures   
"
"Nasal cancers have many causes, including both genetic and environmental factors.  Any dog can develop a nasal tumor, but they tend to occur more often in medium-to-large breeds, and in older dogs with long noses.
"
"Dogs living in urban areas are more likely to develop nasal tumors, possibly due to pollutants within the nasal passages. Dogs exposed to cigarette smoke may also be at higher risk to develop nasal tumors.

"Imaging tests such as x-rays, CT scans, and MRIs are usually required to diagnose nasal tumors. X-rays may be used initially to screen for evidence of a nasal tumor, but more advanced imaging with CT scans and MRIs is needed to determine how much the tumor has advanced (called staging) and to develop a treatment plan. CT scans often provide the best picture to gauge the cancer’s spread. 
"
"Understanding what caused the tumor is important as well, which means collecting and examining cells from the tumor. 
"
"Fortunately, these kinds of tumors do not usually spread, but when planning treatment, veterinarians must ensure that nasal tumors haven’t metastasized. Lymph nodes will be biopsied to look for evidence of cancerous cells. Bloodwork, chest x-rays, and possibly abdominal ultrasound will also be needed to look for spread of the cancer. 
"
"Once nasal tumors are identified in dogs, radiation therapy is the treatment of choice. Although a cure is unlikely, it can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. A combination of surgery and radiation therapy may be recommended to improve the response to treatment and increase the chances of a cancer remission. 
"
"The type of radiation therapy may be determined on how close the tumor is to the brain and eyes. This is because radiation therapy can damage healthy tissue.
"
"If it appears the tumor invaded a bony structure—the cribriform plate—near the brain, a treatment called stereotactic radiation may be recommended. This method divides the overall radiation into smaller doses. 
"
"In some cases of nasal tumors in dogs, an anti-cancer pill called Palladia may also be recommended, in addition to radiation therapy, to help shrink the tumor. 
"
"Nasal tumors in dogs are rarely cured, but with radiation therapy, quality of life can be greatly improved and a clinical response is often noted within 2-3 weeks of treatment. Dogs treated with radiation therapy often have a median survival time of 12-18 months, compared to a median survival time of 2-6 months if left untreated. 
"
"In addition to treating the tumor itself, medications to manage the symptoms may also be used.  Antibiotics, antihistamines, and/or steroids may help initially with nasal discharge. As the disease progresses, appetite stimulants may be needed to help encourage dogs to eat.

"Nasal polyps are noncancerous growths in the nose caused by chronic inflammation in the sinuses, known as rhinitis. These growths are sometimes visible and look like pink protruding tissue in the nostril. However, in most cases these growths, which cause chronic sneezing and nasal drainage, are located deep within the nose and cannot be seen.
"
"A nasal polyp is a type of noncancerous tumor. The word tumor simply refers to an abnormal growth of tissue, which can be either benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Nasal polyps are a benign tumor type. They do not spread to other parts of the body or aggressively invade nearby tissues. While polyps are abnormal growths that shouldn’t be present, they are generally not considered dangerous on their own.
"
"However, there is a possibility that polyps can turn into cancer over many years, so it is recommended to have them removed if possible. Nasal polyps are not considered a medical emergency.
"
"Nasal polyps in dogs are primarily caused by chronic inflammation in the nose. This chronic inflammation can arise from a variety of factors, including the presence of an inhaled foreign body (such as weed seeds) or chronic infections.
"
"Additionally, environmental irritants like cigarette smoke have been linked to an increased risk of nasal tumors in dogs. Nasal polyps are much more common in cats than in dogs, where they are relatively rare.
"
"Some studies indicate that nasal polyps are more likely to occur in dolichocephalic and mesocephalic breeds such as Greyhounds, Collies, Setters, and Dachshunds, which are characterized by long and slender noses. These particular breeds have elongated nasal passages, making them more susceptible to inflammation within the sinuses and nose caused by inhaled seeds, bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Labrador Retrievers may also have a potential breed predisposition to nasal polyps.
"
"Veterinarians typically diagnose nasal polyps by visualizing the polyp. In some cases, the polyps may be visible just inside the nostril and look like pink, shiny bits of tissue. However, it is uncommon for the polyps to be easily visible in this way. In such cases, sedation may be required to allow the veterinarian to examine the nose more thoroughly. Most of the time, the polyps are located deeper in the nasal passages and can only be seen with a specialized tool. The rhinoscope is a long, thin instrument with a tiny camera on the end, enabling the veterinarian to visualize the polyps and make a definitive diagnosis.
"
"The recommended treatment for nasal polyps in dogs is surgical removal, if feasible. Often this is performed with endoscopy. After the polyp is removed, it is recommended to send it for biopsy to confirm that it is just a benign polyp and not cancerous. It is crucial to ensure that the stalk of the polyp is removed during the surgery; otherwise, it may grow back. In some cases, extracting the stalk can be challenging.
"
"In cases where surgery is not an option, whether because of the location of the polyp; safety concerns due to the age of the dog, concurrent disease, and anesthesia use; or financial reasons, medical treatment options—though not as effective as surgery—may be considered as alternatives. These include the use of steroids (prednisone) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (piroxicam) in combination with radiation therapy or antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections.
"
"After surgery, it’s normal for dogs to experience bloody drainage for a week or two. To prevent your dog from rubbing or pawing at their nose, they should wear a recovery cone. Be sure to keep the cone on at all times when your dog is unsupervised. During the recovery period, closely monitor your dog and contact your veterinarian immediately if they show signs of not eating, lethargy, depression, or excessive bleeding.
"
"Dogs can live with nasal polyps even if surgery is not feasible. While chronic sneezing may become a part of your dog’s life, it is important to monitor for secondary infections. The polyp may serve as a site of bacterial growth, leading to symptoms such as green-yellow nasal drainage, depression, or poor appetite. If you notice any of these changes, talk to your veterinarian about medical treatment and supportive care.
"
"The prognosis for a dog with a nasal polyp varies dramatically, depending on the size and location of the polyp. A large polyp obstructing the nasopharynx can lead to breathing difficulties and a shorter survival time, while a small polyp closer to the nostril may have minimal to no impact on a dog’s lifespan. In cases where a large polyp obstructs the airway and significantly affects a dog’s quality of life, euthanasia may be considered.
"
"The cost of removing a nasal polyp in a dog can vary depending on factors such as the location of the polyp and the extent of the surgery required. If the polyp can be accessed externally or through a scope, the cost may be lower. However, if extensive facial surgery or a CT scan is needed, the cost can increase. On average, the cost of polyp removal in dogs can range from $600 to $5,000.

"The term “nasal dermatoses” describes skin issues that can affect both the hairy part of a dog’s muzzle (nasal bridge) and/or the hairless part of the nose with the nostrils (nasal planum). 
"
"
Most conditions affect the junction between the two—an area called the mucocutaneous junction. 
"
"Signs of a possible nasal dermatosis in a dog include: 
"
"Hypopigmentation (a loss of pigment) of the nasal planum
"
"Hyperpigmentation (excess pigment) of the nasal planum 
"
"Ulceration (sores) 
"
"Crusting 
"
"Swelling 
"
"Redness 
"
"Scabbing 
"
"Bumps 
"
"Oozing lesions 
"
"Most of the diseases that cause nasal dermatoses in dogs have very similar symptoms. This makes it hard to diagnose this condition just by looking at it. 
"
"The four most common causes of nasal dermatoses in dogs include: 
"
"Bacterial infection (pyoderma/mucocutaneous pyoderma)
"
"Demodicosis (Demodex mites in the skin) 
"
"Dermatophytosis (ringworm) 
"
"Autoimmune disorders
"
"Pyoderma is a skin infection, most commonly caused by bacteria. It is usually superficial, affecting only the upper layers of skin and hair follicles. Bacterial pyoderma around the nose can also cause hypopigmentation (loss of pigment), crusting, oozing, and ulceration (sores). 
"
"
Bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are common causes of pyoderma in dogs. Malassezia yeast, which grows naturally on the skin but can grow too fast in cases of infection, is often found on affected skin along with the bacteria. 
"
"Demodicosis is a condition caused by the microscopic Demodex mite. It is also known as demodectic mange. 
"
"
These mites normally live on the dog’s skin, but they can reproduce quickly and cause skin lesions in young dogs or dogs with weakened immune systems. You may see lesions around the nostrils (hairless nasal planum).
"
"Dermatophytosis is the clinical name for ringworm. Ringworm is not caused by a worm or parasite, but by a fungus (most often Microsporum canis). 
"
"Because ringworm lesions are often not ring-shaped and can look like many other types of skin conditions, they can be easy to miss. Dermatophytosis is most common in young animals or animals with a weakened immune system. However, it can also affect healthy adult animals. 
"
"If infection and mites are ruled out, it may be time to consider autoimmune disease. Diagnosing an autoimmune disease in your dog will usually require taking a small sample of skin (biopsy). 
"
"
Autoimmune conditions such as pemphigus, lupus erythematous, uveodermatologic syndrome, and cancers like cutaneous lymphoma, can look identical to a skin infection, Demodex mites, or ringworm. 
 
"
"A vet can identify nasal dermatoses by doing a physical exam, but tests for the following underlying conditions are necessary to figure out what’s causing the condition.
"
"
Pyoderma in dogs is diagnosed through a procedure called skin cytology. During this test, the vet will take a sample of inflamed, crusted skin and examine it under a microscope. 
In some cases, a biopsy and/or culture of the skin may also be recommended. 
"
"
Demodex mites are diagnosed with a skin scraping, although it can be hard to find them because they live deep in the hair follicles. 
"
"
A skin scraping can be done in your vet’s office. The test consists of massaging a small area of your dog’s skin to squeeze any Demodex mites out of the hair follicles. A scalpel blade is then used to gently scrape a sample away from the top layer of skin. This sample is then examined under a microscope. 
"
"While a skin scraping may cause some rawness and mild bleeding, it is well-tolerated and not invasive.  
"
"Diagnosing dermatophytosis can be tricky because it often requires a fungal culture, which can take weeks to return a result. It may also be diagnosed by examining a sample of affected skin or hair under a microscope. 
"
"
The fungal organism can sometimes be seen on skin and hair samples, but a fungal culture or other specialized testing (like a fungal PCR test, which confirms the presence of ringworm DNA) may be necessary to rule out dermatophytosis. 
"
"
In some cases, a Wood’s lamp, which is a special lamp used to examine skin and eye lesions, will cause affected hairs to fluoresce (glow bright yellow) in the dark. 
"
"
While a positive Wood’s lamp test does confirm a ringworm diagnosis, a negative Wood’s lamp test does not rule out ringworm, as only a fraction of ringworm infections will actually glow.
 
"
"The treatment for nasal dermatoses depends on the underlying cause. 
"
"A simple topical antifungal or antibiotic may be recommended for mild cases of pyoderma, while an autoimmune disease will likely require long-term oral medication. Topicals such as antifungal wipes, and sprays may also be recommended.
"
"Flea and tick preventatives in the isooxazoline class (such as Bravecto, Credelio, Nexgard, and Simparica Trio) will kill the mites that cause demodicosis, although this would be considered off-label use. 
"
"Once your veterinarian has determined the underlying cause of the dermatosis, they will be able to give more treatment information. 
 
"
"Recovery and management of nasal dermatoses in dogs also depend on the underlying cause of the skin issue. 
"
"
Pyoderma and dermatophytosis (ringworm) can usually be fully cured with the correct treatment. 
"
"
Skin mites can be treated and prevented with certain types of flea and tick preventatives, although dogs with skin mites may also have coexisting skin infections that need treatment. 
"
"
Treating autoimmune diseases may be a bit more complicated. Depending on the type, it may require more than one medication and long-term treatment.
 
"
"Scabs on a dog’s nose are an indication of skin inflammation and irritation. Scabbing may be caused by several diseases, such as bacterial pyoderma (skin infection), demodicosis (mange caused by the Demodex mite), dermatophytosis (ringworm), trauma, and autoimmune disease.
"
"Bumps on the muzzle, like scabs on the nose, often indicate skin inflammation and irritation. Large bumps could be growths or hives, but small bumps often indicate skin infection and inflammation.
"
"If your dog’s nose is raw, inflamed, or irritated, it is important to have it checked by a veterinarian to determine the cause. Once the cause is determined, the best treatment can be discussed. In the meantime, it may be helpful to make sure that your dog’s nose stays clean and dry until it can be evaluated by a veterinarian. 
"
"While a small amount of Vaseline now and then is unlikely to be a problem, petroleum jelly (the main ingredient in Vaseline) can cause stomach upset, vomiting, and diarrhea in larger amounts. It also may be minimally effective because dogs tend to just lick it off. 
"
"
Some products are specifically formulated as paw and nose balms, but you should always talk to your veterinarian first in case your dog’s snout needs more treatment.

"The esophagus is the tubular organ that runs from the throat to the stomach; an esophageal stricture is an abnormal narrowing of the inner open space of the esophagus. It can affect dogs at any age, and there is no apparent genetic factor involved.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to rule out many of the possible diseases or conditions that might cause these symptoms. For example, if your dog has just been weaned, an abnormality called vascular ring anomaly may be the problem. In order to arrive at a definite diagnosis, your doctor may conduct a barium-contrast X-ray, which uses a radiopaque fluid in the esophageal passage, so that the passage of the liquid shows on the X-ray image, revealing abnormalities in the passage. An X-ray may reveal a foreign body caught in the esophagus. An insertable visual diagnostic tool called an endoscope can also be useful for visually examining the esophagus in closer detail. Your doctor will also be looking for tumors and masses.
"
"
"
"Your dog may be kept in the hospital initially. Once hydration needs are addressed and the affected portion of the esophagus is dilated, you may be able to take your dog home. If your dog has aspiration pneumonia and/or inflammation of the esophagus, it may need to remain under medical supervision longer. Intravenous fluids may be needed for correcting hydration status and medications may be given by injection following dilation procedures to facilitate healing. Oxygen may be needed for patients with severe aspiration pneumonia.
"
"Also, patients that have severe inflammation of the esophagus, and those that have had dilation procedures will not be able to take food through the mouth. A temporary feeding tube may be placed at the time of esophageal dilation as a means of providing continual nutritional support. When you do restart feeding your dog by mouth you will need to give bland, liquid foods that are easily digestible. Your veterinarian will advise you on the most appropriate foods that will help your pet through the recovery process.
"
"A barium contrast X-ray, a method which uses a radiopaque liquid in order to trace a passageway and to define abnormalities within, or endoscopy, using an insertable tubular instrument for visually examining the interior of the esophagus, will need to be repeated every two to four weeks until clinical signs have been resolved, and adequate esophageal lumen size (the inner space of the esophagus) has been achieved.
"
"A life-threatening complication of esophageal stricture dilation, called esophageal tear or perforation, usually occurs at the time of dilation. This complication has been observed after several days to weeks have passed, so you will need to observe your dog for signs of this. Also, remain observant for symptoms of aspiration pneumonia due to food, liquid, or objects being pulled into the lungs, because the risk remains high. Generally, the longer the stricture, the more guarded the prognosis. With esophageal strictures due to scarring, the prognosis is generally fair to guarded. Many strictures will recur despite repeated esophageal dilation; improvement without cure is a more realistic goal.

"A dog’s spine is composed of multiple bones with disks located in between adjacent bones called vertebrae. Seven cervical vertebrae are located in the neck (C1-C7), 13 thoracic vertebrae are present from the shoulder to the end of the ribs (T1-T13), seven lumbar vertebrae are present in the area starting from the end of the ribs to the pelvis (L1-L7), with the remaining vertebrae called sacral and coccygeal (tail) vertebrae.
"
"Cauda equina syndrome involves the narrowing of the vertebral canal, resulting in compression of spinal nerve roots in the lumber and sacrum regions. Pressure to or damage of the nerves within the spinal canal in the junction area between the lumbar and sacral vertebrae (also called the cauda equine) due to narrowing of spinal canal can lead to this condition, also known as the cauda equina syndrome.
"
"This syndrome is quite common in dogs. It can be congenital (present at birth) in small to medium-sized dogs, or an acquired condition (develops later in life), which is quite common in German shepherds, boxers, and rottweilers.
"
"As stated earlier, cauda equina syndrome can either be a congenital or acquired condition, brought on by the instability of the lumbosacral junction or protrusion of disk between adjacent vertebrae.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are usually within normal range, unless some other concurrent disease is also present. Radiographic studies usually reveal valuable information for diagnosis. But for definitive diagnosis, your pet’s veterinarian will typically conduct Computed Tomography (CT-Scan) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) testing.
"
" 
"
"Dogs with urination problems are hospitalized for initial treatment (e.g., catheterization of bladder) until the patient regains control bladder function. Decompressing surgery is a treatment of choice and is often conducted to relieve the pressure of the nerve roots. If no treatment is conducted, the symptoms become severe due to progressive nature of this disease.
"
"Even after surgery, however, some neurologic deficit may remain. Movements are restricted for at least four weeks after surgery. If surgery is not conducted, confinement and restricted leash walk is recommend along with pain control medications.
"
"Avoid exercising your dog strenuously (jumping, running, etc.), as it may increase excessive pressure on the spine and cause symptoms to recur. Watch your dog for pain, lameness, urination and/or fecal elimination problems and notify your veterinarian immediately if you should notice any such untoward symptoms. Some diet modifications may also be recommended by your dog’s veterinarian to avoid obesity, which might also aggravate the condition.
"
"Conform well to guidelines given by your dog’s veterinarian, especially directions regarding exercise, rest, and the diet of your dog.

"Chronic hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy, or pyloric stenosis, or, is the narrowing of the pyloric canal due to an overgrowth of muscles of the region. This region of the stomach connects with the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum. The exact cause of the disease is still unknown, but it has been found to be either congenital (existing at birth) in nature or acquired later in life.
"
"Cases of congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is found to be common in the boxer, Boston terrier, and bulldog. The acquired disease, on the othe hand, is more common in the Lhasa apso, shih tzu, Pekingese, and poodle. Males are also more predisposed to this disease than females.
"
"The severity of symptoms directly correlates to the extent of the pyloric canal's narrowing; these include chronic, intermittent vomiting (often several hours after eating), loss of appetite, and weight loss. Vomiting may contain undigested or partially digested food, and does not settle with the administration of drugs.
"
"The exact cause for chronic hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy is still unknown, though it is believed to be either congenital (existing at birth) or acquired later in life. Risk factors that may play a role in influencing the disease process include:
"
"Your dog's veterinarian will take a detailed history from you and perform a complete physical examination and laboratory tests on the animal. The results of routine laboratory tests, including complete blood profile, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, may be variable depending upon the underlying cause. In dogs with severe ulceration, for example, anemia may be present. X-rays, meanwhile, may reveal a distended stomach due to stenosis of the pyloric canal. For more detailed results, your veterinarian may perform a gastrointestinal barium contrast study, in which barium sulfate is given orally to help highlight the location and extent of the narrowing on X-rays.
"
"Another technique called fluoroscopy is sometimes employed. This imaging technique obtains real-time moving images of internal structures of the dog on camera with the use of a fluoroscope. The veterinarian may also employ endoscopy for detailed evaulation, in which he or she will look directly into the stomach and duodenum using an endoscope, a rigid or flexible tube that is inserted into the stomach and duodenum to visually inspect and take pictures of the region. Abdominal ultrasonography may also help in identifying the narrowing of the pyloric canal.
"
"
"
"Treatment depends upon the severity of the problem. After reaching a diagnosis, your veterinarian will decide the treatment, including surgery if required. Surgery is most commonly employed to correct the pyloric canal narrowing. Fluid therapy, meanwhile, is used to stabilize a dehydrated animal due to chronic vomiting.
"
"Proper nutrition (highly digestible, low fat diet) and activity restrictions will be instilled by the veterinarian, especially when the dog has undergone surgery. If recurrence of the defect should occur, a more aggressive surgical intervention will be required.
"
"Overall prognosis after surgery is excellent and most animals respond well. However, in the case of neoplasia, prognosis is not good.

"The trachea, or wind pipe, divides into two main bronchi, which further divide several more times into smaller bronchioles, forming the bronchial tree that feeds air into the lungs.
"
"In bronchiectasis, bronchi are irreversibly dilated due to destruction of elastic and muscular components of airway walls, with or without accompanying accumulation of lung secretions. Dilatation and accumulation of secretions perpetuates lung damage, invite infections to settle, and compromise the lung functions in patient. American cocker spaniels, West Highland white terriers, miniature poodles, Siberian huskies, and English springer spaniels are predisposed to this condition. Bronchiectasis can occur at any age but commonly seen middle-aged or older dogs which chronic lung disease.
"
"There are variable causes which may lead to bronchial inflammation in your dog. Therefore, a detailed history and a complete physical examination are essential for diagnosis. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, the onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Standard laboratory testing will include complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profiling, and urinalysis. Blood gas analysis will reveal information about the functional aspects of the lungs.
"
"These tests will be helpful in looking for infections or other changes related to the underlying disease. Your veterinarian will also take x-ray images of the chest, respiratory tract, and bronchial tubes, which may or may not show abnormalities in the architecture of the lungs, including dilatation of the bronchi.
"
"It is hoped that x-rays will reveal characteristic abnormalities in the bronchi that are related to this disease, but that is not always the case. Other changes in the lungs pertaining to chronic infections typically can be visualized using x-rays. Long term inflammation will leave evidence that can be visually examined. More sensitive testing, like computed tomography (CT) scanning, can be used for some patients, and this test may reveal more detailed information about structural changes within lungs. Your  veterinarian will also take samples of tissue and fluid from the bronchi for laboratory evaluation.
"

"
"
"In case of severe disease, your dog may need to be hospitalized for a few days. Emergency treatment, including fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, and removal of viscid fluid from lungs will be conducted to overcome the crisis. Antibiotics are often used to eradicate the infectious organism, and physiotherapy can be used to enhance the clearance of secretions from lungs. Your veterinarian will recommend minimizing any exposure to irritants such as dust, smoke, aerosol compounds, and air fresheners, which can further complicate the disease. Anti-inflammatory medications may help to reduce your dog's symptoms, making breathing easier. In severe cases, surgical removal of the affected lung lobe may be required.
"
"If disease is affecting a small area of the lungs, the affected lung lobe will be removed in order to effectively resolve the underlying disease. Prognosis is excellent for animals that are treated early, before significant inflammation or permanent scarring has taken place.
"
"Even in patients with resolution of the underlying disease or removal of the affected lobe, secondary infections are common. This is due to the diffuse nature of this disease, which often leads to complications. Or, some patients may take longer to completely recover due to the chronic nature of problem, the age or previous health condition of the dog, or because another underlying disease was not cured.
"
"You will need to visit your veterinarian at regular intervals so that your dog's progress can be followed, and so therapy and medication changes can be made appropriately, depending on your dog's ongoing status. Follow-up care is of paramount importance in improving your dog's prognosis.
"
"Your dog may improve better with some extra care and attention during the recovery period. Extra patience will be required, as you assist your dog in its daily needs, and keep it protected from undue stress. A calm and quite space, away from main entry ways, and protected from active children and pets, will help your dog to rest and heal. Pay strict attention to the medication guidelines and scheduling of doses in order to prevent further complications.
"
"Do not use anything in the home that will place unneeded stress on your dog's bronchial airways. Fireplaces, air fresheners, cleaning products and chemicals are just some of the things that can irritate your dog's respiratory tract. A place set aside where your dog can be taken when you are using any of these products is the best measure for protecting your dog from recurring attacks on its bronchial tubes.
"
"If you see a return of any of the symptoms described above, immediately call your veterinarian or take your dog to a veterinary hospital. Bronchiectasis makes the bronchia more vulnerable, so it is not uncommon for a recurrence of emergency crisis to occur in these cases.
"
"The prognosis is highly variable depending on the nature of the disease, the areas of the lungs being affected, the diffuse or focal nature of the disease, and the presence or absence of concurrent infections in the body. If treated properly, these patients can live well for number of years.

"Narcolepsy is a rare cause of sudden collapse or fainting in dogs. It can be scary to witness, but is usually not life threatening. Certain medications and lifestyle changes can be used to lessen the severity of the disease, but management is lifelong as narcolepsy is not curable.
"
"Signs of narcolepsy include:
"
"Sudden fainting/paralysis and loss of consciousness, usually during activity or excitement
"
"Muscle tone and reflex loss (cataplexy)
"
"Rapid eye movements (REM)
"
"Episodes usually only last a few seconds, but some dogs can take a few minutes to recover. Many dogs can be brought out of the event if you try to wake them up, as if they had been sleeping. If your dog is not rousable and the event is lasting longer than a few minutes, contact your nearest emergency veterinarian to make sure nothing else is going on. Even if your dog wakes quickly and easily, if you have not established a diagnosis or plan with your primary veterinarian, it is worth contacting them after an event to ensure no further steps need to be taken.
"
"Narcolepsy is most commonly an inherited disorder, which is why it is usually first seen and diagnosed in young dogs. A recessive gene linked to narcolepsy has been found in Doberman Pinschers, Labrador Retrievers, and Dachshunds. But any breed can be prone to the condition. Multiple gene mutations that cause similar clinical signs have also been determined.
"
"There have also been rare cases where a severe inflammatory event (meningitis, pneumonia, etc.) has led to narcolepsy in dogs who were not genetically predisposed. This is called acquired narcolepsy and is likely due to a dysfunction of the immune system, though research around this is not well understood. 
"
"There are multiple causes of collapse in dogs, so a full exam and blood workup is important to rule out cardiac, muscle, or different neurologic dysfunctions in dogs showing signs of narcolepsy. Often the complete blood count, blood chemistry, urinalysis, and baseline imaging (x-rays and ultrasound) are all normal in these dogs. Most cases of narcolepsy are diagnosed by symptoms and ruling out other causes.
"
"Scheduling a visit with a neurologist for advanced diagnostics such as an MRI and cerebrospinal fluid analysis can help rule out physical changes in the brain. Though this will not apply to all cases, if the affected dog has narcolepsy due to a shortage of hypocretin (a neurotransmitter), this can be measured.
"
"The most important part of treatment is learning to recognize patterns that lead to episodes. Many narcoleptic pets have these events most often when they are excited or during high-exertion activities. If these situations can be identified and avoided, that may reduce how often there are episodes. Sharing videos with your vet may help isolate potential triggers.
"
"Some pets will have frequent enough events that additional therapy is needed. Tricyclic antidepressants like imipramine have been used with success in some patients to help calm them. In acquired epilepsy, steroids and other immune system modifying drugs may be beneficial.
"
"Unlike seizures, the narcoleptic episodes themselves are unlikely to cause harm in a safe environment. They are not painful, and most body functions remain normal.
"
"Complete remission (or cure) of narcolepsy is unusual, even with medications, but dogs can live relatively normal lives with this disease. Environmental management is very important for long-term success. Play and physical activity are necessary to maintaining good quality of life, but care must be taken in choosing locations so that your dog is unlikely to injure themselves if they have a narcoleptic event. Swimming, running, and hiking steep mountains are riskier activities for narcoleptic dogs.
"
"Keep in mind that other dogs may not understand your dog’s condition. Fear and reactive aggression can be seen from companions when a narcoleptic dog has this sudden, abnormal behavior and body language. Activities with other dogs should be watched closely, and large groups of dogs/dog parks should likely be avoided.
"
"Narcolepsy is a sudden loss of consciousness, usually during excitement or activity, when the dog will act as if asleep. Unconscious dogs can often be woken from these episodes. If you are concerned that your dog is showing these symptoms, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian immediately.
"
"Narcolepsy is a lifelong condition, and it cannot currently be cured. It can, however, be managed in a way that maintains a good quality of life for your dog and your family.

"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease in dogs that causes varying degrees of muscle weakness.
"
"MG interferes with your dog’s nerves and the way these nerves should communicate with muscles to provide normal body movements and normal muscle contractions.
"
"Nerves transmit signals to the muscles. However, with MG, they don’t make it to the muscle properly.
"
"The immune system makes antibodies that destroy and block the receptor (called acetylcholine receptors)  for the nerve signal. Because of this failure, nerves can’t do their job, which is to contact muscles for body movement.
"
"In addition to muscle weakness, this condition can also affect a dog’s mental state because it can be quite debilitating. If your dog is exhibiting any changes in their physical or mental condition, they should be seen by their veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"There are three forms of MG in dogs:
"
"If you believe your dog is experiencing any of the above symptoms, contact an emergency veterinarian immediately.
"
"As our pets age there are many clinical signs that we need to be on the lookout for to make sure they don’t need medical attention.  By keeping an eye out for subtle changes we can address issues early which give us the best chance to provide our pets with a healthy and happy life free of pain.  Underlying diseases that may affect your pet’s mobility include arthritis, injury, degenerative neurologic diseases, certain types of cancer, diabetic neuropathy in cats, and hearing loss.
"
"Arthritis is the most common cause of decreased mobility in both dogs and cats.  Technically called degenerative joint disease (DJD) it occurs when abnormal movements in the joints cause erosion of cartilage.  This will progress to bone rubbing on bone which itself is very painful and leads to inflammation.  The inflammatory process creates a vicious cycle resulting in chronic pain for your pet.  Factors such as obesity, overly active lifestyle, joint conformation and genetic factors can contribute to this process.
"
"The most obvious sign of joint disease is when a dog or cat starts limping, usually right after they have been resting or lying down. However, there are numerous other subtle signs that may indicate your pet is uncomfortable.  Perhaps your dog doesn’t charge up the stairs like he used to. Maybe your older pet seems to be “slowing down.”  Cats may start urinating or defecating out of the litter box because it is too painful for them to jump into it.  These are just a few examples. Bottom line: if you notice any changes in your pet’s behavior, talk with your veterinarian immediately.
"
"Early treatment for arthritis can be as simple as switching to a prescription diet or starting supplements.  The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil act as a strong anti-inflammatory for the joints.  There are several glucosamine and chondroitin supplements on the market that help repair cartilage damage.  I recommend looking for a glucosamine and chondroitin supplement that also contains avocado/soybean unsaponifiables, Boswellia and green-lipped muscle. For your pet’s safety, consult your veterinarian for guidance in selecting and dosing over the counter supplements. For more advanced disease you should speak with your veterinarian about starting pain medication, acupuncture or physical therapy.
"
"Traumatic injury resulting in a muscle strain or ligament tear can result in pain with decreased activity.  These types of injury usually present suddenly and resolve with pain medication and rest.  If it is something more involved like a cruciate ligament tear the pet will usually need surgical correction for full return to function and to avoid developing secondary arthritis.  Your veterinarian can help determine the extent of your pet’s injury.
"
"Neurologic conditions such as intervertebral disk disease, inflammatory conditions in the brain and spinal fluid or tumors of the spine can affect mobility in a variety of ways.  The most common clinical sign in these diseases is weakness or paralysis in one or multiple limbs.  You can also see neck or back pain, decreased appetite, lethargy and fever.  If you are concerned that your pet is experiencing these signs, please seek veterinary care immediately.
"
"Certain cancers of the bones and cartilage can cause limping and decreased mobility.  These cancers are very painful and readily diagnosed with x-rays.  Pets are so adept at hiding their pain from us that we often don’t see any clinical signs until they stop putting any weight on the affected limb or develop a pathologic fracture.  Again early detection is essential for managing and treating these conditions as well as helping keep your pet from experiencing chronic discomfort. 
"
"Cats and rarely dogs can develop neurologic disease secondary to diabetes.  This is usually seen as weakness in the hind limbs called a “plantigrade stance” where the pet’s hocks are dropped almost touching the ground.  If you notice this in your pet speak with your veterinarian about testing them for diabetes.  If caught early and insulin therapy is started, diabetic neuropathy can be reversible.
"
"Finally decreased hearing can result in your dog or cat not leaping off the sofa to greet you when you walk in the door.  Unfortunately there isn’t much we can do to test or treat for this, but it is good information to discuss with your veterinarian to make sure there isn’t something more serious going on.
"
"A dog or cat’s activity level and mobility can tell us a lot of important information about their overall health, especially as they age.  Any changes, either subtle or drastic, should be discussed with your veterinarian.  Treatment could be as simple as adding in a supplement or additional tests may be necessary to make sure your pet is healthy and pain free.

"Myasthenia gravis can be both inherited (genetic) or acquired. Acquired MG is more common than inherited MG in dogs.
"
"MG does not just occur in dogs and cats; it also can affect humans. The neuromuscular disease is caused by a deficiency in the acetylcholine receptors found on the surface of muscle cells.
"
"This deficiency causes the signals between nerves and muscles to be interrupted, leading to muscle weakness in different areas of the body. The muscle weakness then leads to extreme fatigue within the dog.  
"
"The following breeds are predisposed to inherit congenital MG, meaning they’re born with the condition:
"
"Jack Russell Terriers
"
"English Springer Spaniels
"
"Smooth Haired Fox Terriers
"
"Smooth Haired Miniature Dachshunds
"
"Dogs with inherited MG are born with fewer receptors and tend to be diagnosed when they are less than 1 year old.
"
"Acquired MG is more often seen in older dogs, including:
"
"Newfoundlands
"
"Great Danes
"
"Golden Retrievers
"
"Akitas
"
"Scottish Terriers
"
"Acquired MG can occur because of environmental, infectious, or hormonal influences.
"
"These influences affect the immune system negatively and cause antibodies to be produced against the receptors, thus preventing muscle movement.
"
"This immune response is typically seen in dogs with chest tumors (thymoma) and can be associated with hypothyroidism.
"
"If your dog is showing any changes in their physical or mental ability, they should be seen by their vet as soon as possible.
"
"It’s also a good idea to take a video of your dog’s behaviors to show your vet in case your pup can’t show the signs at their appointment, such as exercise-induced symptoms.
"
"Your vet will perform a complete physical exam and analyze your pup’s bloodwork, including thyroid hormone levels. A diagnosis of MG in dogs is made when your vet takes a blood sample to measure antibodies against acetylcholine receptors.
"
"Elevated blood levels can confirm an MG diagnosis and the results are also used to monitor your dog’s response to treatment. Since this blood test needs to be sent to a special laboratory, it may take a few days to a few weeks to get the results.
"
"If MG is suspected by your vet based on the pup’s clinical signs and/or the breed of dog, a Tensilon test can be ordered while waiting for the blood test results. For this test, your dog will get an IV injection.
"
"This test will diagnose a pup’s MG. When a dog is given this injection and they do have MG, you will see an immediate improvement of weakness and other symptoms. Unfortunately, this injection and relief of symptoms only lasts for a few minutes.
"
"Additionally, chest X-rays will be performed to check for megaesophagus, aspiration pneumonia, or cancer. Aspiration pneumonia occurs secondary to regurgitation and muscle weakness in the throat.
"
"MG in dogs cannot be cured, but it can be treated and successfully managed. Treatment will depend on the type of MG diagnosed in your dog and the symptoms associated with their type of MG.

"
"If your dog has been diagnosed with MG, the most common medication used for treatment is pyridostigmine bromide.
"
"This medication will improve your pup’s muscle function by increasing the amount of time acetylcholine stays in the receptors on the muscle cells to coordinate movement.
"
"Prednisone or other steroid medications can also be used because they help suppress the immune system, thus suppressing the response that is causing MG. If your dog is diagnosed with associated hypothyroidism, levothyroxine sodium will most likely be prescribed for the rest of their life to manage the condition.
"
"Dogs with megaesophagus need to be fed their meals in a very special manner. They must be fed in an elevated food bowl, off the ground or in a special “Bailey chair” to keep them upright.
"
"This chair helps to to avoid inhalation of their food, which could result in aspiration pneumonia. It is recommended that pups with this condition be fed small meals more frequently during the day instead of two large meals. Dogs with megaesophagus should also be kept standing upright on their hind legs or in the special chair for 20 to 30 minutes after eating.
"
"If the dog has a thymoma tumor, surgery may be an option to remove if they are healthy enough for the operation. 
"
"A diagnosis of MG is typically serious, and the prognosis varies depending on your dog’s clinical signs, the type of MG they have, and any underlying causes.
"
"If your dog’s MG is caught and treated early, remission can be reached after several months, but some dogs do need lifelong treatment.
"
"Dogs that have aspiration pneumonia have a less favorable prognosis, especially if they have breathing complications or chest tumors.
"
"There are no known ways to prevent myasthenia gravis in dogs at this time.
"
"Depending on the underlying cause of your dog’s MG, they can live many years with the correct medical management and monitoring. Dogs with chest tumors have a less favorable prognosis.  
"
"MG can be inherited or genetic. It can also be acquired and triggered by hypothyroidism or a tumor in the chest cavity such as a thymoma.

"There are over 10,000 species of mushrooms in the United States, but only about 100 are toxic. However, it can be very difficult to accurately identify mushrooms to determine which are safe and which are poisonous. Depending on the specific mushroom ingested, mushroom poisoning in dogs can cause vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, and seizures, as well as liver and kidney failure. 
"
"Because highly toxic mushrooms can be deadly to pets, any mushroom ingestion should be treated as a medical emergency. If your dog ingested any wild mushrooms, seek immediate veterinary care. 
"
"Clinical signs of mushroom poisoning in dogs may affect pets quickly (within 15-30 minutes after ingestion), but they can also be delayed up to 24 hours. It may take 2-3 days to see evidence of liver and kidney failure. 
"
"Common clinical signs of mushroom poisoning include:
"
"Drooling
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Abdominal pain
"
"Weakness/lethargy
"
"Abnormal heartbeat
"
"Trouble breathing
"
"Uncoordinated movements/stumbling
"
"Disorientation
"
"Increased drinking and urinating
"
"Yellow discoloration to gums and eyes
"
"Tremors/seizures
"
"There is no simple test to differentiate a poisonous mushroom from a non-poisonous one. Therefore, unless a specialist can quickly identify a mushroom as non-toxic, all mushroom ingestions by pets should be considered potentially toxic, and a veterinarian should see the pet immediately. Mushroom poisoning in dogs can be fatal, so do not wait until clinical signs are noted. 
"
"In the U.S., there are approximately 100 toxic species of mushrooms, but most fatal species are Amanita, Galerina, or Lepiota. Mushroom poisoning in dogs can occur any time throughout the year, but it’s most commonly reported in September and October, when many mushrooms grow.
"
"The mechanism of poisoning can vary depending on the species of mushroom, but the deadliest is the Amanita species, which is absorbed by the stomach when ingested. The toxins (amanitins) travel to the liver, where they can kill liver cells and cause liver failure. The amanitins are then excreted by the kidneys, which can result in subsequent kidney failure. The amount needed to make a dog sick varies depending on the mushroom species, but in the deadly Amanita species, a single mushroom may contain enough toxin to be lethal. 
"
"Other species of toxic mushrooms are often grouped based on the clinical reactions they cause. For example, a relatively large group of mushrooms can cause gastrointestinal issues such as vomiting and diarrhea, which can be severe and lead to significant dehydration and decreased heart rate. There are also mushrooms that cause neurologic and hallucinogenic effects when ingested, resulting in stumbling, tremors, and even seizures. And then there are poisonous mushrooms that primarily target the kidneys, causing illness through kidney failure. 
"
"It's important to remember that accurately identifying mushrooms can be very difficult and should not be attempted unless you are a mushroom specialist (mycologist). If your dog eats any wild mushrooms, take them to the veterinarian immediately. 
"
"Your veterinarian will start with a thorough history of any possible toxins your pet may have been exposed to. It’s always helpful to tell your vet if your pet was recently hiking, traveling, or out of your sight when they got sick, even if you did not see them eat a mushroom. If you know your pet ingested mushrooms, try to bring a sample of the mushroom to your vet for examination. It’s best to store the mushrooms in a damp paper towel or paper bag, because plastic bags can cause mushrooms to spoil faster. It may also be helpful to photograph the mushroom in nature—and be sure to get shots from all angles.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a physical examination to assess your pet for abdominal pain, assess their heart rate, check their neurologic status, and assess for dehydration. A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will all likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation.
"
"While there are laboratory tests to screen for mushroom toxins in blood, urine, and vomit, these tests are not readily available and cannot usually be completed quickly enough to be of clinical assistance.  They are also limited in that not every species of mushroom has a corresponding laboratory test. That means a complete history of any possible mushroom ingestion is crucial.   
"
"Decreasing the stomach’s mushroom absorption is the top priority, so identifying what mushroom your dog ate may actually have to wait. Even veterinarians are not mushroom experts, so once your pet is stable, your vet may need to research the mushroom based on your sample and photos. 
"
"If your pet ate mushrooms within the past two hours, your veterinarian may induce vomiting at the hospital as a means of decontamination. If your dog is already showing clinical signs, it may be too late to induce vomiting, as there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. The vet may also give your dog activated charcoal to bind any additional toxin in the stomach.   
"
"Paronychia, also known as a nail infection, is relatively common in dogs. This condition results from trauma or injury to the skin surrounding the nail, which allows bacteria or fungus to invade the tissue and cause an infection.
"
"Onychomycosis refers to a fungal nail infection. Generally, multiple nails are affected. Onychomycosis is characterized by yellow to brown discoloration of the affected nails and surrounding skin. In some cases, thick discharge may collect at the base of the nails.
"
"Fungal infections generally have a strong odor and the affected nails may become thick, flaky, and weak. Most fungal nail infections are caused by a yeast called Malassezia. Less commonly, ringworm may be the culprit.
"
"Bacterial infections are usually localized in one nail. The nail itself typically appears normal, but the surrounding skin may be red, swollen, and warm to the touch. Pus and blood may ooze from the nail bed.
"
"Nail infections should be evaluated promptly by your veterinarian, especially if the nail is broken and the quick (the part of the nail that contains blood vessels and nerves) is exposed.
"
"Nail bed infections are quite painful for dogs, and prescription pain medications may be helpful. Left untreated, nail infections can progress and cause severe damage to the skin and nail.
"
"Signs of nail infections in dogs include:
"
"Discolored nails
"
"Yellow or white discharge at the nail base
"
"Thick, flaky, or peeling nails
"
"Swelling or redness at the nail base
"
"A muscle tear is an injury to the muscle caused by a trauma to that area, either directly or indirectly. Tears can happen at three points, or areas, of the muscle:
"
"At the point of origin (a bony bump or nodule where the thick, fibrous bands of the tendon, located at the ends of the muscle, attach to the underlying bone). This is the anchor point of the muscle.
"
"In the tendon (the area of thick, fibrous bands that connect the meaty portion of the muscle to the bone or bones that it moves). Tendons act as a tether from the muscle to the anchor point.
"
"Within the muscle belly (the central section of a muscle that is filled with myofibers, which control relaxing and contracting). The muscle belly is responsible for the movements of the muscle; these movements include everything from blinking to running.
"
"A direct trauma can be caused by an incident like a broken leg, where the breaking of the bone moves, stretches, and can sever surrounding muscles and tendons. An indirect trauma is seen when the animal twists or overloads the muscle, causing it to stress to the point of tearing.
"
"Once the location of the tear is identified, it is time to determine what type of tear it is. There are two types of tears:
"
"Partial: This is a tear that only extends partway through the muscle. A partial tear means the muscle is still attached on either end but has lost its full strength and integrity.
"
"Complete: This is a tear that extends through the entire muscle. A full tear means the muscle has been completely detached from where it should be.
"
"While uncomfortable to downright painful, a muscle tear is not a medical emergency. If your pet has a muscle tear, please make an appointment with your regular veterinarian for an exam and workup. There is no need for a very expensive emergency visit for this injury.
"
"Things to look for as signs of a muscle tear include:
"
"Unfortunately, there is no specific antidote for mushroom poisoning in dogs. Treatment varies depending on the type and amount of mushroom ingested. Some dogs may be treated outpatient, with symptomatic care for vomiting and diarrhea. However, if the mushroom cannot be identified or is identified as highly toxic, your dog will need to be hospitalized and started on IV fluids for hydration and supportive care. Generally, therapy will be started to try to prevent signs from developing, even if the dog is not showing any immediate signs of illness.
"
"Medications will be given to treat the symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, as well as treatment for muscle twitching and seizures. Additional therapy may include liver-support medications.   
"
"Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are crucial for a successful outcome. Mushroom poisoning can be fatal for many reasons, from neurologic symptoms like seizures to liver and kidney failure. Overall, the prognosis is very good for dogs that are treated quickly. 
"
"Most dogs will remain hospitalized for 3-5 hours, but will need more bloodwork to monitor their liver and kidney values daily for 72 hours following the ingestion. If the liver and kidney values are normal at that time and the dog is neurologically okay, no long-term consequences are anticipated. However, dogs with elevated liver and kidney values may end up with chronic liver and kidney disease. Although many mushrooms are not fatal, some dogs may still die from mushroom poisoning despite receiving therapy. 
"
"Prevention is key when it comes to toxicities in dogs. Even though there are many non-toxic mushrooms, it’s safest to assume all mushrooms are toxic until proven otherwise.
"
"Check your backyard regularly and remove any mushrooms you find. When taking your dog on a walk or hike, keep them on a leash anywhere mushrooms may be growing. The best way to prevent mushroom poisoning in your furry friend is to prevent them from having access to mushrooms in the first place!

"Frequent licking of the affected paw
"
"Pain
"
"Limping
"
"If you notice any of these signs, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian.
"
"The most common cause of a nail bed infection is trauma or injury to the nail or the skin surrounding the nail. Running, jumping, and playing can cause damage to these areas and increase the risk for infection.
"
"Large-breed dogs are more commonly diagnosed with nail infections, simply because they tend to spend more time outdoors participating in activities that can injure their nails and expose them to dirt and bacteria.
"
"Bacteria and fungi flourish in moist environments, so dogs who chronically lick their paws—often because of an underlying environmental or food allergy—may develop nail infections.
"
"Overgrown nails that curl around and touch the paw pads can cause irritation and wounds that can also lead to infection.
"
"There are various ways to diagnose paronychia in dogs.
"
"First, your veterinarian will examine your dog’s leg and paw. If you are aware of any trauma or injury that has occurred to your dog’s nails, it is important to let the veterinarian know so they can correctly diagnose the problem.
"
"Your dog will also be observed while walking to identify any signs of lameness, such as limping or pain.
"
"Tests that may be used to diagnose a nail infection include:
"
"Cytology—Discharge from the nail bed is collected with a cotton swab and examined under a microscope to identify bacteria, fungi, and inflammatory cells. Alternatively, a piece of clear tape can be pressed onto the skin surrounding the nail to collect a sample for microscopic examination.
"
"Fungal or bacterial culture—A sample collected from the nail bed is sent to a laboratory to determine the type of bacteria or fungi causing the infection, and specific medications that will be effective.
"
"Wood’s lamp—If your veterinarian suspects ringworm, a Wood’s lamp (i.e., black light) can be used to illuminate the fur at the nail base. If ringworm is present, the fur will glow yellow or green.
"
"X-rays—Images of the paw and affected nail may be taken to determine if bone is involved or if the infection is limited to the skin and soft tissue.
"
"Biopsy—If the infection is severe, a small skin sample from the nail bed may be removed and submitted to the laboratory. This is especially helpful if the infection is not responding to treatment. The area is numbed with a local anesthetic to prevent pain.
"
"If you suspect your dog has a nail infection, don’t try to remove any part of the nail or apply any medications before consulting your veterinarian.
"
"If the nail is bleeding, you may apply pressure until the bleeding stops and loosely bandage the wound before going to the vet.
"
"Never apply a tight bandage for any length of time, as this can cut off circulation to your dog’s paw and lead to serious injury. 
"
"Treatment for a nail bed infection involves oral or topical medications and bandaging. Oral antifungal drugs or antibiotics may be prescribed, based on the source of infection.
"
"Pain medications may be given to reduce inflammation and discomfort while the infection clears up. Chlorhexidine wipes may also be sent home to cleanse the area.
"
"Your pup’s veterinary team may apply a bandage, which will stay in place for two to three days and until your dog is rechecked. During your dog’s follow-up the bandage will be changed or removed, depending on whether the infection is improving.
"
"Pain when the area is touched
"
"Limping
"
"Swelling of the muscle
"
"Bruising in the painful area
"
"Abnormal limb stance, such as the hock—the angled joint in the middle of a hind leg—resting on the ground
"
"Muscle tears are an internal injury and not always easily seen on the outside. If a tear is mild, symptoms may be difficult to detect. If your dog has any of the signs listed above, something is definitely wrong.
"
"If your dog seems to be favoring one leg and not using it as much as the others, run your hands over all parts of the limb. Swelling from a muscle tear will feel a bit firmer and warmer than other areas. Your dog may flinch when you touch this area.
"
"By watching and noting how your dog walks, and running your hands over the painful limb, you can begin to better understand where your dog is hurt. Relay this important information to your veterinarian.
"
"Our canine friends are very athletic and can get themselves injured in many ways. Commonly, these include:
"
"Engaging in heavy exercise with no warmup
"
"Jumping higher or longer than the dog can comfortably do, thus overloading the muscles
"
"Wrenching or tweaking the joints while jumping and playing
"
"Chronic stress, such as long-distance running on hard surfaces
"
"Any muscle can tear if it is stretched past its capacity, but the most common muscle tears are seen in the major muscles of the front and back legs.
"
"Your veterinarian has many diagnostic tools to help identify a torn muscle:
"
"Blood work can show elevations in enzymes (specifically creatine phosphokinase), supporting the diagnosis of a torn muscle.
"
"X-rays allow your veterinarian to see the soft tissue and bone within the injured area. Some tears can cause fragments of bone to pull away from the main bone. Other types of tears may cause bony calcifications where the tendon attaches. Occasionally, x-rays will show where there are areas of soft tissue swelling within the dog.
"
"Ultrasounds can reveal disruption of tendon fibers within the muscle where a tear is located.
"
"CT or MRI scans give the highest level of detail, with computerized 360-degree views of your dog’s structures. Your regular veterinarian may not have this specialized imaging equipment but can refer you to a specialty clinic that does.
"
"Supportive care for a partial muscle tear involves immediate rest, placing the dog on a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication, and applying a cold compress to help decrease swelling. Depending on which muscle is torn, a mild compression bandage can be placed to help alleviate swelling.
"
"For mild partial tears, your veterinarian may start a passive physical therapy program intended to prevent complications during healing. After a week or so of therapy, and once cleared by your veterinarian, your dog may engage in restricted and carefully controlled exercise, such as short leash walks (no rampages at the dog park, jumping, or running).
"
"Complete muscle tears need to be surgically corrected for your dog to regain full function of the muscle and of the portion of the body that the muscle moves. Surgery is usually performed a few days after the injury occurs to allow for the swelling and inflammation to go down. After surgery, the dog generally has a passive physical therapy routine, followed by at least a month of strictly controlled exercise to allow for proper healing and prevent further injury.
"
"With supportive care and rest, many partial tears can develop fibrous scar tissue and heal themselves. Complete tears will never heal back to normal on their own. They may cause further problems down the road if the severed end of the muscle develops scar tissue attaching to surrounding tissues, disrupting how the surrounding muscle functions. A complete tear will ideally be surgically fixed and allowed to heal for a period before returning to normal function.
"
"Which muscle, where it is located, and what type of tear occurred are the main determinants of how long it takes to recover. Tears involving tendons and ligaments require a much longer time frame, because they do not heal as fast as muscle due to lower blood flow in these areas. A mild tear may take as little as a few weeks to return to normal function, while a complete tear requiring surgery may take months.
"
"In both types of tears, restricted activity is key. After the initial period of rest to allow the swelling, pain, and inflammation to recede, carefully controlled activity (such as short leash walks or passive range-of-motion physical therapy) is important.

"“Scotty Cramp” is a hereditary neuromuscular disorder characterized by periodic cramps. It is seen in Scottish Terriers, especially those less than one year of age.
"
"Symptoms do not typically arise until the dog exercises or becomes overly excited. The episode(s) may continue for up to 30 minutes and include such signs as:
"
"Although it is inherited, some experts believe Scotty Cramp to be the result of a disorder in serotonin metabolism within the dog's central nervous system.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- the results of which are typically within normal ranges.
"
"For testing purposes, your veterinarian may also give the dog serotonin antagonists to induce symptoms associated with the disorder. If cramping starts within two hours (continuing up to eight hours after initial dosage), it is a good indicator of hereditary Scotty Cramp.
"
"
"
"Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available at this time. However, behavioral modification and/or environmental changes have been shown and are recommended to eliminate triggers which may cause the onset of symptoms.
"
"Overall prognosis is good in Scottish Terriers with mild forms of the disorder, while those with severe Scotty Cramp have a more dismal prognosis. Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for behavioral modifications and place your dog in a stress-free environment, away from other pets and active children.

"Before letting your dog go outdoors, cover the affected paw and ensure they are not able to dig in the dirt. It may be helpful for your dog to wear a padded boot when they go outdoors. Walking your dog on a leash for potty breaks can also help prevent them from causing further injury.
"
"Most nail bed infections resolve in seven to 10 days. If the nail is broken, it will take several weeks or months to regrow, but the swelling and inflammation should resolve by the time your dog’s oral medications are finished.
"
"To prevent nail bed infections, keep your dog’s nails trimmed so they aren’t touching the ground when they walk.
"
"If you are unsure how to safely trim your dog’s nails, ask your veterinarian to teach you.
"
"Additionally, make sure to treat any underlying allergies to prevent your dog from chewing and licking their paws, which increases infection risk.
"
"A few telltale signs that your dog may have nail fungus are yellow to brown discoloration of the nail, a strong odor, or thickened, flaky nails.
"
"Although we clean our wounds with hydrogen peroxide, it shouldn’t be used for the same purpose in dogs. Hydrogen peroxide can lead to more discomfort and irritate the affected nail bed.
"
"Safe and gentle alternatives, such as chlorhexidine, can be provided by your veterinarian to clean the area.

"Complete inactivity and immobilization of a muscle or group of muscles after an injury can lead to permanent contraction of those muscles. Permanent contraction is where the muscles are pulled tight and remain that way. A permanently contracted muscle can no longer function, and the limb becomes stiff and unable to move. Therefore, controlled exercise is extremely important.
"
"A few simple steps can help minimize the chance that your dog will get a muscle tear:
"
"Let your dog warm up before activity. A five-minute walk can help to get blood flowing and make the muscles more elastic before the dog does a high-energy or high-load activity.
"
"Make sure your dog is supervised when playing with other animals. Dogs can get wild and overstretch their muscles easily while having a blast in your yard or at a dog park.
"
"Avoid games or toys with an increased chance of causing a muscle tear or a chronic muscle injury. Games where the animal pivots or turns quickly, has sudden stops, or makes a large leap all come with increased risks for muscle injury. These games include fetch, dock diving, hunting, agility sports, and herding.
"
"A muscle tear is the complete or partial ripping of the fibers that make up a muscle’s structure, whereas a pulled muscle is an overstretching of the components.
"
"Yes, a pulled muscle is one where the muscle fibers within the muscle have been stretched beyond their capacity, but are not torn apart.
"
"Dogs with a pulled muscle will have symptoms similar to those observed with a torn muscle; however, the symptoms will be milder. Things to look for when a muscle is pulled are muscle spasms, weakness, cramping, and immobility, as well as pain, bruising, and swelling.

"The term ""myoclonus"" is used to denote a condition in which a portion of a muscle, entire muscle, or group of muscles contracts in a coarse, repetitive, involuntary, and rhythmic manner at rates up to 60 times per minute (sometimes even occurring during sleep).
"
"These abnormal contractions occur due to nervous dysfunction and most commonly affect groups of muscles involved in chewing and/or any of the skeletal muscles of the limbs. Myoclonus is also seen in cats, though it is rare.
"
"Involuntary, continuous, coarse, and rhythmic contractions of a muscle, portion of a muscle, or group of muscles is the most common sign to look out for. However, there are other symptoms your dog displays that are related to the underlying disease causing myoclonus.
"
"The most frequent cause of myoclonus in dogs is canine distemper, though it may be drug-induced or due to lead poisoning. Myoclonus is also congenital condition, one that is often seen in Labrador retrievers and Dalmatians.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including any illnesses it may have recently suffered from and symptoms it has displayed. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- the results of which may show abnormalities related to underlying cause, including inflammation of brain and spinal cord (encephalomyelitis). He or she may also take a sample of your dog's cerebrospinal fluid (a protective and nourishing fluid circulate around brain and spinal cord) or administer an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) on the animal.
"
"
"
"The course of treatment for myoclonus will depend on the underlying cause of the disorder. Dogs with inflammation of brain and spinal cord, for example, are given medication to reduce swelling. Unfortunately, dogs with severe and chronic myoclonus suffer immensely. Your veterinarian may recommend euthanasia in these cases.
"
"This problem usually continues indefinitely, although remission is possible. Dogs that display myoclonus after succumbing to the canine distemper virus have a poor prognosis.
"
"Watch for symptoms that may be associated to the treatment for brain and spinal cord inflammation, and call your veterinarian if they should worsen. The dog may require a new diet or movement restriction depending on the severity of the disease.

"The salivary glands consist of four sets of glands that make up the exocrine glands of the mouth in mammals. The parotid, submandibular, sublingual, and minor salivary glands make up this essential group that controls the production of saliva, which in turn breaks down starches into glucose for use by the body.
"
"The parotid salivary gland is located just underneath each ear in the dog.  When a dog is exposed to a person who is infected with a viral infection called the mumps, the dog may develop the same infection. This cross-over is very rare, but is known to occur occasionally. When a dog does acquire an infection, the parotid salivary glands will swell in response.
"
"Mumps is caused by a viral infection of the salivary gland located just below the ears in dogs.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, including whether your dog has come into contact with anyone know to be infected with a virus. Your veterinarian will examine your dog by palpation (touch) to determine the amount of enlargement and precisely where the swelling is located. Once the location has been determined to be in the parotid glands, your veterinarian will order a complete blood count and biochemical profile. This will be analyzed for other diseases that might be causing the salivary glands to swell. A blood sample will also be taken for a viral antibody test, which will show whether dog has been exposed to the mumps infection, or to other infections. An aspirate collected by a fine needle will also be drawn so that the fluid in the glands can be analyzed.
"
"
"
"No specific treatment is usually required.  If your dog has become dehydrated due to vomiting, diarrhea, or because it has been too weak to drink water, it may need to be given fluids, either under the skin (subcutaneously) or intravenously (IV). If your dog has a critically high fever, it might be given medication to help bring the fever down, but generally, moderate fevers are left alone and allowed to run their course.
"
"Your dog will recover from a mumps infection in five to ten days. During this time, follow your veterinarian’s advice and make sure that your dog drinks plenty of water and continues to eat. If your dog is having trouble eating and needs special food to entice it to eat, you may want to offer it special (healthy) foods that are easy to chew and keep down until the dog feels better. For example, soft foods or select people foods. Your veterinarian can advise you to what is appropriate.
"
"It is very important that you first ask your veterinarian before you give your pet any human medicines to help with the fever, as some medications can be toxic to your pet.
"
"Do not allow your dog to come into contact with people who are infected with the mumps virus.

"Your dog’s poop can tell you a lot about their health.
"
"Before you pick it up, always take a quick peek to make sure your dog’s poop looks normal. Mucus can be common in dog poop and usually looks like shiny slime, clear jelly, or snot surrounding the stool. If you see mucus in your dog’s stool, it’s important to find out what could be causing it.
"
"
"
"
"
"A little bit of mucus in a dog’s stool is not a reason to panic.
"
"However, excessive amounts of mucus in your dog’s poop may indicate a medical condition that needs veterinary attention. If you consistently see mucus in your dog’s stool, or you see a lot of mucus—even if it’s just in one instance—call your vet.
"
"However, if your dog is very young or very old or has a pre-existing condition, speak with your vet immediately if you notice any mucus in their stool.
"
"Additionally, mucus can occur with diarrhea and with blood. If your dog is having diarrhea with mucus or any blood in their stool, visit your vet right away.

"
"Anything that causes colitis or inflammatory/irritation to the colon can cause mucus production, which then causes mucus to appear in the stool.
"
"Here are some of the more common disorders that cause mucus in dog stool.
"
"Bacteria, viruses, and fungi can all infect the canine gastrointestinal (GI) system. This can include E.coli, salmonella, parvovirus, and pythiosis.  
"
"With GI infections, most dogs will also develop diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or other symptoms in addition to mucus in the stool. Supportive care and medications that address the infection will typically be needed.
"
"Whipworms, tapeworms, Giardia, and other intestinal parasites can cause mucus in a dog’s stool.
"
"A fecal exam can identify the type of parasite present, and an appropriate dewormer should take care of the issue.
"
"When a dog eats something unusual, it can disrupt their GI tract and cause mucus in their stool. Mild cases resolve with time.
"
"More severe cases may require medications to control vomiting and diarrhea, antibiotics, fluid therapy, nutritional support, and sometimes surgery to remove foreign material.
"
"An abrupt change in diet can lead to mucus in a dog’s stool. Returning to the original food and then slowly mixing increasing amounts of the new food into the old will usually resolve the problem.
"
"In some cases, a food allergy/intolerance may be to blame. You may need to switch to a therapeutic diet, like a veterinarian-prescribed hypoallergenic food.
"
"Stress is thought to be a major factor in flare-ups of irritable bowel syndrome.
"
"Treatment involves stress relief, dietary changes, and medications (sulfasalazine, for example) that lessen the severity of a dog’s symptoms.  
"
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can cause mucus in the stool, but it is usually accompanied by weight loss, vomiting, or diarrhea.
"
"Treatment with diet changes and sometimes immunosuppressive medications should reduce a dog’s symptoms.
"
"Cancer of the GI tract can cause mucus in the stool.
"
"Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or palliative therapy.
"
"When a dog’s stool contains a lot of blood and mucus (often described as looking like raspberry jam), AHDS—also known as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis—may be to blame.
"
"Treatment includes supportive care, anti-nausea drugs, fluid therapy, and antibiotics.
"
"It’s time for a vet appointment if your dog has abnormal amounts of mucus in their stool over an extended period, or if your dog has additional symptoms, such as:
"
"Poor appetite
"
"Weight loss
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Concurrent blood in the stool
"
"Pain
"
"In these cases, take your pup to the vet as there could be an underlying health issue at play.
"
"If your dog is pooping mucus, your veterinarian will take a complete health history and perform a physical exam.
"
"To determine the underlying cause, they may need to run a combination of the following tests:
"
"Fecal exam
"
"Blood work
"
"Urinalysis
"
"Abdominal X-rays and/or ultrasound
"
"Endoscopy
"
"Biopsy of the intestinal tract 
"
"Appropriate treatment will depend on the results of these tests and your dog’s eventual diagnosis.
"
"However, often a diet change or even a prescription diet are needed.
"
"Based on the underlying cause, anti-diarrheal medication, immunosuppressants, or antibiotics may be prescribed.
"
"Probiotics can be a good addition to treatment plans for mucus in stool.
"
"If your dog has just a little bit of excess mucus in their stool but is otherwise feeling fine (eating well, happy, active, no diarrhea), ask your vet about trying to treat at home before an office visit and diagnostic work-up.
"
"Sometimes switching to a highly digestible diet or adding additional fiber to a dog's diet can help.
"
"Boiled white meat chicken (no skin or bones), white rice, and a teaspoon to a tablespoon (depending on the size of the dog) of canned pumpkin is a good, homemade option that you can typically feed your dog for a few days.
"
"A small amount of mucus in the stool—in an otherwise healthy dog—does not require treatment with medications, but a probiotic supplement may help.
"
"Look for probiotic products designed specifically for dogs or ask your veterinarian for recommendations.
"
"Depending on the underlying cause, mucus in a dog’s poop may be a temporary problem that quickly resolves.
"
"However, in other cases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mucus in the poop could wax and wane with relapses of the underlying condition. This may be an indicator to talk with your vet. 
"
"Normal stool appearance can be tied to pet health. Monitoring your dog’s poop is a great way to make sure they’re on the right track. Watch for any mucus in the stool or any other abnormalities, such as blood or diarrhea.
"
"If you are unsure if something is normal, call your vet and remember that photos can be useful.

"Melanocytic tumors of the oral cavity arise from a local invasion of neoplastic melanocytic cells, or melanin-producing cells found in multiple sites throughout the body, including the mouth and skin. These tumors arise from the gingival surface and are aggressive in nature. They are usually raised, irregular, ulcerated, have a dead surface, and are highly invasive to bone.
"
"Melanocytic tumors are the most common oral malignant tumors in dogs, commonly affecting dogs over 10 years of age. Such tumors may cause death as these render animals unable to eat, lose weight, and metastasis to other body parts.
"
"The underlying cause for oral melanocytic tumors is currently unknown.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform various laboratory tests, including a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal -- as well as a physical examination, especially of the oral cavity.
"
"Your veterinarian will also take a small deep tissue sample from the mass in the oral cavity, including a part of bone to be sent to a veterinary pathologist for further evaluation. Such biopsy samples are usually helpful in making a definitive diagnosis. In addition, X-rays of the oral cavity, skull, and lungs will help in the evaluation of the extent and location of metastasis.
"
"
"
"After reaching a definitive diagnosis and careful evaluation, your dog’s veterinarian, in consultation with a veterinarian oncologist, will plan surgery to excise the tumor mass along with part of the bone involved. Your veterinary oncologist will also suggest chemotherapy in combination with radiation therapy to further enhance the treatment's effectiveness. Soft foods are recommended after surgery to prevent tumor ulceration and to ease out ingestion of food.
"
"Prognosis depends upon the stage, location, extent of metastasis, and extent of the tumor mass removed during surgery. Unfortunately, the overall prognosis in most dogs is not good and most die due to rapid loss of body weight, an inability to swallow correctly, and the spread of the tumor (to the lymph nodes in 80 percent of the cases). Treatment, therefore, is directed toward improving the animal's quality of life.
"
"After surgery, you should expect your dog to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication to help minimize your dog’s discomfort, which should be used with caution (one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication). Follow all your veterinarian's directions carefully and limit your dog's activity while it heals, setting aside a quiet place for it to rest away from household activity, children, and other pets.
"
"It is important to monitor your dog's food and water intake while it is recovering. Due to involvement of the oral cavity, these patients are not able to take feed for number of days. Your veterinarian will devise a diet plan, which will include highly palatable and nutritious foods. As affected dogs already have a tendency to lose weight, providing food to keep body weight within normal range is of utmost importance. 
"
"In addition, chemotherapy medications have the possible toxic side effects, so your veterinarian will need to closely monitor your dog's stability, changing dosage as necessary. He or she will also conduct routine X-rays of the skull and lungs, and ask you to bring the dog in for regular evaluation visits to check progress and for recurrence.

"Ameloblastoma, previously known as adamantinoma, is an uncommon neoplasm that affects the tooth structures in dogs. In most cases the mass is found to be benign in nature, but a rare, highly invasive malignant form is also recognized in some dogs. It may be present at any place within the dental arcade. As with many cancers, ameloblastoma mainly affects middle-aged or older dogs.
"
"Ameloblastoma is usually benign in nature and remains well localized. You may notice a firm and smooth mass covering the gingival space. The presence of a mass is usually enough to convince an owner to visit a veterinarian.
"
"The exact cause is still unknown.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination on your dog, with a detailed examination of the oral cavity, including the tumor mass. A complete blood profile will also be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. In most cases the laboratory test results are within normal ranges and no abnormality related to this neoplasm is noticed. X-ray images of the skull will be helpful in estimating the penetration of the neoplasm within the bone structures. A computed tomography (CT) scan will give more refined results and will help in planning the treatment for your dog. Often a deep tissue biopsy will be conducted so that a sample of deeply penetrated neoplasm tissue can be examined. In this way your veterinarian can determine if the neoplasm is benign or malignant in nature.
"
"
"
"As with most benign neoplasm, surgical excision remains the treatment of choice for ameloblastoma. After a determination has been made of the size, location, and extent of penetration, your veterinarian will schedule a surgery to remove the entire mass. During surgery some margins of normal tissue are also removed to ensure complete excision of neoplasm. Alternatively, in some patients only radiation therapy is sufficient to completely resolve the problem, while in other patients both surgical excision and radiation therapy may be needed for a complete cure.
"
"Most patients will regain normal health without any complications after surgical treatment. Follow your veterinarian’s guidelines after the initial care, including special diet recommendations, until your dog is fully recovered and has begun eating normally again. After treatment with surgery or radiation therapy, your veterinarian will schedule follow-up visits every three months for complete evaluation and progress checks. At each visit, your veterinarian will ensure that there is no re-growth of tumor.

"Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of metabolic disorders characterized by the accumulation of GAGs (glycosaminoglycans, or mucopolysaccharides) due to the impaired functions of lysosomal enzymes. It is the mucopolysaccharides which help in building bones, cartilage, skin, tendons, corneas, and the fluid responsible for lubricating joints.
"
"Plott hounds, Labrador retrievers, wire-haired dachunds, Huntaway (sheep) dogs, miniature pinschers, miniature schnauzers, Welsh corgis, mixed breeds, and German shepherds are predisposed to mucopolysaccharidoses.
"
"Symptoms and signs depend upon the type of enzyme deficiency, type of GAG stored, and the tissue in which storage occurs. Some of the more common ones include:
"
"Mucopolysaccharidoses is a genetic abnormality. However, inbreeding increases the risk, especially if the defective gene is present in the family.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). These tests may reveal valuable information for initial diagnosis, including the presence of characteristic granules within neutrophils and monocytes (types of white blood cells). Your pet’s veterinarian will also take a sample from other body sites and organs -- such as the liver, bone marrow, joints, and lymph nodes -- for further analysis.
"
"Definitive diagnosis, however, is typically made by measuring the lysosomal enzyme levels in blood or liver. Bone X-rays, meanwhile, will reveal decreased bone density and other bone- and joint-related abnormalities.
"
"
"
"If a bone marrow transplant is conducted at an early age, the dog may be able to live a “near normal” life. However, this treatment is expensive, life-threatening, and not very helpful at a mature age. Also, a healthy donor is required for bone marrow transplant.
"
"Enzyme replacement therapy is effective in dogs with mucopolysaccharidoses, but this, too, is an expensive recourse and has not been widely used in animals. Gene therapy, meanwhile, is thought to be an effective method of treatment, and is under evaluation for the treatment both in humans and animals.
"
"Overall prognosis in dogs that have undergone bone marrow transplants is usually good. However, as the dog gets older, it will suffer from various problem, including eating difficulties. Therefore, they will require softer and easily palatable foods. Dogs with mucopolysaccharidoses are also prone to infections and may require antibiotic therapy.
"
"Due to the genetic nature of this group of disorders, your veterinarian will recommend against breeding dogs with mucopolysaccharidoses.

"Carcinoma, a type of tissue cancer that is particularly virulent, can occur in any part of the body, including the mouth. This form of cancer has the capability of metastasizing quickly through the body, often with fatal results. Of the several types of cancerous oral growths that a dog can be affected by, a squamous cell carcinoma is the most common one. These tumors grow very rapidly and typically invade nearby bone and tissue. Unlike other carcinomas these tumors do not usually spread to other organs, but, like other carcinomas, they are mainly seen in older dogs, around ten years old. However, squamous cell tumors have been seen in dogs as young as three years old.
"
"No causes have been found.
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog and will take body fluid samples for laboratory analysis, including a complete blood count, biochemical profile and urinalysis to make sure your dog's internal organs are functioning normally. The physical examination will consist of your veterinarian performing an extensive examination of your dog's oral cavity, looking especially for loose teeth and a mass of tissue growth. A simple palpation (examination by touch) will indicate whether the lymph nodes under your dog's jaw and along its neck are enlarged, a confirmation of which would indicate that the body is fighting a diseased condition (as the lymph nodes produce white blood cells). If your dog has enlarged lymph nodes, your veterinarian will take a sample of fluid by aspiration needle to better understand the composition of the fluid. This test may tell your veterinarian if the growth in the mouth has spread to the lymph nodes. Your veterinarian will also order x-rays of your dog's chest and head to determine if the oral tumor has spread to bone and tissue near it, or to the lungs. Your veterinarian will also need to perform a biopsy of the growth in order to make a more precise diagnosis of the type of tumor it is.
"
"
"
"Treatment will depend on how large the growth in your dog's mouth is. If it is very small and has not spread to the bone near it or to other places, it might be removed by a technique that employs freezing (cryosurgery). If the tumor is larger, a more invasive surgery may be necessary to remove the growth and possibly part of the bone or jaw near it. Most dogs recover well even when part of the jaw has been removed. Your veterinarian may recommend radiation therapy after surgery to ensure that the cancer has been entirely eliminated. Radiation therapy after surgery has been found to help some dogs live longer.
"
"If your dog's tumor is too large to remove with surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy may be used to treat the growth. Radiation and chemotherapy can be used alone or together. Generally, dogs will fare better, and for a longer time when radiation and chemotherapy are used together. Some dogs are cured with radiation and chemotherapy, but this is rare. More often this therapy slows the growth so that the dog's life is extended.
"
"Another type of therapy that is sometimes used to treat oral squamous cell carcinomas is photodynamic therapy, which uses a photosensitive cancer killing agent that is activated by the wavelengths in a surgical laser beam. Photodynamic therapy will reduce the size of the tumor and help control growth, thereby reducing your dog's symptoms.
"
"Your dog will need to stay in hospital for several days after the surgery. Your veterinarian will monitor your dog's pain level and its ability to eat and drink on its own before releasing it to home care. After your dog goes home with you, its mouth may still be sore, especially if it has had part of its jaw removed. It will also have difficulty eating for some time after. Your veterinarian will help you to make a diet plan that includes food that is easy to chew until your dog has learned to compensate for the loss of jaw bone. You may even need to sit with your dog, feeding it small amounts of food by hand until it is able to eat on its own again. Your veterinarian will also give you medication to manage the pain. Make sure to closely follow all directions that you are given with the medication.
"
"Even when surgery is not the treatment of choice, radiation therapy may also make your dog's mouth sore, so you will need to feed soft food during this stage of therapy as well. It is common for dogs that have had radiation therapy to develop sores in the mouth and not want to eat because of irritation to the sores. If your dog does not eat or drink for several days, it will become very ill. In these cases, if your dog will not, or cannot accept supplemental liquid nourishment from you, it may need to be in the hospital so it can be given nutrition intravenously (IV). One of the more common side-effects of chemotherapy is nausea, which will also lessen your dog's appetite. Your veterinarian will give you medication to help minimize the nausea.
"
"Typical of carcinomas of any type, squamous cell carcinomas of the mouth will often recur. With surgery and radiation, some dogs can be comfortable for up to three years before a recurrence.

"The incidence of mothball poisoning in pets is quite low — 158 cases were reported to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) between 2002 and 2004. But that becomes irrelevant when it’s your pet who has become sick.
"
"According to the APCC, most of these cases involve a pet eating a mothball, but problems can also arise when they are exposed to the fumes that mothballs produce or when their skin comes in contact with them. If you have mothballs in your home, you need to know what makes them toxic and what to do if your pet comes into contact with them.
"
"First of all, mothballs are not all the same. They can contain two different active ingredients: naphthalene or paradichlorobenzene (p-dichlorobenzene). These two chemicals are also available as flakes, cakes, and crystals, in addition to mothballs. In whatever form, naphthalene is about twice as toxic as paradichlorobenzene, which means that a pet can eat approximately twice as much paradichlorobenzene before death occurs. Therefore, if you’re going to buy mothballs, look for ones made from paradichlorobenzene.
"
"The symptoms of naphthalene and paradichlorobenzene toxicity are different too. After being eaten, naphthalene first affects the gastrointestinal system, causing vomiting and poor appetite, but problems don’t stop there. Naphthalene also damages a pet’s red blood cells and can lead to anemia, brown colored mucous membranes, weakness, lethargy, and sometimes seizures. Cataracts and liver damage are possible as well. Naphthalene can also be absorbed through the skin and lungs, but the most severe problems develop after ingestion.
"
"Pets who eat paradichlorobenzene may also vomit, but then tend to have symptoms associated with dysfunction of the nervous system, including disorientation, tremors, difficulty walking, drooling, depression, and seizures. Cataracts and liver damage may develop too. In rare cases, red blood cell damage and anemia are possible. Skin contact with paradichlorobenzene can result in a burning sensation and local irritation.
"
"The fumes produced by both naphthalene and paradichlorobenzene can be very irritating to the nose, eyes and lungs. Pets who are around mothball fumes may develop red, runny eyes, a runny nose, sneezing, and/or coughing.
"
"Cats are more sensitive to mothballs than are dogs, and other species can become sick after exposure as well. For example, veterinarians have reported several instances of birds developing symptoms like lethargy, weakness, and difficulty breathing after inhaling fumes from mothballs. At least one bird died as a result.
"
"Clearly the best way to protect pets from naphthalene and paradichlorobenzene is to keep them away from mothballs (far away if we’re talking about a bird). But sometimes, despite our best efforts, animals do get exposed. What should a pet parent do then?
"
"Eating one naphthalene mothball is enough to make cats and small dogs very sick so this is not a situation to be ignored. If you suspect that your pet has eaten a mothball (or been exposed by another route), call your veterinarian immediately. It may be possible to get your pet to vomit up the mothball if they have eaten it in the last couple of hours.
"
"Depending on your pet’s condition and how far away you are from the clinic, your veterinarian may recommend that you induce vomiting at home or that you bring your pet in for the procedure. In either case, unless you and your vet are certain that your pet has no more naphthalene or paradichlorobenzene in its system, further treatment will be necessary. This may include gastric lavage (washing out the stomach), administration of activated charcoal, or fluid therapy and drugs to limit vomiting, seizures, and damage to the liver and gastrointestinal tract. If the results of blood work show that your pet has anemia, a blood transfusion and medications that protect red blood cells may also be needed.
"
"Since treatment can vary depending on whether the mothballs were made with naphthalene or paradichlorobenzene, if you are unsure about what type of chemical is in the mothball your pet may have eaten, a neat trick can help you and your veterinarian figure out how to proceed.

"Oral ulceration and chronic ulcerative paradental stomatitis (CUPS) is a disease of the mouth which causes painful ulcers on the gums and mucosal lining of the mouth cavity. The cause of this condition has been determined to be a hypersensitive immune response to bacteria and plaque on the tooth surfaces, and sometimes signs of CUPS will start subsequent to a dental cleaning, when these materials are loosened in the mouth.
"
"While it appears that manipulation and antigenic stimulation (substances that stimulate the production of antibodies in the body) in the oral cavity may trigger stomatitis, it is also believed that such animals would probably have eventually developed the disease anyway. In some cases, the only resolution is to remove all of the teeth, so that the bacteria that is normally found on the surface of the teeth is no longer present in the mouth at all.
"
"Certain breeds of dogs appear to be at higher risk for developing this disease. Maltese, cavalier king charles spaniels, cocker spaniels and Bouvier des Flandres have been found to have a higher incidence. One of the complications of CUPS is idiopathic osteomyelitis, inflammation of the bone and marrow, which cocker spaniels have been found to be predisposed to.

"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition, such as chewing on cords or other inappropriate objects, recent illnesses, and the usual dental care that is provided. Your veterinarian will exam your dog's oral cavity carefully to determine the extent of the inflammation, or whether any of the teeth are obviously in need of care. Standard tests will include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel in order to detect an underlying disease. Diagnostic imaging is also standard in diagnosing dental conditions. X-rays will be taken to determine bone involvement and judge the extent of idiopathic osteomyelitis.
"
"Often chronic antigenic stimulation (from a chronic disease condition) will predispose an animal to development of oral ulceration and stomatitis. (Antigens are substances that stimulate the production of antibodies in the body.)
"
"
"
"Underlying diseases will be treated as necessary. Often, dogs that have not been able to eat normally for some time will need nutritional therapy to make up for it. A soft diet with fluid therapy and/or a feeding tube will be put in place immediately if your dog is anorexic, and your veterinarian may also recommend vitamin supplements.
"
"Pets with idiopathic osteomyelitis should have the necrotic bone removed. The gingival flap should be closed and broad-spectrum antibiotics will be prescribed to protect the dog from infection.
"
"Antimicrobials can be used to treat primary and secondary bacterial infections, and may be used intermittently between cleanings for therapeutic assistance, but chronic, or long term use could lead to antibiotic resistance. Anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive drugs can be used to treat the inflammation, and can make your dog more comfortable in the short term, but there are potential long-term side effects of corticosteroid usage, so your doctor will consider this when deciding on which pain therapy to prescribe. Topical therapy, such as chlorhexidine solution or antibacterial gel may also be used directly on the gums and in the mouth, and your veterinarian may also be able to prescribe a topical pain medication that can be placed on the gums and mouth to lessen the pain.
"
"Dogs with LPS and CUPS should receive dental prophylaxis (preventive treatment) twice a day, or as often as is possible at home to prevent plaque accumulation. Topical antimicrobials may also be applied to your dog's tooth and gingival surfaces. Patients should have their teeth cleaned when diagnosed and they should be frequently scheduled for veterinary dentals (during which they will receive periodontal therapy and extraction of diseased teeth).

"Multiple myeloma is a rare type of blood cancer that can develop in plasma cells, which are white blood cells that make antibodies to help your dog’s body fight off germs that can cause them to get sick. Plasma cells are found in bone marrow, the spongy material in the center of your dog’s bones.
"
"Plasma cells that become cancerous make abnormal antibodies that can hurt instead of help your dog. These cancerous plasma cells build up faster than healthy plasma cells and eventually become the main type of plasma in your dog’s bone marrow. Multiple myeloma typically starts in multiple places within the bone marrow.
"
"The abnormal antibodies coming from cancerous plasma cells can make their way to other organs in the body such as the kidneys. This can cause these organs to not function properly.
"
"It can take years for symptoms of multiple myeloma to appear, but your dog may experience:
"
"Signs of pain, such as more sensitivity to touch
"
"Lameness
"
"Weight loss
"
"Abnormally low numbers of white blood cells and blood platelets
"
"Abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood
"
"Bone damage from the breaking down of bone cells, causing the spinal cord to compress and bones to break most often in the spine, pelvis, ribs, skull, or areas of the leg closest to the trunk of your dog’s body
"
"Kidney failure
"
"Heart disease
"
"There is no single known cause for multiple myeloma. Exposure to chemicals, constant activation of the immune system, illness from a viral infection, and genetics are all suspected to play a role.
"
"The Giant Schnauzer, Labrador, Golden Retriever, and German Shepherd breeds have higher rates of multiple myeloma, but it is not clear why.
"
"Gender does not seem to be a risk factor for multiple myeloma, although neutered females and intact males are overrepresented in some case studies.
"
"As with most other cancers, older dogs are more likely to be affected by the disease. The average age of diagnosis for multiple myeloma is eight to nine years old.
"
"Multiple myeloma is very rare and makes up less than 1% of all cancers in dogs, so it may not be the first suspected cause of your dog’s symptoms.
"
"Multiple myeloma has four classic criteria that can be tested to confirm its presence. At least two must be met for a diagnosis to be made.
"
"Your dog’s vet will do several different tests to find which, if any, of these signs are found:
"
"Multiple myeloma does not result in a solid tumor mass because it is a blood cancer found throughout the body’s bloodstream and bone marrow. This can make staging for multiple myeloma (the process of figuring out how much cancer is in your dog’s body and where) more difficult. Regardless, staging may be a helpful indicator of how far your dog’s cancer has progressed.
"
"Multiple myeloma can go unnoticed for a number of years before clinical signs can be seen, so it's hard to tell how long your dog has been living with the disease. However, your veterinarian may be able to estimate how severe your dog’s multiple myeloma is by comparing relative levels of abnormal antibodies and proteins in their blood or urine.
"
"Most dogs with multiple myeloma tolerate treatment well and can greatly benefit from it.
"
"Chemotherapy is often the first choice of treatment. Approximately 80 to 95% of dogs diagnosed with multiple myeloma benefit from chemotherapy within three to six weeks.
"
" Oral chemotherapy medications that may be prescribed include:
"
"Radiation can also help to treat multiple myeloma and ease bone pain to make your dog more comfortable.
"
"Fluid therapy may be suggested to make sure your dog is hydrated and has the right level of electrolytes. This can be especially helpful for dogs with kidney failure due to multiple myeloma.
"
"Anti-inflammatory medicines, such as corticosteroids like prednisone or dexamethasone, may be prescribed to help reduce swelling. Inflammation is an important natural reaction to injury and infection in the body, but too much inflammation can be painful and can damage healthy cells. Furosemide is a medication that can help reduce swelling. It can be particularly helpful for dogs with kidney failure and heart disease due to their multiple myeloma.
"
"Bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate, may be incorporated into your dog’s treatment plan as well. These can be useful for stopping the breakdown of bone cells, which helps to decrease the level of calcium in your dog’s blood, ultimately improving their bone condition and relieving pain.
"
"Multiple myeloma is rarely cured, and dogs who achieve remission are expected to relapse. Fortunately, multiple myeloma is manageable so long as your dog is checked by their veterinarian often. This means that regularly scheduled blood tests and examinations by a veterinarian will be needed.
"
"Doing things that help to keep your dog otherwise healthy and comfortable while they are living with the disease can help. For example, your dog’s veterinarian may suggest feeding them a well-balanced diet low in carbohydrates and high in cancer-fighting compounds like omega-3 fatty acids, giving them a daily multivitamin to ensure their nutritional needs are met, or administering medication as prescribed to control their pain levels.
"
"Talk to your veterinarian to help you figure out which practices may be best for your dog.
"
"Dogs with multiple myeloma can live 18 months or longer post-diagnosis if they receive treatment. Chemotherapy treatment typically results in the longest median survival times.
"
"In a study of 60 dogs with multiple myeloma that were treated with the chemotherapy drug melphalan and the corticosteroid drug prednisone, 43% had complete remission, 49% had partial remission, and 8% did not respond to treatment.
"
"The average cost for chemotherapy in dogs varies depending on what drugs are used and can range from $100 to $500 per dose. If radiation is necessary, the cost will be much higher, as radiation in dogs requires them to be under general anesthesia and might cost anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000, depending on how many sessions are needed.

"There are several methods for performing a safe abortion for a dog, as well as instances in which the pregnancy could spontaneously abort or miscarry. It is important to note that dogs can experience spontaneous abortions and lost pregnancies for a variety of medical reasons.
"
"If a dog owner is considering aborting an unwanted pregnancy, seeking professional medical advice and assistance is recommended, so that a full risk and side effect evaluation can be done. In the event that the pregnancy is lost or spontaneously aborted, your pet should be evaluated and monitored, as there are several possible medical conditions that could be the cause.The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats.
"
"If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"If your dog has experienced a miscarriage, the most common thing you may notice is abnormal vaginal bleeding; in some cases an expelled fetus may be found. The most common cause of a spontaneous abortion is fetal death due to a hormonal imbalance.
"
"In the case of a planned abortion, bleeding is the most common symptom following the procedure. You will need to closely monitor your dog so that any side effects or health related issues can be responded to quickly.
"
"Some types of the most common causes of spontaneous abortions in dogs are:
"
"Standard blood tests can be used to detect the presence of parasites or B. Canis. If the pregnancy loss is due to another reason, an abnormal amount of discharge will be noticeable. A veterinarian can use an ultrasound to detect a viable pregnancy, or to look for anything remaining in the dog's uterus following a miscarriage or termination. This is because the dog's uterus will occasionally be unable to expel all the pregnancy matter effectively on its own (e.g., placental tissue), leading to infection or internal hemorrhaging.
"
"[ pagebreak]
"
"
"
"For dogs that have experienced a spontaneous abortion due to bacteria or a parasite, a veterinarian will diagnose the condition and offer a variety of options for medical treatment. In addition, the dog should be carefully monitored for signs of a more serious medical condition.
"
"Following a miscarriage, there can be a great deal of discomfort and/or some vaginal bleeding or abnormal discharge. Many cases exist where some long-term bacterial issues arise. Pet owners should carefully observe the behavior of their dog to ensure no serious problems develop as a result.

"Noninflammatory metabolic myopathy is a rare muscle disease associated with metabolic disorders like various enzyme defects or storage of abnormal metabolic byproducts and others.
"
"Little is known about how the disorder affects dogs exactly, but English springer spaniels, American cocker spaniels, German shepherds, Akitas, curly-coated retrievers, clumber spaniels, Sussex spaniels, old English sheepdogs, Lapland dogs are all predisposed to the disease. 
"
"Typically, a dog will be born with non-inflammatory metabolic myopathy or acquire it later in life due to problems in metabolism. However, underlying factors may include:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which may show abnormalities related to metabolic problems involved. For example, the biochemistry profile may show abnormal levels of serum creatine (enzyme found in muscle, brain, and other tissues) and abnormally low levels of glucose (hypoglycemia).
"
"Your veterinarian may also choose more enzyme assays and other specific testing to determine the dog's levels of amino acids, organic acids, and creatine. DNA-based tests, meanwhile, are used to identify specific carriers.
"
"Often, a muscle tissue sample will be sent to a veterinary pathologist for further evaluation. This may reveal abnormal accumulation of fats or glycogen within muscle cells.
"
"
"
"Treatment varies with the type of metabolic defect and extent of your dog's symptoms. In most cases, there is little to be done for those suffering from metabolic defects. If the dog suffers from seizures, decreased body glucose, or brain issues, it will need to be hospitalized and placed in intensive care.
"
"Depending on the type of metabolic defect, diet restrictions may be put in place, especially if the defect has led to hypoglycemia. Discuss with your veterinarian about a feeding plan and do not allow the dog to exercise strenuously.
"
"Overall prognosis depends on the type and extent of the metabolic defect, but a veterinarian will always advise against breeding the dog due to high probability of passing along the defect.
"
"Brucellosis is a contagious bacterial disease that affects several animal species. In dogs, this condition is caused by a bacterium known as Brucella canis. The bacteria are typically spread through breeding and through contact with tissue remains from miscarried pregnancies, but may also be spread through an infected mother’s milk. An infected bitch may spontaneously abort the pregnancy, or may have a marked decrease in her fertility levels. If she does carry the puppies to term, they often still die as a result of infection, since puppies have undeveloped immune systems that are not capable of fighting these aggressive bacteria.
"
"Brucellosis is highly contagious amongst dogs. It frequently affects kenneled dogs, but dogs that have never been kenneled may also become infected. This disease is responsible for a decrease in 75 percent of pups that are weaned in breeding kennels.
"
"The Brucella bacterium has zoonotic properties, meaning that it can affect humans, and possibly other animals as well. Though chances for human infection are found to be quite low, it is still best to take preventative precautions while treating an infected dog. An extra sanitary environment, along with personal protection (e.g., disposable gloves) should be standard until the infection has been eradicated entirely.
"
"While brucellosis can affect any breed of dog, it is commonly seen in beagles. The causative organism has a tendency to replicate successfully in the reproductive organs of both male and female dogs.  It causes abortion and infertility in female dogs, and testicular atrophy and infertility in male dogs.
"
"Female:
"
"Male:
"
"Both genders:
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Once your veterinarian has thoroughly examined your dog, standard fluid samples will be taken for laboratory testing. However, often it is the case with Brucella canis that it is not diagnosed with standard blood tests; laboratory test results are usually normal.
"
"A combination of various serological tests may be necessary in order to confirm the diagnosis, but usually, a titer test will verify that your dog is infected with the Brucella bacterium. This test measures your dog's antibody levels and will show whether there are specific antibodies to the Brucella organism in your dog's blood. To confirm the presence of Brucella, your veterinarian will take blood samples to grow the organism on culture media in the laboratory. Similarly, cultures of vaginal fluids or semen can also be used for isolation of the causative organism. As the lymph nodes are also affected by this infection, a lymph node biopsy can also be used in some cases for diagnostic purposes.
"
"
"
"The major goal of therapy is to eradicate the causative organism from the dog, but this may be difficult to achieve in all animals. Antibiotic treatment is employed to treat these patients, but treatment is not always 100 percent effective. Breeding a dog that has or has had brucellosis is not recommended under any circumstance. For this reason, your veterinarian will be insistent on spaying or neutering your dog to prevent any chance of contamination.
"
"In kenneled situations, euthanasia is often recommended.
"
"Brucellosis has the potential for being spread zoonotically to humans. For this reason, people who have autoimmune disorders, or who are susceptible to infection should not keep a dog that is infected with brucellosis.
"
"This disease can be difficult to treat, so you must adhere to the recommendations and guidelines given to you by your veterinarian. After the initial treatment, some tests may need to be conducted again every month for three months in order to evaluate progress. If your dog is not responding well to the treatment, depending on the severity of your dog's condition, your veterinarian will recommend re-treatment, neutering, or euthanasia.

"Regular monitoring of the disease status in kennels is important, and quarantine measures, along with testing, should be conducted before introduction of new animals to the kennel.
"
"If you dog is, or has been infected, do not sell it or give it to anyone else and do not breed your dog under any circumstance.  Animals that have been diagnosed with brucellosis are considered positive for this disease for the rest of their lives; periodic treatment with antibiotics to reduce the number of bacteria in the body is the only option for minimizing symptoms and for shedding of causative organisms.
"
"All intact male and female dogs should be tested for Brucella canis every three to six months, and all breeding dogs should be tested before breeding takes place.

"To understand valve disease in dogs, think about the heart as a pump. The left side of the heart pumps freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the dog’s body. The mitral valve is a regulator of the blood flow between the two left chambers, the atrium, and the ventricle. When it is working correctly, the mitral valve prevents any backflow of blood from the ventricle back into the atrium when the heart muscle contracts.
"
"With mitral valve disease the valve will not function as well, and some blood may leak in the wrong direction when the muscle contracts. A small amount of backflow is not an issue, but often, over time, the valve becomes thicker and stiffer and the volume of backflowing blood increases. 
"
"As a result, the heart becomes a less efficient pump. The heart muscle will try to compensate by getting thicker, which increases the overall size of the heart. In some dogs, mitral valve disease will progress enough so that fluid begins to accumulate in the lungs simply because the heart cannot keep up. Accumulation of the fluid in the lungs is known as pulmonary edema. Its presence indicates the dog is in congestive heart failure.
"
"Two other names for mitral valve disease in dogs:
"
"Degenerative mitral valve disease
"
"Canine myxomatous mitral valve disease
"
"Early in the disease, there will be no symptoms. In later stages, you may see:
"
"Exercise intolerance (tires easily or after little effort)
"
"Cough
"
"Rapid breathing
"
"Increased effort in breathing
"
"Clear nasal discharge
"
"Unable to rest comfortably, moving around
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Mitral valve disease is a common condition that occurs in dogs, especially smaller-breed dogs as they age. Research has shown that 85% of small-breed dogs will have mitral valve disease by the time they reach 13.
"
"Mitral valve disease is likely to have a genetic component because it is seen frequently in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Dachshunds, along with some terrier breeds.
"
"Physical exams help to evaluate the heart for murmurs, which are the earliest sign of mitral valve disease. Murmurs are detected and graded when your veterinarian listens to your dogs’s chest with a stethoscope.
"
"Medical history is reviewed by your veterinarian to note any recent changes in breathing, cough, or differences in behavior that could indicate progressing mitral valve disease.
"
"Radiographs (X-rays of the chest) are performed to check heart size and shape as well as evidence of fluid in the lungs.
"
"NT ProBNP testing is done on blood samples to detect strain on the heart muscle.  Elevations indicate mitral valve disease is present and severe enough to cause heart muscle changes.
"
"Echocardiograms (ultrasounds of the heart): This diagnostic test, usually done by a veterinary cardiologist, shows the heart muscle and valves and measures heart function, and is considered the best way to diagnose mitral valve disease.
"
"ECGs (electrocardiograms) check for arrythmias (abnormal electrical activity).
"
"Blood pressure measurement: Done to check for high blood pressure.
"
"Complete blood counts, chemistry panels, and urinalysis are lab tests done to monitor health, organ function, and kidney values. These tests are especially important if dogs are taking medications or if there are issues with blood pressure.
"
"Veterinary cardiologists have created a classification system to categorize the severity and to mark progression of the disease.
"
"Stage A: No disease noted yet, but dogs in this group are at high risk of developing the disease (breed-specific ).
"
"Stage B1: Dogs in this stage have very minimal leakage of blood between the atrium and the ventricle, and mild enlargement of the heart muscle.
"
"Stage B2: More leakage is present and the heart has grown significantly in size. This stage is usually when medications are prescribed.
"
"Stage C: In this stage, dogs have congestive heart failure and require medications for treatment. Stage C pets are treated with standard medications doses, and depending on the severity, may require hospitalization with supplemental oxygen for initial treatment.
"
"Stage D: In this stage, dogs have congestive heart failure and are not responding to standard doses of the medications needed to treat them. Very aggressive doses of medications are used, but often there is limited response. Dogs in Stage D require hospitalization for oxygen support and IV medications to try to improve their condition.
"
"Treatment is dependent on the stage of disease progression. Dogs in Stages A or B1 require monitoring, but usually no medication. Stages B2, C, and D require medication.
"
"Medications:
"
"Furosemide and torsemide: These medications are diuretics, which remove fluid from the body and minimize the ongoing work and stress on the heart.
"
"Spironolactone: This is also a diuretic used to eliminate fluid. Spironolactone works in a different part of the kidney than furosemide, and they are often paired together in treatments to help maintain an electrolyte balance.
"
"Benazepril and enalapril are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) medications. They protect the kidneys from some of the secondary effects of heart disease and also control high blood pressure.
"
"Pimobendan is a medication used to improve the strength and function of heart muscle. 
"
"Supportive care:
"
"For dogs in acute congestive heart failure, hospitalization with supplemental oxygen and injectable medication is often needed to stabilize their condition.
"
"Once they are stable on oral medication, they can be cared for at home by their families. It is very important that they are closely monitored.
"
"Dogs will now need plenty of rest and should not overexercise, but if they have the energy, short walks and some playtime are fine.
"
"The diuretic medications will make them more thirsty. Always give unlimited access to drinking water and extra potty breaks.
"
"Salty treats and table foods should be avoided.
"
"There is evidence that supplemental omega-3 fatty acids are helpful for dogs with heart disease. Some prescription diets have this, or your veterinarian can recommend a supplement.
"
"Mitral valve disease may or may not progress to the extent that it needs to be medically managed. It is important that if a murmur is identified, it is monitored regularly by your veterinarian, with referral to a cardiologist for echocardiograms and additional recommendations if needed.
"
"New dietary research is exploring the benefit of diet in preventing the progression of this disease. Dogs with heart disease need adequate protein in their diets and should not be obese, as this increases stress on the heart. Diets containing omega-3 and medium chain triglycerides, magnesium, and vitamin E are shown to provide much-needed nutrients to overstressed heart muscle.
"
"Mitral valve disease is considered a managed disease, with monitoring and treatment done to prevent the dog’s condition from advancing to the next stage. Mitral valve disease is not considered curable in dogs at this time. The prognosis varies widely, and some dogs will remain in Stage B1 and their lifespan will not be shortened. Other dogs progress steadily into advanced stages. Once a dog has progressed into Stage C (congestive heart failure), the prognosis is guarded.

"Lysosomal storage diseases are primarily genetic and are caused by a lack of the enzymes that are needed to perform metabolic functions. It is a rare disease that most commonly occurs in puppies. The disease causes an accumulation of various substances that would otherwise be eliminated by the enzymes, and which become stored in the dog’s tissues in abnormal amounts (usually occurring in the nervous system). As a result, cells swell and can no longer function normally. Unfortunately, lysosomal storage diseases are always fatal.
"
"Humans also suffer from separate but similar lysosomal storage diseases, and for that reason this disease has been studied more than the commonly inherited dog disorders.
"
"The following breeds are most likely to have the disease:
"
"If your dog has these symptoms and is one of the previously listed breeds, your veterinarian will want to know your dog’s history so that a diagnosis can be made. The following tests are likely to be performed:
"
"
"
"If the dog is weak and dehydrated, an IV will be inserted and fluids and electrolytes will be administered. A dietary plan will be also be arranged to ward off hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Activity must be limited.  Your dog should not climb stairs, for example. Careful monitoring is required because there is a high risk of developing secondary infections.
"
"Restrict activity and be alert to the dog's symptoms. In addition, maintain the prescribed nutritional plan. Blood sugar, growth, and hydration status must be monitored regularly. This disease is progressive, and unfortunately, it is ultimately fatal.
"
"Remember that the disease is genetic, and inbreeding should be carefully avoided when there is a defective gene in the family. Dogs that have the disease should also never be mated.

"Much like in humans, the system of membranes which envelops the dog's central nervous system is called the meninges. If this system becomes inflamed, it is referred to as meningitis. Meningoencephalitis, meanwhile, is the inflammation of the meninges and brain, and meningomyelitis is the inflammation of the meninges and spinal cord.
"
"Inflammation of meninges commonly leads to secondary inflammation of the brain and/or spinal cord, resulting in various neurological complications. Long-term inflammation can also obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -- the protective and nourishing fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord -- which leads to accumulation of CSF in the brain and thus severe complications such as seizures and paresis.
"
"Neurological symptoms often associated with meningitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningomyelitis such as impaired movement, altered mental state, and seizures, may be profound and progressive. Other symptoms generally seen in dogs suffering from one of these conditions include:
"
"The most common cause of meningitis is a bacterial infection in the brain and/or spinal cord originating from elsewhere in the body. Meningoencephalitis, meanwhile, is usually due to infections of the ears, eyes, or nasal cavity. And meningomyelitis generally proceeds following diskospondylitis and osteomyelitis. In puppies and dogs with compromised immune system, such infections commonly reach the brain and spinal cord via the blood.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination and several laboratory tests -- such as complete blood count (CBC), blood culture biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- to help identify and isolate the type of infection.
"
"Biochemistry profile, for example, may indicate liver and kidney involvement, while blood testing may reveal an increased number of white blood cells, which is evidence of an ongoing infection. Urinalysis may also reveal pus and bacteria in the dog's urine, an indication of urinary tract infections.
"
"Other tools often used to identify the infectious agent involved include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), abdominal ultrasounds, thoracic and abdominal X-rays, and samples from the skin, eyes, nasal discharge, and sputum.
"
"One of the most important diagnostic tests, however, is CSF (or cerebrospinal fluid) analysis. A sample of your dog's CSF will be collected and sent to a laboratory for culturing and further evaluation.
"
"
"
"In severe cases of meningitis, meningoencephalitis, or meningomyelitis, the dog will be hospitalized to prevent more severe complications. Once the causative organism is identified, your veterinarian will employ antibiotics intravenously to maximize their effectiveness. Antiepileptic drugs and corticosteroids may also be prescribed to control seizures and reduce inflammation, respectively. Dogs that are severely dehydrated, meanwhile, will undergo immediate fluid therapy.
"
"Rapid and aggressive treatment is vital for a successful outcome, although its effectiveness is highly variable and overall prognosis is not favorable. Unfortunately, many dogs die from these type of infections once it reaches the central nervous system, despite treatment.
"
"However, if treatment is successful it may take more than four weeks for all the symptoms to subside. The dog's activity should be restricted during this time and until it is stabilized.
"
"Treat your dog’s ear, eyes, and nose infections promptly to avoid spreading these infections to the nervous system.

"Mesotheliomas are rare tumors derived from the cellular tissue that lines the cavities and interior structures of the body. These linings are called the epithelial linings, specifically the mesothelium. The mesothelial lining, specifically, is a membranous epithelial lining that is derived from the mesoderm cell layer, with its main functions being to line the body cavity, to cover and protect the internal organs, and to facilitate movement within the body cavity (coelom).
"
"Mesotheliomas are the result of abnormal division and replication of mesothelial cells, and their migration to other sites in the body. This cellular behavior can occur in the thoracic cavity, the abdominal cavity, the pericardial sac around the heart, and for male dogs, in the scrotum. The resultant tumors will often displace internal organs, causing gastrointestinal or cardiac symptoms. Mesotheliomas also produce a lot of fluid, making microscopic (cytologic) examination of fluid samples an extremely relevant diagnostic tool.
"
"The German shepherd is the breed most commonly affected by mesotheliomas.
"
"Exposure to asbestos is one of the known causes for mesothelioma formation.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background health history, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. X-rays of the chest and abdominal cavities will be the most important diagnostic aid for confirming mesothelioma. Radiograph and ultrasound imaging can also be used to show effusion (escape of fluid from the vessels) or masses in the body's cavities, and in the pericardial sac (the lining surrounding the heart).
"
"Your doctor will also take a fluid sample for cytologic (microscopic) examination of the fluid.  Exploratory surgery, or a laparoscopy (surgery of the abdomen), can be performed for removal of mesothelial masses for cellular examination in the laboratory.
"
"
"
"Most pets can be treated on an outpatient basis. If your dog is having trouble breathing, it should be given a quiet place to rest, safe from activity and anything alse that would be an exertion. If your dog has an excess of fluid in any of its body cavities as a result of the mesothelioma, such as in the chest or abdomen, your veterinarian will need to hospitalize it for a short period of time in order to drain these cavities. If fluid has collected in the pericardial sac, surgery to relieve the pressure will be required.
"
"Limit your dog’s activity until it is breathing easier and this is no longer of concern. Slow walks close to home, and gentle playtime will be best until your dog has recovered. You will need to provide a safe and quiet space for your dog, away from active children and from other animals while it recovers. If your veterinarian has prescribed cisplatin chemotherapy to treat the mesothelioma, you will need to continue to monitor your dog's  progress with frequent follow-up visits in order to test your dog's kidney health, since some animals will have a toxic reaction to the chemotherapy medicine. Your veterinarian will also want to monitor your pet's chest and pleural cavity, using X-ray imaging, to be sure the mesothelioma has not metastasized.

"Megaesophagus is a condition that decreases mobility in the muscles of the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth and stomach. 
"
"
This decreased muscle function leads to esophageal dilation, or enlargement. Normally, when dogs swallow the food stimulates the muscle in the esophagus to contract, pushing the food from the mouth into the stomach. 
"
"
In dogs with megaesophagus, the muscles in the esophagus cannot properly coordinate this swallowing movement. As a result, food, and liquid accumulate in the esophagus, stretching it and preventing nutrients from being properly absorbed in the stomach. 
"
"
While dogs affected by megaesophagus may have an excellent quality of life, they can be difficult to manage and keep healthy. A close relationship with a veterinarian, time, patience, and understanding of the condition are needed. 
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The hallmark sign of megaesophagus is regurgitation. Keep in mind that regurgitation is different from vomiting. Vomiting is an active process that involves gagging, retching, and the body actively, often forcibly, ejecting the contents of the stomach. 
"
"Regurgitation, in contrast, is a passive process. Typically, dogs will open their mouth and food or liquid appears to fall out without any heaving or stomach contractions. Regurgitation frequently occurs many hours after a meal and typically does not have bile, because it was never in the stomach.
"
"
Dogs with megaesophagus may have a difficult time swallowing and show excessive salivating. Often, during the regurgitation process, the esophageal contents may be expelled through the nose and even accidentally breathed into the lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia. These dogs can become very sick with fever, difficulty breathing, lethargy, and coughing. 
"
"
Dogs with megaesophagus typically have ravenous appetites, but they develop poor, thin, weak body conditions due to the inability to get nutrients into their stomach for processing. Sometimes, pet parents and veterinarians may notice a small bulge in the neck when the esophagus is distended. 
"
"In rare cases, megaesophagus can be reversed. However, most cases are permanent and require life-long care.
"
"Primary megaesophagus (present at birth) is not well understood by veterinarians, but most cases of primary megaesophagus might occur due to incomplete nerve development in the esophagus. Some breeds have a known genetic marker causing congenital megaesophagus, including: 
"
"Wire-Haired and Smooth Haired Fox Terrier
"
"Miniature Schnauzer
"
"Chinese Shar-Pei
"
"German Shepherd
"
"
A congenital form of myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular condition) causes megaesophagus and is reported in the following breeds: 
"
"Jack Russell Terriers
"
"Springer Spaniels
"
"Long-Haired Miniature Dachshunds
"
"Golden Retrievers
"
"Labrador Retrievers
"
"Samoyed 
"
"
Secondary, or acquired megaesophagus is more common and may occur at any age. Acquired myasthenia gravis is the most common causes for secondary megaesophagus, but any other disease that affects the function of the esophagus may cause this condition.
"
"
Acquired myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular autoimmune disease that destroys the connection between nerves and muscle, including the esophagus, and causes general skeletal muscle weakness. 
"
"
Approximately 25% of dogs with acquired megaesophagus have myasthenia gravis. While the symptoms are like congenital myasthenia gravis, the cause, testing, and treatment are different. 
"
"
Obstructive disorders may cause megaesophagus by physically blocking the esophagus from functioning normally.  In these cases, the muscle and nerves of the esophagus are normal, but chronic distention directly in front of the obstruction causes muscle dysfunction.
"
"Examples of obstructive secondary megaesophagus include:
"
"Some medications can cause a narrowing of the esophagus, and food cannot adequately pass.
"
"Foreign bodies stuck in the esophagus can prevent normal swallowing.
"
"Cancer in or around the esophagus can also partially block the esophagus. 
"
"Vascular ring anomalies are caused by abnormal development of vessels near the heart. Fetal vessels that should disappear by birth remain intact, encircling and constricting the esophagus. 
"
"Disorders (many of them autoimmune) that affect the body’s muscles can also lead to megaesophagus, including:
"
"Polymyositis
"
"Systemic lupus erythematosus
"
"Dermatomyositis  
"
"There are many other causes of megaesophagus, including: 
"
"Central nervous system neoplasia
"
" Botulism and tetanus
"
"Endocrine disease, like Addison’s disease and possibly hypothyroidism
"
"Toxicosis 
"
"Esophagitis, or esophageal irritation and inflammation
"
"Nerve issues 
"
"Some breeds, especially large breed dogs, are also more likely to acquire megaesophagus. These include: 
"
"German Shepherd
"
"Great Dane
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"Pug
"
"Chinese Shar-Pei
"
"Veterinarians often suspect megaesophagus based on clinical signs and history alone. To confirm the diagnosis, multiple tests may be recommended. 
"
"
Radiology: Megaesophagus is routinely diagnosed through x-rays. The esophagus is not normally seen on x-rays, but the mass of food and/or air can be detected, which may lead to a diagnosis. X-rays can diagnose megaesophagus but do not always determine the cause. 
"
"
Fluoroscopy: This test is similar to an x-ray but is performed in real-time during swallowing to assess the esophagus’ ability to contract. 
"
"
Other tests: Esophagoscopy (video scope into the esophagus), blood tests, tests for various neuromuscular and endocrine diseases, and muscle biopsies may all be used to determine the underlying cause of megaesophagus.
 
"
"Treating the underlying condition is most important when treating megaesophagus. Some forms of megaesophagus can be reversed or cured, but there is no guarantee. Especially depending on severity and length of time, even if the underlying disorder is treated, the damage done may be irreversible. 
"
"
For dogs with this condition, management centers on making sure they get their nutritional needs met, as well as receiving any supportive therapy. This means monitoring closely for serious side effects like aspiration pneumonia. This type of pneumonia is the most common complication of megaesophagus, upwards of 40% of dogs have pneumonia at the time of their diagnosis. 
"
"
Supportive therapy for dogs with megaesophagus includes:
"
"Raising food and water bowls to let gravity help the eating process. 
"
"Food bowls should be at head height
"
"Bailey Chairs are used to keep the dog in an upright position for at least 10 minutes, preferably 20-30 minutes, preventing most of the food and liquid from accumulating in the esophagus. These chairs look like highchairs for dogs and can be custom-built for growing puppies and all sizes of adult dogs. 
"
"Changing the form of food based on the dog’s specific needs. This may mean changing their diet to gruel, meat balls, canned food, or even liquid. 
"
"Providing smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day. 
"
"Encouraging dogs to sleep with their front end slightly elevated. 
"
"Medications can be prescribed to treat specific side effects or complications, as required:
"
"To treat irritation of the esophagus
"
"Sildenafil may help the number of regurgitation episodes and has been associated with weight gain.
"
"Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat aspiration pneumonia.
"
"Fortunately, although this condition requires management, dogs can lead happy and relatively normal lives. 
"
"
Dogs typically have better outcomes the sooner megaesophagus is diagnosed. Prognosis also improves if a dog has not experienced aspiration pneumonia.
"
"
Pet parent dedication, patience, and close monitoring with a veterinarian are key to managing megaesophagus dogs successfully. Veterinarians will want to frequently examine these dogs to monitor weight and body condition and bloodwork parameters, in addition to screening for signs of aspiration pneumonia. 
 
"
"Masticatory Muscle Myositis (MMM), or eosinophilic myositis, is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the muscles of the head and jaw required for chewing (or mastication). Myositis means muscle inflammation (swelling).
"
"This disease attacks the special fibers found only in the muscle of the head and jaw, and this extremely painful condition inflames muscles, preventing your dog from opening his or her mouth to eat, chew, or play with toys.
"
"The disease affects the Type 2M muscle fibers, which are unique to the temporalis and masseter muscles of the head and jaw. There are acute and chronic forms of this disease which describe the progression of the disease. Dogs will progress from the acute to the chronic form of the disease over time, if untreated.
"
"Both male and female adult dogs can be affected and are mostly young- to middle-aged dogs.
"
"Most common breeds affected include:
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Retrieving breeds (such as Labradors and Goldens)
"
"Doberman Pinschers
"
"The acute phase may often go unnoticed or confused with other conditions of the head, eye, teeth, mouth, and jaw, as symptoms can be vague. Sometimes, the symptoms can be confused with other diseases that involve inflammation of the tonsils, enlarged lymph nodes under the jaw and neck, or protrusion of the eyeball (exophthalmos) which is caused by the swelling of inflamed muscles in the head.
"
"Maternal behavioral problems are classified as either excessive maternal behavior in the absence of newborn pups or the lack of maternal behavior when dealing with the mother's own young. (Other types of maternal behavior problem also exist, but they are still poorly defined.)
"
"Though no genetic component has yet been attributed to these behavioral problems,the fact that Jack Russell terriers seem to be predisposed to the behavior indicate the possibility of a genetic component.
"
"Inadequate Maternal Behavior 
"
"Excessive Maternal Behavior 
"
"The lack of maternal behavior shown by mothers with newborn pups, especially after caesarean section, has been attributed to gradual decrease in oxytocin, which is important during the sensitive period of acceptance of dam’s own neonates. Conversely, when there is an absence of newborns, excessive maternal behavior is due to the increased progesterone levels resulting from estrus in un-bred bitches, followed by an immediate and sharp decline in the progesterone levels.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- though the results are usually normal unless a disease is present.
"
"
"
"Medical treatment may be required in some females, but proper care and management typically help in resolving such behavioral problems. Spaying should be delayed for at least four months after estrus to avoid abnormal behavior. That being said, spaying has been suggested to help in preventing future excessive maternal behavior.
"
"In case of lack of maternal behavior the bitch should be fed freely to encourage lactation and meet her energy demands. Nursing females should also be placed in quiet, comfortable, and dark area, where she will not be disturbed by other people and animals. If the bitch is seen biting her neonates, she may require a muzzle or may need to be removed from the room. If aggression persists, the separation can be done for several weeks until aggression subsides.
"
"Conversely, in case of excessive maternal behavior, the bitch should be separated from the stolen puppies and their actual mother. Moreover, the mothered objects like stuffed animals should be removed from the environment of the bitch. In these females, food intake should be restricted for few days to prevent lactation.
"
"Many experts recommend against breeding bitches with a history of maternal behavioral problems, as these problems are shown in subsequent pregnancies.

"Initially, the acute phase may include vague symptoms such as:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Fever
"
"Unwilling to eat
"
"Drooling
"
"As time goes on, the symptoms will progress, and the chronic form of Masticatory Myositis may include:
"
"Muscle shrinkage as the bones of the head become more prominent
"
"Difficulty for your dog to open its mouth to eat
"
"Anorexia/Weight loss
"
"Eyes may appear sunken due to loss of muscle mass
"
"Most autoimmune diseases start for unknown reasons, but they can be due to parasitic or viral infections, vaccines or other reactions to medications, exposure to environmental toxins or allergens, stress, or an early sign of cancer. The cause of this disease is unknown, but there is an increase in the immunoglobulin G to the fiber protein myosin, a component in muscle. 
"
"Your veterinarian may suspect MMM based on a few test results. A panel of bloodwork may show any of the following:
"
"Anemia, a decrease in red blood cells
"
"An increase in certain white blood cells called neutrophils, leukocytes, and eosinophils
"
"An increase in globulins, which is seen with many diseases that stimulate the immune system
"
"An increase in creatine kinase (CK), a muscle enzyme
"
"An increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), a liver and muscle enzyme
"
"If a tooth or oral condition was initially suspected, your veterinarian may recommend a thorough oral examination under anesthesia. An awake dog may clench its jaw shut as a pain response, but a dog under anesthesia will no longer have muscle control. A dog suspected to have MMM will not be able to have its jaw opened even under anesthesia, and your veterinarian will recommend further testing.
"
"There is a specific blood test that defines circulating autoantibodies to the 2M fibers. It is called a 2M antibody ELISA assay and it can help diagnose masticatory muscle myositis. A muscle biopsy (removal of a sample to examine) is needed, however, to help determine the progression of the disease and subsequent prognosis.
"
"Ideally, this test should be done before treatment is initiated. Steroids are typically the treatment of choice, but it can interfere with the 2M antibody test as steroids decrease the quantity of circulating antibodies in the blood and may result in a false negative. End-stage destruction of muscle fibers may also result in a false negative test because of the severity of fibrous tissue replacing muscle. The muscle biopsy will examine the amount of inflammation and how much fibrous tissue has formed from deteriorating muscle.
"
"In some cases, dogs can spontaneously improve with a regression of the autoantibodies and not require therapy. However, most dogs need a course of therapy that may last weeks to months (in some cases six to eight months) or even lifelong immunosuppressive therapy.
"
"The length of treatment often depends on the severity of the disease and how quickly the disease was diagnosed. The most important aspect of treatment is to treat for a long enough period that the dog does not have a relapse. For this reason, it is important for owners to follow the prescription and administer all the medications prescribed by the veterinarian.
"
"Corticosteroids—at immunosuppressive doses—are often prescribed for at least 30 days before tapering the dose. Some dogs need lifelong medication, and others can stop therapy after a tapering-down dose regimen. Usually, prednisone (or prednisolone) is the drug of choice.
"
"Unfortunately, chronic steroid use will also lead to muscle wasting, like the effects of MMM, and the bones of the head may become prominent.
"
"Other immunosuppressive drugs (such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, or mycophenolate) may be prescribed to help combat the inflammation and can be used in combination with prednisone. The goal is to aggressively halt the immune system’s attack on the muscle and return the dog to normal as quickly as possible, which improves prognosis and prevents permanent damage to the muscles.
"
"Your dog may need other pain medications until the steroids reduce inflammation and circulating antibodies.
"
"It was previously recommended that dogs undergo anesthesia to have the jaw forcibly opened to stretch the fibrous tissue and muscles. However, this process has gone out of favor as it can lead to trauma such as mandibular luxation (dislocation) or fracture, and increases the inflammation in the torn muscles. It also does not help the outcome of the disease.
"
"You can expect any medications prescribed to take a few weeks to work before your dog feels better and shows some improvement. Depending on the degree of improvement, your veterinarian may start to taper medications slowly to prevent relapse. If you are worried about any side effects, please contact your veterinarian to discuss the symptoms.
"
"Successful feeding may require softening dry food with warm water or canned food or blending it into a gruel to lap up or syringe feed, if necessary. There are also calorie-dense liquid formulations that may be prescribed by your vet.
"
"Masticatory myositis can be a recurrent condition, and it can be more difficult to treat each time. The prognosis declines with subsequent episodes of the disease because of fibrous changes to the muscle.
"
"The most common causes of a relapse, or worsening condition with MMM, are inappropriate doses of immunosuppressive medications, or an inappropriate length of time the medications are prescribed or given to the dog. It is very important to give all medications as prescribed and to work closely with your veterinarian.
"
"Masticatory myositis can be fatal as the dog cannot open its mouth to eat or drink properly. If the disease goes untreated or it has progressed to the point that most of the muscle fibers of the jaw have been replaced by fibrous tissue, this disease is not curable. Otherwise, dogs that respond to therapy can be expected to live a normal life with this disease.
"
"Prognosis is usually favorable if dogs are treated aggressively. In a recent study conducted at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, cases of MMM were evaluated over a 17-year period. It showed many dogs improving within a couple of days of therapy, and within four weeks of treatment, dogs typically regained normal chewing function. Approximately 27 percent of affected dogs experienced a relapse and required continued steroid therapy for the condition to be resolved.

"Mast cell tumors in dogs are the most common form of canine skin cancer. Mast cells are white blood cells found throughout the body and are part of the immune system. They are responsible for the allergic response and can release histamine as well as other compounds.
"
"Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary glands in female dogs. It can occur with or without infection. Typically, mastitis occurs postpartum, due to how messy the whelping box can get and/or weening the pups abruptly or too early. There are multiple types of mastitis in dogs.  
"
"Acute Mastitis: Sudden swelling of the mammary gland that includes heat and pain. The milk will be obviously abnormal. This type of mastitis may also cause changes in the mother, such as lethargy.  
"
"Septic Mastitis: Sudden swelling of the mammary gland associated with heat, pain, abnormal milk coloration, and changes in the mother such as lethargy, changes in appetite, fever. Septic mastitis and its symptoms are typically caused by bacteria.  
"
"Chronic or Subclinical Mastitis: Long-term inflammation of mammary tissue accompanied by a lack of obvious clinical signs such as swelling or warmth.  
"
"Vaginal hyperplasia and prolapse refers to a mass which protrudes from the vaginal area. The condition is similar in nature to fluid-filled tissue (edema). If serious, it can prevent normal urination. Vaginal hyperplasia affects dogs of all ages, although it is found more commonly in younger animals. The outcome is positive for most animals, but the chance of the condition recurring is high.
"
"Type 1 hyperplasia occurs when there is a slight protrusion, even though it does not exit the vulva itself. Type 2 hyperplasia, on the other hand, is when the vaginal tissue actually protrudes through the vulvar opening. While Type 3 hyperplasia refers to the donut-shaped mass, which can be seen externally.
"
"There are several signs that may be noticed with this medical disorder, including the licking of the vaginal area, unwillingness to copulate, and painful urination (dysuria).
"
"This disorder can affect almost any breed. But these breeds are more likely to suffer from the condition: Labradors, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, German Shepherds, Springer Spaniels, Walker Hounds, Airedale Terriers, and American Pit Bull Terriers.
"
"Upon physical examination, a round mass may be noticed protruding the animal's vulvar area. A vaginal examination will be performed to determine the severity and type of the condition. To the touch, the animal's tissue may feel dry.
"
"
"
"Treatment is typically done on an outpatient basis. If there is a protruding mass, it is important to keep the area clean and watch for problems urinating, as they are common. The recurrence rate is high; 66-100% of animals will have the medical condition return after treatment.
"
"If the animal is unable to urinate, this is a sign of a serious medical condition and should be treated immediately. The outcome for the animal is positive, but there are complications that can occur when the urethra is involved.
"
"There are no current prevention methods for this medical condition.

"Mast cells become cancerous when they begin dividing abnormally and grow into tumors. Mast cell tumors can be easily mistaken for other skin lesions, like warts or benign lumps.
"
"They can appear in any shape, firmness, size, or location. However, mast cell tumors in dogs are often firm, solitary, slow-growing masses of the skin. In some cases, mast cell tumors can also cause severe allergic (anaphylactic) reactions in dogs. 
"
"Because they are so good at mimicking other skin conditions, it’s usually impossible to identify a mast cell tumor just by looking at it—even for your veterinarian. 
"
"Mast cell tumors are more common on middle-aged dogs, and certain breeds like Boxers and Boston Terriers are more at risk.
"
"Because of this, it’s a good idea to have your vet look at any unusual skin masses that appear on your dog. 
"
"Mast cell tumors in dogs may not cause any symptoms at all. To help prevent more serious disease, vets recommend routinely checking your dog over to look for any masses on the skin. Make an appointment to see your vet if you find:  
"
"A new skin mass 
"
"A known mass that has changed in size, texture, or color 
"
"An unexplained allergic reaction or hives
"
"Some masses may appear small and easily movable in (or just under) the skin with little swelling. More aggressive tumors can appear as larger, hairless sores. 
"
"Often, mast cell tumors will change size. They can go from being very small to very large when they are bumped. When a tumor is bumped or agitated, it may go through a process called degranulation. This means that the tumor releases all its inflammatory material at once. These tumors can even get bigger and smaller over the course of the day, which is unique to this type of tumor.
"
"Some mast cell tumors in dogs will result in body-wide symptoms, including strong allergic reactions. Degranulation can cause symptoms such as swelling and redness in the affected area or a more severe anaphylactic reaction that includes: 
"
"Weakness 
"
"Non-septic Mastitis: Inflammation of the mammary tissues without a cause such as bacteria or fungus.  
"
"Gangrenous Mastitis: The teat, and possibly surrounding tissues, appears black or bruised. The milk may be blood-tinged or bloody. The mother will also be very ill, with symptoms such as vomiting, decreased appetite, fever, changes in blood pressure.

"The symptoms of mastitis vary, depending on the type of mastitis. Affected glands will have milk or fluid that may be described as discolored, bloody, or pus-like in appearance. If they are infected, glands may be described as swollen, warm, firm, discolored, or ulcerated (skin broken open).  
"
"Acute mastitis symptoms may include glands that are hot and painful. This condition may progress to septic mastitis if it’s not treated in time. In septic mastitis, clinical signs include fever, depression, anorexia, lethargy, or mother neglecting puppies.  
"
"The only clinical sign observed with chronic or subclinical mastitis is failure of the pups to thrive. For non-septic mastitis, which commonly occurs at weaning about 3-4 weeks after birth, common signs include swollen glands that are painful to touch, even though the dog is relatively healthy and alert.  
"
"In severe cases of mastitis, the mother will be sick and may show symptoms such as: 
"
"Fever 
"
"Refusal to eat 
"
"Vomiting 
"
"Listlessness 
"
"Rapid heart rate 
"
"Depression 
"
"Severe drop in blood pressure 
"
"Mastitis is most commonly caused by bacteria, such as E. coli, enterococci, staphylococcus, and streptococcus spp. Other causes include: 
"
"Fungus, such as blastomycosis and mycobacterium 
"
"Trauma, such as a wound caused by sharp edges of the whelping box or (rarely) a puppy scratching the teat while nursing 
"
"Damp and unsanitary environment

"Like other types of cancer in dogs, mast cell tumors are likely caused by a mix of genetic and environmental factors. There is a receptor on the surface of mast cells called c-kit. Current research suggests that mast cell tumors are the result of a mutation in this c-kit receptor.
"
"Certain breeds are more likely to get mast cell tumors. These breeds include:  
"
"Boxers 
"
"Pugs
"
"Pit Bull Terrier
"
"Boston Terrier 
"
"Bulldogs
"
"Retriever breeds (such as the Golden Retriever) 
"
"Rhodesian Ridgeback
"
"Bullmastiff
"
"Weimaraner
"
"Schnauzer
"
"Your veterinarian will create a skin chart of all known masses. They will collect cells from the masses to look at under the microscope using a fine needle aspiration (FNA).
"
"Mast cells are usually very easy to identify under the microscope and this is the primary way these tumors are diagnosed. Your vet will likely recommend performing a biopsy on the more concerning masses.
"
"Once a mast cell tumor has been diagnosed, several more tests are recommended to help determine if the cancer has spread.
"
"Your vet may want to do lymph node aspirates to collect cells from the regional lymph nodes to look for spread of the mast cell cancer. X-rays, blood work, and/or an ultrasound of the abdomen may be recommended to look for any evidence that the cancer has spread to the liver or spleen.
"
"Mastitis is typically diagnosed with a physical exam and any information pet parents can provide to a veterinarian. After a physical exam and history have been taken, further diagnostics are done to confirm the severity and type of mastitis so the appropriate course of treatment can be selected. Additional imaging may be done to determine the extent of injury and the critical nature of the condition.  
"
"Blood work such as a CBC and biochemistry may be done to rule out: 
"
"Elevated white blood cell count (WBC), which can indicate a severe case of mastitis 
"
"Platelet abnormalities, which can indicate gangrenous mastitis and sepsis 
"
"Dehydration 
"
"A cytology procedure may be done, which can reveal an increase in white blood cells and either bacteria or fungus (rare). During a cytology study, the vet will examine groups of cells to detect abnormalities.  
"
"A culture of the milk or fluid from the gland may be sent off so the veterinarian will know which medications to prescribe. Radiographs (x-rays) may be done to confirm or rule out gangrenous mastitis. An ultrasound may also be done to determine if there have been any abnormal changes in blood flow or tissue definition. Samples of tissue may be taken and sent to a lab for evaluation (biopsy/histopathology) to confirm mastitis and not cancer.  
"
"Treatment depends on the type and severity of the mastitis. Severe cases require hospitalization along with IV fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics. Surgical therapy may be needed for necrotic (dead) tissue, as this must be drained, flushed, and removed. Antibiotic therapy tends to last for 2-3 weeks. 
"
"Acute mastitis is treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics, and chronic mastitis is treated based on culture and sensitivity results. Because mastitis affects both mom and puppies, mom is started on antibiotics based upon the pH of the milk or fluid expressed from the gland until the culture results from the cytology come back from the lab. It is important to know the age of the puppies and if they are still nursing, as there are some antibiotics that may be harmful to them. 
"
"In addition to oral medication, topical therapy will be needed. If the mother is still nursing, the infected glands are milked by hand every 6 hours until signs of inflammation (e.g., heat, swelling, redness, pain) improve. Prior to milking, warm compresses may be applied to encourage drainage. 
"
"If the gland is minimally painful, a massage may be done to encourage blood flow and help break up congested tissue. Cold laser therapy may be recommended to help reduce pain and inflammation. Cold laser therapy is helpful because it is a noninvasive procedure that uses a specific frequency of light to stimulate tissue healing and improve blood circulation to specific areas such as the skin and mammary tissue.  
"
"Cabbage compresses may also be done to decrease inflammation. Not much is understood about what makes cabbage so helpful, but it is believed that a cabbage compress can be beneficial because it acts as an effective cold compress to relieve mild inflammation. This therapy may be done in the clinic if the mother is hospitalized, or it may be recommended as part of at-home care. After treatment with cabbage compresses, puppies can nurse from affected glands when wraps are removed. 
"
"Continuing to nurse puppies prevents milk stasis and helps with drainage. If the mother is currently taking antibiotics, probiotics may be helpful to the mother and puppies to help maintain gut flora and prevent diarrhea. 
"
"When treating mastitis, there may be cases in which puppies must be weaned early or an alternative source of nutrition provided, including: 
"
"Multiple glands are abscessed 
"
"An antibiotic is needed that is unsafe in neonates 
"
"Mother is systemically ill 
"
"Mother refuses to nurse 
"
"Treatment of mastitis associated with a phantom pregnancy may include antibiotic therapy and cabbage leaf therapy. Phantom pregnancy is also known as pseudopregnancy or false pregnancy. This occurs when a dog displays maternal behavior in combination with the physical signs of heat followed by signs of pregnancy, without being pregnant. This behavior can be observed in an intact female dog and is treated by removing the object (e.g., toy, blanket) that is being “mothered.” 
"
"If a dog is diagnosed with either acute or chronic mastitis, the prognosis is good. Clinical signs should clear up in about 2-3 weeks in response to treatment. If the mastitis is not responsive to treatment or there is gangrenous mastitis associated with septicemia, the prognosis is guarded.  
"
"Mast cell tumors that are more aggressive are likely to spread (metastasize) to other locations outside of the original tumor. 
"
"It’s helpful to know if the tumor has spread before moving forward with choosing the best treatment. Because most mast cell tumors are low- or intermediate- grade and have not spread, some pet parents may elect to go straight to surgery and skip staging.
"
"When your vet removes the tumor, they will want to send it off for histopathology (biopsy). This will allow them to tell if the tumor is completely removed and determine how likely it is to come back or spread.
"
"Grading helps determine the behavior of the tumor. Low grade tumors are less likely to spread or return, while high grade tumors are more likely to metastasize and grow back.
"
"Staging is done to figure out how much the cancer has already spread.
"
"With lower (zero or one) staging, the mast cell tumor has not spread to other locations. Mast cell tumors most commonly metastasize (spread) to the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver.
"
"Higher stages (three or four) correlate with more spread of the cancer to other sites.
"
"Staging can be helpful in determining the course of treatment.
"
"For example, in a tumor that hasn’t spread, you would be more likely to surgically remove it. Compare that to a cancer that has already spread to other locations. This dog would be better helped by chemotherapy or other system-wide treatment.
"
"Fortunately, most mast cell tumors are low to intermediate grade, with high grade aggressive mast cell tumors being much less common. This is good news because most low- and intermediate-grade tumors are less likely to grow back after they’ve been completely surgically removed.
"
"High-grade masses that have spread aggressively to the lymph nodes and internal organs may require more treatment than just surgery. Your vet may recommend consulting with a veterinary oncologist about chemotherapy for additional treatment in these cases.
"
"If surgery is not an option because the tumor is too big to remove, then radiation therapy may be considered.
"
"Recovering from surgical removal of a low-grade mast cell tumor in dogs usually requires two weeks of rest, pain medications, antihistamines like Benadryl®, and wearing a recovery collar. After two weeks, your veterinarian will remove the sutures and your dog can resume normal activity.  
"
"For several months after surgery, it’s important to watch the area where the mass was removed to see if it comes back, although recurrence is unlikely for most low-grade tumors. Surgery in most cases is curative, and dogs usually can live their natural lifespan. 
"
"For high-grade tumors, recovery after surgery will be the same, but your veterinarian will likely suggest pursuing additional treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy to prevent any tumors or cancer cells that have spread from causing more problems.  
"
"Survival time in dogs with high-grade mast cell cancer following radiation or chemotherapy usually ranges from 10 months to two years, depending on the tumor and the therapy.
"
"Without any treatment, the lifespan of dogs diagnosed with high-grade, aggressive mast cell tumors averages about four months. 
"
"Prevention of mast cell tumors in dogs is not something pet parents have any control over since it’s largely something encoded in a dog’s DNA.
"
"The best thing a pet parent can do is catch mast cell tumors early.
"
"Regularly feel your dog's body and monitor them closely for any lumps or bumps. If new masses are found, get your dog into your regular veterinarian for them to collect cells from the mass and rule out mast cell cancer.
"
"Remember, the smaller the mass at the time of diagnosis and surgery, the easier it will be for your vet to remove all of it.
"
"Unfortunately, some mast cell tumors can be aggressive and return again and again.
"
"If your dog is suffering from recurrent mast cell tumors or mast cell cancer that has spread throughout their body, it’s important to monitor their quality of life.
"
"It’s helpful to monitor good days versus bad days. Before bed, think over how the day was for your dog. Are they still eating, playful, and wagging their tail?
"
"Write down whether it was a good day or a bad day. When the bad days outnumber the good days, it is a strong indication that your pet has lost quality of life.
"
"Mast cell tumors are made up of mast cells while histiocytomas are tumors that derive from histiocytes. Both mast cells and histiocytes are types of white blood cells, but mast cell tumors can be much more dangerous than histiocytomas.
"
"Most histiocytomas will go away on their own after a couple months, while mast cell tumors will not spontaneously resolve.
"
"Mast cell tumor surgical removal can range anywhere from $500 to $1,500 with an additional several hundred to a thousand in diagnostics before surgery.
"
"The following steps can help reduce the right of mastitis: 
"
"Trimming puppies’ nails to reduce wounds to the mother that may lead to infection. 
"
"Monitoring neonates to make sure they are nursing from all glands to avoid sudden and prolonged milk statis. If neonates are not nursing from all the glands, it is OK to move them around. 
"
"Keep the area where mom and puppies are kept clean, dry, and free of sharp edges to prevent an environment where bacteria can thrive 
"
"Change bedding in nursing environment at least 1-2 times per day and scrubbing the box daily to reduce bacteria. 
"
"Mastitis must first be diagnosed by a veterinarian so a treatment plan can be put together for the mother and possible affected puppies. Moderate to mild cases may be sent home with a regimen of antibiotics, care modifications, compression therapy, and possibly massage. Treatment should not be done at home without the supervision of a veterinarian, because therapy can include hospitalization, surgical treatment, medication, and/or massage/compression therapy.
"
"Yes, mastitis can be fatal for the mother and/or the puppies if not addressed promptly.

"Hypoandrogenism refers to the relative or absolute deficiency of masculinizing sex hormones, such as testosterone and its by-products. Also known as androgens, these hormones are produced by the adrenal cortex -- part of the adrenal glands, which are located above each kidney -- and the testes in the male, and by the ovaries in the female. There are two subtypes of the condition: primary and secondary.
"
"Primary hypoandrogenism in the male is a rare condition associated with bilaterally symmetric hair loss in older castrated male dogs, especially the Afghan hound. It may be seen in association with testicular destruction in association with inflammatory testicular disease; however, the latter is not usually associated with clinical signs other than a lack of libido and spermatogenesis. Primary hypoandrogenism is also documented in females, but is rare.
"
"Conversely, secondary hypoandrogenism is due to such conditions as hyperadrenocorticism (an endocrine disorder) and hypothyroidism, and is far more common. Although congenital forms exist as well, it is more common in older animals. In some cases, symptoms may begin to appear around puberty in the form of behavioral or anatomic abnormalities.
"
" 
"
" 
"
" 
"
"In addition, Boston terriers are predisposed to hypoandrogenism. The low fetal androgen production is thought to be associated with the occurrence of hypospadias, a birth defect of the urethra in the male.
"
" 
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis as well as a number of other tests to identify the underlying cause such as hypothyroidism.  For example, your doctor will want to know how the thyroid is functioning. The physical exam and the history you provide will also be helpful. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. If there has been hair loss your doctor may also perform a skin biopsy, and a testicular biopsy can be useful for determining whether there is an inflammatory testicular disease.
"
" 
"
"
"
" 
"
"Treatment will depend on the underlying cause, but your veterinarian may attempt hormone replacement therapy to see if it raises the androgen levels.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"If your dog is to be used for breeding, avoid drugs that are known to cause hypoandrogenism (e.g., steroid compounds).
"
" 
"
" 
"
"Your veterinarian will ask you to keep track of any responses you see to the prescribed therapy, and will schedule follow up visits in order to conduct periodic tests to look for clinical signs that the treatment plan is working.

"Magnesium is second only to potassium as the most abundant substance in the cells. Therefore, a deficiency in magnesium (also known as hypomagnesemia) is a serious health concern. Most magnesium is found in bone (60 percent) and soft tissue (38 percent), and most of the soft tissue magnesium resides in the skeletal muscle and liver. It is required for many metabolic functions, and its role as an activator or catalyst for more than 300 enzyme systems includes formation of the enzymes that involve ATP (adenose triphosphate), which transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism.
"
"Magnesium is an important cofactor in maintaining an electrical balance across membranes. It is also important in the production and elimination of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter). A low concentration of magnesium in the extracellular fluid (fluid outside the cell) can increase concentrations of acetylcholine at the motor endplates and cause  an involuntary reaction of muscles. Interference with the electrical gradient can result in neuromuscular and heart abnormalities. Magnesium also regulates calcium movement into smooth muscle cells, and is important to contractile strength (the muscle's capability to contract) and to the stability of the surface vessels of the body.
"
"Some of the complications that can occur with hypomagnesemia are alterations of the functions of the skeletal muscles, resulting in tetany (severe muscular pain) and a variety of myopathies (diseases of skeletal muscles); ventricular heart arrhythmias, or torsades de pointes (a tachycardia, or fast heart rhythm that originates in one of the ventricles of the heart), and depolarization of cardiac cells and tachyarrhythmias (fast heart rhythms); resistance to the effects of parathyroid syndrome; an increase in the uptake of calcium into bone; and an increase in the risk of digoxin (digitalis) toxicity.
"
"  
"
"Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. Signs of hypomagnesemia are typically vague and affect one or more body systems. Therefore, other causes of neuromuscular abnormalities, and especially other electrolyte abnormalities, must be investigated. During the physical examination, your doctor will be looking for cardiac abnormalities, intoxications related to drugs/medications, and kidney diseases, any of which can lead to some of the symptoms described above.
"
"An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat), a common side effect of hypomagnesemia.
"
"

"Female dogs have five pairs of mammary glands on their abdomen, usually starting just below the armpits and running down toward the groin area. The function of the mammary glands is to provide milk and nutrients to the dog’s offspring.  
"
"While most dogs are typically spayed during their puppy years, many dogs who are not spayed at a young age will go on to have litters during their lifetime. Female dogs that have had previous litters will often exhibit prominent mammary glands that can be visible or felt by touch.   
"
"Only about half of mammary tumors in dogs are malignant (cancerous).  
"
"These types of mammary tumors include:  
"
"Benign adenomas (nonmalignant) 
"
"Mammary carcinomas (malignant)  
"
"Mammary sarcomas (malignant) 
"
"Mixed mammary tumors (can be nonmalignant or malignant)  
"
"Inflammatory carcinoma (highly malignant and more aggressive) 
"
"It’s important to check your dog’s mammary glands at routine exams with a veterinarian. 
"
"Mange is a skin disease caused by mites found at the hair follicles. It is caused by two different types of mites and can be contagious and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans).  
"
"The two types of mange include sarcoptic mange and demodectic mange. 
"
"Sarcoptic mange, which is also known as scabies, is caused by Sarcoptes scabiei. This type of mange is less common than demodectic mange, and typically affects homeless dogs, who are suffering and neglected. It is also more common in dogs with compromised immune systems.  
"
"Demodectic mange, or red mange, is caused by Demodex canis, Demodex injai, or Demodex cornei. This type of mange is transmitted between a mother and puppy during the feeding process. It is not contagious between other dogs and is not contagious to humans.  
"

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Clinical signs of mange include: 
"
"Severe itching 
"
"Alopecia (hair loss) 
"
"Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the abnormality and the severity of the hypomagnesemia. Because severe hypomagnesemia can be fatal, prompt and appropriate treatment is essential. Mild hypomagnesemia may resolve with treatment of the underlying disorder; however, if hypomagnesemia is severe, intensive care will be needed.
"
"If digoxin is being prescribed, its use will have to be discontinued, if possible, until the hypomagnesemia has been resolved, and diuretics will need to be used with caution, or another form of fluid removal prescribed. In addition, it must be kept in mind that hpermagnesemia – too much magnesium in the body – is possible with overzealous treatment.
"
"Initially, your veterinarian will want to check your dog's magnesium and calcium concentrations on a daily basis. During magnesium infusions, your doctor will also want to administer an ECG continuously to make sure that your dog's heart is staying within its normal rhythm.

"A female dog’s mammary glands should be soft and pliable; and there shouldn’t be any lumps or firm swellings. If you happen to notice a lump, have your dog examined by a veterinarian immediately.  
"
"Sometimes, dogs with mammary tumors can experience a variety of other symptoms, such as: 
"
"Tenderness, warmth, or pain at the location of the tumor  
"
"Lethargy  
"
"Decreased appetite and weight loss  
"
"Weakness  
"
"Coughing  
"
"Mammary tumors are common, especially in unspayed female dogs, as hormones like estrogen and progesterone play a role in both mammary development and cancer formation. The exact cause, however, is unknown at this time.  
"
"Mammary tumors are less common in dogs that are spayed. The likelihood of a dog spayed prior to her first heat cycle developing a mammary tumor is about 0%. If that same dog were spayed after her first heat cycle, the chance of mammary tumor development would rise to 8%. If the same dog went through two or more heat cycles, she would have about a 25% chance of developing a mammary tumor. 
"
"Even though only about half of these tumors are cancerous, any tumor should be taken seriously and tested for further diagnosis.  
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a physical exam in which the mammary mass can easily be palpated (touched). Often, but not always, benign tumors feel like small, well-defined, firm masses, while malignant tumors feel stuck to underlying tissues, are not easily moveable, and have indistinct borders.  
"
"Your veterinarian may also want to perform some basic blood work along with a fine needle aspirate. In this test, a needle is inserted into the mass and cells are collected and sent to a lab for analysis. This test is often performed in a hospital on an outpatient basis and does have some limitations. Your veterinarian may also want to do a biopsy (removal of skin/mass tissue) to send out for further diagnosis.  
"
"Chest radiographs and an abdominal ultrasound may be recommended as follow-ups if the results show cancer, since most mammary tumors spread, or metastasize, to the local lymph nodes, chest, and possibly the liver.  
"
"Tumors that are large, have spread to other organs, are ulcerated (skin broken open), have a history of growing rapidly, or are attached to deeper tissues (i.e., the muscle layer) unfortunately carry a poor prognosis. Average survival times range from several months to several years.  
"
"Mammary gland tumors in dogs typically requires surgery. Chemotherapy and radiation can be used if the tumor is too large, has been incompletely removed through surgery, or has already metastasized, but surgical removal of the tumor is usually the treatment of choice.   
"
"Tumors that are not cancerous can most likely be left alone (unless cosmetically concerning or bother the dog) but should continue to be monitored for any changes in size or consistency.
"
"There are five types of surgeries for mammary gland tumors in dogs:  
"
"Lumpectomy: removal of the mass  
"
"Simple mastectomy: removal of the mass and associated gland 
"
"Regional mastectomy: removal of the mass, the associated gland, and nearby glands and lymph nodes 
"
"Radical or unilateral mastectomy: removal of the entire mammary chain (radical or unilateral mastectomy)  
"
"Bilateral mastectomy: removal of both mammary chains (bilateral mastectomy)   
"
"The best preventative care for mammary gland tumors in dogs is to ensure your dog is spayed, especially at a young age. If you adopt a dog who has had litters in the past, or an unknown history, it’s important to have a conversation with your veterinarian to determine spay options in order to limit any further mammary gland issues.  
"
"For mammary gland tumors that are diagnosed and surgically removed, your veterinarian will most likely recommend follow-up appointments to check in on your dog’s recovery. 
"
"Excoriations (self-inflicted superficial or deep wounds) 
"
" Raised bumps (papules) most commonly on the chest.  
"
"Thick crusted skin typically found on the margins of the ears, the ankles (hocks), armpits, and elbows 
"
"Often, secondary skin infections occur because of the skin lesions. Weight loss, depression, decreased appetite, and lethargy can be caused by the severe itching and uncomfortable skin issues. Enlarged lymph nodes may be found too. A subtype of scabies called Norwegian scabies is characterized by severe skin crusting and is thought to be worsened by a compromised immune system. 
"
"Sarcoptic mites are often transmitted through close contact between dogs. This type of mite does not survive for long periods of time in the environment and needs a host to continue its life cycle. Scabies is not a direct cause of bad hygiene, but it can worsen through neglect or immunosuppression.   
"
"Demodectic mites normally live on the skin of a dog and benefit from the host, without causing harm. Typically, this mite is only passed between dogs when they are puppies and is most often passed from mother to puppy. This mite becomes mange when the mite overgrows the hair follicle. 
"
"Mange is typically diagnosed through a skin scrap test, a hair sample, or cytology.  
"
"The use of a scalpel blade is non-invasive and allows the vet to scrap the skim deep enough for some irritation but allows for a removal of the hair follicle at the root. It’s important for the entire hair follicle to be removed, since demodex is often buried deep in the root. 
"
"Other common tests that a vet may recommend include fecal testing, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, or in some severe cases, a skin biopsy.
"
"Treatment of mange includes topical medications, shampoos, and often antiparasitic medications. Sometimes antibiotics are warranted. Treatment is tailored for the different types of mange and the severity of the infection. A recovery cone or recovery suit may also be recommended during treatment and recovery. 
"
"For scabies, any dog that has come into contact with the infected dog must be treated and the environment they live in, disinfected. This includes kennels, crates, collars, bedding, toys, etc. It’s important for dogs in the environment to remain on monthly or tri-monthly preventatives to avoid infection. 
"
"Demodectic mange does not require environmental cleaning as it does not often transmit between dogs, though a monthly or tri-monthly miticidal preventative is still recommended.  
"
"Most dogs with mange can expect a full recovery with appropriate therapy. For chronic cases, it’s typically due to an underlying systemic illness or secondary infections. Mange is fatal when dogs receive the wrong therapy, or their underlying medical conditions are not managed correctly.
"
"Humans can get sarcoptic mange from dogs but cannot get demodectic mange from dogs.
"
"Mange should not be treated at home if the clinical signs are moderate to severe. If your dog has a small patch of hair loss that she is not bothered by, you may wait 1-2 months to see if there is resolution. If the hair loss persists past this time; skin lesions are noted; or your dog is itchy, becomes lethargic, stops eating, or seems depressed, it is important to bring her to a veterinarian for assessment.
"
"The early signs of mange include alopecia (hair loss); scaling or crusting of the skin; papules or bumps on the skin; mild, moderate, or severe itching; and self-induced excoriations (wounds).

"The average survival time for dogs diagnosed with a malignant mammary tumor is variable, depending on the type (sarcoma vs. carcinoma), stage, spread of the tumor, degree of invasiveness, and grade. It can range from 1 month to almost 2 years but depends on the dog’s diagnosis.
"
"These tumors are generally removed with surgery. Other therapy options such as chemotherapy and radiation can also be used, but typically mammary tumors need to be surgically removed.
"
"Most mammary tumors in dogs often look like a ball of varying size protruding from the skin on the abdomen. Additionally, mammary tumors can feel like small, well-defined, firm masses on, near, or around the gland itself. Some can feel as if they are attached to structures deeper than the skin and are not easily moveable, and their borders are usually indistinct.
"
"Mammary tumors in dogs can often be painful and uncomfortable, which is one of the reasons to have your dog examined. Your veterinarian may want to diagnose and treat her and may prescribe pain medication.
"
"Depending on the type of surgery performed—from a simple lumpectomy to a more aggressive and involved bilateral mastectomy—you could expect to spend anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to more than a thousand.

"The pseudorabies virus infection is an uncommon but highly fatal disease found in dogs, especially those that come into contact with swine. Unfortunately, many dogs with this virus die suddenly, often without characteristic signs.
"
"When symptoms do occur, they include excessive salivation, intense itching, and neurologic behavioral changes. Because of the extreme itching it causes, pseudorabies is sometimes referred to as “mad itch.”
"
"The virus infects both dogs and cats -- primarily those living on farms -- as well as other domestic animals such as swine, cattle, sheep, and goats. Otherwise, there is no breed, gender, or age predilection for this viral infection.
"
"If you would like to learn more about how this pseudorabies affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"As previously stated, it is possible a dog suffering from pseudorabies displays no symptoms at all. However, some signs which may be seen include:
"
"Other symptoms and signs may be neurological in nature, such as:
"
"Other than direct contact with swine, dogs may contract the pseudorabies virus (or Suid herpesvirus 1) by eating contaminated, uncooked meat or offal from swine, or by ingesting infected rats.
"
"Your veterinarian will make a diagnosis of the pseudorabies virus infection by comparing it to diseases with similar symptoms. For example, dogs with the regular form of rabies will attack anything that moves, and there is no itching or sudden death. Meanwhile, a dog that has been poisoned displays no signs of itching or personality change. With canine distemper, there is no hypersalivation, sudden death, or personality change, but respiratory and gastrointestinal signs are common.
"
"If your dog does recover from this infection, a blood test will reveal pseudorabies virus antibodies. If sudden death should occur, your veterinarian will examine its brain tissue for confirmation of pseudorabies.
"
" 
"
"Unfortunately, there is currently no effective medical or medicinal treatment for the pseudorabies virus.
"
"Expected course and prognosis:
"
"There is a mild potential for human infection. Precautions should be taken when treating infected animals, and when handling infected tissues and fluids. Dog-to-dog transmission does not usually occur.

"Lymphoma, also known as lymphosarcoma (LSA), is one of the most common cancers in dogs. LSA occurs due to an overgrowth and unregulated cellular division of lymphocytes, a type of cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system that helps protect the body from infection.
"
"Although LSA can affect any organ of the body, it primarily affects parts of the immune system, including the lymphatic system, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. The lymphatic system is interconnected with the bloodstream, which is why LSA is considered a systemic disease and, as such, requires systemic treatment such as chemotherapy.
"
"There are several types of LSA in dogs, categorized by the organs affected. The most common are:
"
"Multicentric Lymphoma: first noted in the lymph nodes
"
"Gastrointestinal Lymphoma: affecting the stomach and intestines
"
"Cutaneous Lymphoma: lymphoma of the skin
"
"Less common types of lymphoma in dogs include:
"
"Inflammation of the lymph nodes, a condition known as lymphadenitis, is characterized by inflammation of the nodes due to an active migration of white blood cells. There are different types of white blood cells that can cause this: neutrophils, the most abundant type of white blood cells in the body; macrophages, the cells that engulf and digest cellular debris and pathogens in the bloodstream; or eosinophils, the white blood cells of the immune system.
"
"Because of the filtration functions of the lymph nodes, they are likely to be exposed to infectious agents. Lymphadenitis is usually the result of an infectious agent gaining access to a lymph node and establishing an infection, with a resulting response by the immune system to fight the infection with increased white blood cell production. Such infectious agents include fungi and mycobacteria (pathogens known to cause serious diseases in mammals) .
"
"There is no known genetic basis to lymphadenitis, except for rare cases of immunodeficiency; e.g., the familial susceptibility of certain basset hounds to mycobacteriosis (mycobacteria are widespread in the natural world, particularly in aquatic environments), of which lymphadenitis is a frequent manifestation. However, newborn puppies may have a higher rate of occurrence than older dogs, since their still undeveloped immune systems make them more susceptible to infection.
"
"Lymphadenitis seldom causes lymph node enlargement that is severe enough for someone unfamiliar with veterinary medicine to observe. Your dog's doctor, however, will be able to locate the firm nodes through palpation, which is often painful for the animal. The dog may also have a fever, suffer from inappetance (anorexia), or display other systemic signs of infection. Bacterial infections, in particular, may develop abscesses within the nodes, which may open to the exterior and present as draining tracts. Other complications will depend on the location of the infection and whether it is affecting surrounding organs.

"Risk Factors
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will need to ascertain that a palpable or visible mass is actually a lymph node and not a tumor or another kind of inflammation. Also, it may be difficult to distinguish on the basis of clinical findings from other causes of lymph gland enlargement, or a proliferation of cells in the lymph nodes for some other reason, such as cancer.
"
"To be certain of making the correct diagnosis, your veterinarian will order a complete blood count and urinalysis to look for evidence of bacterial and fungal diseases. If the swollen nodes are in the chest and abdomen, diagnostic testing will include X-ray and ultrasound imaging to make a determination. A fine-needle aspiration of the lymph nodes themselves may also be performed to gather sample of the fluid and tissue that is within the nodes, so that the exact internal composition of the lymph nodes can be analyzed.
"
"
"
"Because lymphadenitis is a lesion rather than a specific disease, no single set of therapeutic recommendations is appropriate. The characteristics of the inflammation and the causative agent will dictate appropriate treatment. Your veterinarian will plan the treatment based on the evidence that has been collected, and will prescribe a course of treatment following that. Antibiotics may be prescribed; however, the choice of medications will be based on the findings.
"
"You will need to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for treatment. Follow-up exams will need to be scheduled to make sure that all of the infection has been eliminated. Some of the organisms that cause lymphadenitis are zoonotic (can be communicated to humans and other species). If this is the case, your veterinarian will go over home treatment guidelines with you so that you can protect yourself, your family and other pets from being infected.
"
"Extranodal Lymphoma: an uncommon form that occurs when lymphoma develops in an organ outside the lymphatic system, such as an eye or kidney
"
"Mediastinal Lymphoma: also uncommon, but occurs when lymphoma affects the lymphoid organs within the chest cavity, such as the thymus
"
"The most common symptom of LSA in dogs is an enlarged, firm, non-painful lymph node. Dogs have multiple pairs of lymph nodes throughout the body, but the easiest lymph nodes to locate and feel are the prescapular (front of chest), submandibular (under the jaw), and popliteal (behind the knees). Usually one, both, or multiple nodes are enlarged.
"
"Dogs with LSA may also experience:
"
"Weight loss
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Swelling of the face or limbs
"
"Increased thirst and urination
"
"Symptoms specific to the body area affected can also include dry, crusty skin with patches of hair loss, loss of color, and ulcerated skin (cutaneous LSA); diarrhea and vomiting (gastrointestinal LSA); and exercise intolerance, coughing, and trouble breathing (mediastinal LSA).
"
"Cancer often occurs for reasons that are not well understood. Multiple factors that have been associated with certain cancers include:
"
"Age
"
"UV damage or other environmental triggers
"
"Certain viruses and infections
"
"DNA mutations
"
"Genetics
"
"There is rarely a single cause for cancer, and the development of lymphoma is no different.
"
"In most cases, the first sign of LSA is enlarged lymph nodes. From there, your veterinarian may want to perform a cytology (when a needle is inserted into the node and cells are obtained) or biopsy (a larger needle is inserted into the node for cell collection or to obtain a chunk of tissue) of the lymph node and have the sample reviewed by a pathologist.
"
"Once your dog is diagnosed, your veterinarian may recommend additional tests or refer you to an oncologist for further testing and treatment, including staging—to determine how far the cancer has spread. This may include chest x-rays, abdominal ultrasound, bloodwork, bone marrow aspirates, and IHC (immunohistochemistry) or flow cytometry, which helps determine the type of lymphoma.
"
"LSA in dogs can be classified into five stages depending on the number of body systems affected:
"
"Stage I: Single lymph node affected
"
"Stage II: Multiple lymph nodes affected in a similar region
"
"Stage III: All lymph nodes affected
"
"Stage IV: All lymph nodes affected and organ involvement (spleen, liver, chest)
"
"Stage V: Bone marrow involvement
"
"Lymphoma is one of the cancers that is most responsive to chemotherapy, and remission can often be achieved in well over 50% of dogs. Dogs tolerate chemotherapy much better than people do, and the doses prescribed are often lower, with fewer side effects than expected because the goal of treatment is to preserve the quality of your dog’s life for as long as possible. Some side effects can occur, such as:
"

"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Lethargy
"
"Mild vomiting and diarrhea
"
"Serious side effects, such as bone marrow suppression and secondary infections, can occur, but are not as common. Dogs, with few exceptions, do not lose their hair.
"
"An oncologist can help decide the best medication or medications for your dog. There are multiple chemotherapeutic drugs used in the treatment of LSA, including:
"
"Lomustine
"
"Vincristine
"
"Prednisone
"
"Cyclophosphamide
"
"Chlorambucil
"
"L-Asparaginase
"
"In some cases, your veterinarian may recommend removal of a lymph node or organ affected by LSA. If chemotherapy is not an option, speak with your veterinarian about the use of steroids alone. Although not a first line of treatment, prednisone can improve clinical signs and increase the comfort of your pet, if only for a few weeks.
"
"Despite the most aggressive of treatments, LSA cannot be cured, and most dogs will relapse at some point. A second remission, though more difficult, can be achieved for some dogs. Humane euthanasia may be recommended when the cancer and its effects can no longer be controlled.
"
"Although LSA can be treated and go into remission, the regression of cancer, it cannot be entirely cured. You can expect the cancer to return, and another round of chemotherapy—often a different protocol than previously given—will be needed to achieve remission, which can be quite difficult. The vet should continue to examine your dog frequently for signs of relapse (often seen with enlarged lymph nodes), and it’s important to follow recommendations for recheck exams and follow-up testing.
"
"Additionally, remember that quality of life instead of quantity is the goal for your dog with LSA. The side effects and treatments are often not as severe as what is seen in human medicine, and dogs can maintain a normal, happy and positive life throughout treatment and follow-ups.
"
"Unfortunately, lymphoma is not preventable, but routine checkups and at-home vigilance are key to early diagnosis and treatment.
"
"The life expectancy of dogs with lymphoma varies. Without treatment, the mean survival time is 4–6 weeks. Approximately 50% of dogs will survive beyond this time frame and approximately 50% will die prior to it. For dogs that do undergo chemotherapy, the mean survival time is about a year.

"Lyme disease, also called borreliosis, is a bacterial infection in dogs that is spread by tick bites. Although Lyme disease can also affect people, dogs don’t spread the infection to their pet parents. Lyme disease in dogs can cause serious complications, such as joint inflammation (swelling) and kidney failure.
"
"When a tick bites a dog, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) passes from the tick’s saliva to the dog’s bloodstream, where they can infect the joints, heart, brain, and spinal cord.
"
"Some infected dogs may show no obvious symptoms, while others may become very sick. This largely depends on how strong the dog’s immune system is and how long the infection is present before treatment begins.
"
"Dogs who do outdoor activities—such as hiking or hunting in wooded areas—are at greater risk for Lyme disease because of their increased exposure to ticks.
"
"Dogs and puppies who are unvaccinated and those who are not kept up to date on tick preventatives are also most vulnerable to infection. It’s estimated that between 1.4% and 13.3% of dogs in the United States test positive for Lyme disease.
"
"Although Lyme disease can be found in most states, it is most common in the Midwest, Northeast, Southeast, and West. Cases are most likely to be diagnosed during spring, summer, and fall, when the weather is warmer and ticks are more prevalent.
"
"Dogs with Lyme disease generally live normal lifespans if treatment is started early.
"
"If left untreated, Lyme disease in dogs can cause kidney failure, which is life-threatening. For this reason, dogs having symptoms of Lyme disease should be treated as medical emergencies. If you suspect your dog has Lyme disease, take them to the veterinarian immediately.
"
"Symptoms of Lyme disease in dogs may not occur if a dog’s immune system is able to control the infection. If a pup does develop symptoms, pet parents may notice the following:
"
"Joint pain or swelling
"
"Lameness
"
"High fever
"
"Lethargy
"
"Weakness
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Increased thirst
"
"Increased urination
"
"Weight loss
"
"Swollen legs or belly
"
"Lyme disease in dogs is caused by an infected tick, specifically from the Ixodes genus.
"
"I. scapularis (deer tick) and I. pacificus (western blacklegged tick) are the two main ticks that spread Borrelia burgdorferi.
"
"Ticks become infected with B. burgdorferi by feeding on rodents and birds. The bacteria multiply within the tick and are spread to a dog when the tick bites it.
"
"To pass on the infection, the tick must be attached to the dog for at least 24 to 48 hours.
"
"To diagnose Lyme disease in dogs, veterinarians will use a combination of tests and a discussion with the pet parent. Your vet will want to know about any recent travel history, any recent exposure to ticks, and any symptoms the dog has.
"
"Diagnostic tests that may be done to identify Lyme disease in dogs include:
"
"SNAP 4Dx—A few drops of blood are taken from a dog’s vein, mixed with a special solution, and then used to test for antibodies. Results are available in just eight minutes, and vaccination against Lyme disease does not affect the results.
"
"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)—This test uses blood, joint fluid, or a lymph node sample to test for Lyme disease.
"
"Blood work—Blood can be collected from a dog’s vein to check overall health and rule out other underlying conditions that may look like Lyme disease.
"
"Urinalysis—A sample of urine is taken to check for signs of protein, which can be a sign of kidney disease in dogs who have tested positive for Lyme disease.
"
"Lyme disease in dogs is most often treated using an antibiotic called doxycycline. It’s given to a pup for at least 30 days. Dogs are expected to show improvement in their symptoms in as little as 24 hours. Other antibiotics—amoxicillin and cefovecin—can be used if dogs are sensitive to doxycycline.
"
"Pain medications, such as gabapentin, may be given if there is joint swelling or discomfort. Steroids and other immunosuppressant medications may be used in some cases if considered helpful by the veterinarian. 
"
"Dogs with severe disease may need hospitalization for supportive care, including intravenous (IV) fluids and medications to support the kidneys.
"
"After starting antibiotic treatment, most dogs start feeling better within one to two days. Lyme disease in dogs must be treated for at least 30 days to get rid of the bacterial infection. With early diagnosis and treatment, most cases of Lyme disease in dogs are curable.
"
"However, some dogs may have lasting lameness if the dog was chronically infected or treatment was delayed. These dogs may need a longer course of antibiotics as well as other medications—such as pain management—for the rest of their lives. Providing an orthopedic dog bed can help these dogs feel more comfortable. Portable stairs can also help dogs get on and off sofas and chairs, preventing jumps on and off and further joint irritation.
"
"If the infection has reached the kidneys, it’s very difficult to cure Lyme disease, and dogs typically need long-term medical management. These dogs have a poor prognosis. If a dog’s quality of life has significantly decreased, the veterinarian may recommend humane euthanasia to relieve suffering.
"
"There are two main ways to prevent Lyme disease in dogs—vaccination and tick preventatives.
"
"The Lyme vaccine is given to puppies at 12 weeks of age, followed by a booster three weeks later. It’s then given yearly while a dog is considered at risk. Dogs who live in or travel to areas of the country where Lyme disease is prevalent should get the vaccine.
"
"Topical or oral products that prevent and kill ticks are important in protecting dogs against tick bites and Lyme disease. Products that may be recommended by your veterinarian include Bravecto®, NexGard®, and Simparica Trio™. Dogs should be kept on tick preventatives year-round for the best protection.
"
"Other important preventative measures pet parents can take include checking dogs for ticks, immediately removing any you find from your dog, and keeping dogs out of heavily wooded areas where tick populations are high.
"
"If your dog tests positive for Lyme disease, your veterinarian will develop a proper treatment plan.
"
"For mildly symptomatic dogs who test positive, a monthlong course of antibiotics is recommended. In dogs with severe disease, hospitalization and supportive care may be needed.
"
"No. Lyme disease in dogs is not contagious between dogs or from dogs to humans.

"The lymphatic vessels are vascular channels (similar to veins) that transport lymph, a clear to slightly colored fluid that contains white-blood cells. This fluid circulates through the lymphatic vessels, removing bacteria and other materials from body tissues. It also serves to transport fat from the small intestines, eventually emptying into the blood, returning tissue fluids into the general body circulation.
"
"Lymphangiectasia is the dilation (expansion) of the lymphatic vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which includes the stomach, small intestines, and large intestines. Lymphangiectasia is an obstructive disorder of the lymphatic system of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in the loss of body proteins through the intestines.
"
"A familial tendency for this condition has been reported for soft-coated wheaten terriers, basenjis, Norwegian lundehunds, and Yorkshire terriers. Dogs of any age can be affected, but it is most common in middle-aged dogs. No age or gender has been reported to be more likely to develop in any breed, with the exception of soft-coated wheaten terriers, which have shown an increased likelihood of lymphangiectasia in females as compared to males.
"
"Primary or congenital lymphangiectasia
"
"Secondary lymphangiectasia
"
"The major clinical symptom of lymphangiectasia is the loss of protein. However, there are several diseased conditions that can also account for that, so your veterinarian will need to rule them out before arriving at a diagnosis of lymphangiectasia.
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Because this is a disease of the intestines, a fecal smear and flotation will be done to rule out intestinal parasites. A culture of the fecal smear will also help your doctor to determine if there are infectious agents present, if that is suspected that as a cause. X-rays of the chest and abdomen can be used to rule out cardiac disease and cancer, and abdominal ultrasound may be used to rule out congestive heart failure.
"
"If necessary, your veterinarian may also conduct an endoscopy. This method uses a tubular device that is equipped with a small camera for viewing the internal structures of the body, and a tool that is capable of collecting tissue and fluid samples for biopsy. Your veterinarian can use the endoscope in this instance to examine the gastrointestinal tract and to take a sample of mucus. Another possible diagnostic tool, if your doctor needs more information about the functioning of the heart, will be an electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording, which can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat).
"
"
"
"Depending on the final diagnosis, your dog will probably be treated as an outpatient. Only if there are complications severe enough to require treatment in a hospital setting will your veterinarian recommend inpatient care. A low-fat diet with high-quality protein will need to be put in place, and your veterinarian may also prescribe supplements to increase fat and calorie intake.
"
"Surgical intervention is rare. However, if there is a lymphatic blockage, your veterinarian may recommend surgery to remove the cause of the blockage. Also, if the sac around the heart is inflamed and thickened, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair the sac.
"
"Prescribed medications may include steroids to reduce inflammation, and antibiotics, to either treat an underlying infection or to prevent an opportunistic infection from taking hold during the course of treatment.
"
"You will need to monitor your dog's body weight, and your veterinarian will set up a schedule to see the dog from time to time to test for protein levels and to observe recurrent clinical signs, such as fluid build-up. The severity of the disease will determine how often you will need to take your dog back for follow-up treatments.
"
"The long-term prognosis for lymphangiectasia is guarded. Some dogs fail to respond to treatment. However, remissions of several months to more than two years can be achieved in some patients, but this can be entirely dependent on any underlying conditions, and the severity of the disease itself.

"Lungworms in dogs consist of multiple species of worm parasites that can infect the airways and lung tissue of domestic and wild dogs. Species of lungworms in dogs include roundworm (nematode) and fluke (trematode). 
"
"Roundworms are not specific to any geographical location, whereas the fluke lungworms are more common in some environments. 
"
"For example, the lung fluke Paragonimus kellicotti is found in the Great Lakes region, Midwest, and Southern United States. This is because the fluke lungworm relies on specific species of snail and crayfish found in these regions as intermediate hosts for part of their life cycle.
"
"Signs of lungworms in dogs can include:
"
"Non-productive cough (produces no mucus)
"
"Rapid respiratory rate
"
"Exercise intolerance (becoming out of breath more easily, not able to play as hard/long as usual)
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Dogs can also have a subclinical lungworm infection, which means they show no signs.
"
"A dog becomes infected with lungworms by eating lungworm larvae. 
"
"Larvae may also be passed from a mother to her puppies through grooming and nursing. The immature larvae enter the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the circulation system (blood or lymphatic), and are transported to the heart and lungs. 
"
"Depending on the species of lungworm, the larvae can develop into adult worms in as little as 5 weeks after being ingested by a dog. However, in other lungworm species, maturation into adult worms can take up to 21 weeks. 
"
"A luxating patella in dogs is a common condition in which the kneecap (patella) shifts sideways, or luxates, away from the normal position at the front of the knee. You may also refer to it as a dislocated kneecap.
"
"About 75% of the time, a luxating patella in dogs tends to occur inward, or toward the other hind limb. This version of a luxating patella is called medial patellar luxation (MPL) and is more common in smaller dogs.
"
"Sometimes the shift occurs outward, or away from the other leg. This condition is known as a lateral patellar luxation (LPL) and is more commonly seen in larger dogs, although MPL is still more common overall.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The main symptom of a luxating patella in dogs that is not commonly seen with other conditions is the sudden lifting of one hind limb. Some dogs will yelp when this occurs, but others will show no signs of discomfort.
"
"In this brief, sudden limp, a dog will hold their hindlimb off the ground for a short period of time before walking normally again. The affected leg may be held close to the body or extended backwards. This is often termed a “skip” by owners and vets alike.
"
"The following symptoms of patellar luxation, however, can also be seen in other orthopedic conditions:
"
"Limp that comes and goes
"
"Systemic lupus erythematosus, known as SLE or lupus, is a multi-systemic immune-mediated disease in dogs where multiple organs are affected.
"
"An immune-mediated disease happens when the immune system­—the system in charge of protecting the body and fighting off foreign substances (antigens), such as bacteria or viruses—becomes unbalanced and uncontrollable.
"
"Instead of targeting foreign antigens, the immune system develops antibodies against its own proteins to form immune complexes.
"
"When a dog has SLE, their body develops antibodies targeted against:
"
"These immune complexes can then become lodged in a pup’s tissues, creating more inflammation (swelling), which worsens their condition.
"
"Symptoms shown by your dog will depend on the location of their immune complexes.
"
"While lupus is not considered a true medical emergency, it has potentially fatal complications.
"
"Female adult lungworms start depositing eggs that then hatch into first-stage larvae within the airways. These eggs and first-stage larvae are then coughed up and spit out or vomited. Any dogs that have contact with the infected dog’s spit or vomit can contract lungworms.
"
"If the dog that coughed them up then swallows their own spit or vomit, the lungworm eggs and larvae travel through the dog’s GI tract. The dog sheds them in their feces, where they can infect other dogs that come into contact with the poop. 
"
"Your veterinarian will likely recommend chest x-rays if your pet has a history of respiratory concerns. They will also take a fecal sample and may recommend an airway wash if they can’t confirm the diagnosis.
"
"On x-rays of dogs with lungworms, the vet might see small spots of inflammation within the lung tissue, or larger areas of inflammation with possible pneumonia. If the lung is damaged severely enough, it can break open and cause air to leak into the dog’s chest. This is called a pneumothorax. 
"
"One species of lungworm can produce thickening of the large trachea wall (windpipe) and/or trachea nodules (abnormal trachea growths), which your vet may be able to see on the x-rays.
"
"X-rays alone cannot be used to diagnose lungworms in dogs, as other diseases can cause similar effects. However, your vet may have a suspicion of lungworm based on your geographical location and/or a history of recent travel with your dog.
"
"Your vet will use fecal tests to look for lungworm eggs and larvae. They may have you bring multiple fecal samples from different days because the shedding of lungworm eggs and larvae in the feces comes and goes.
"
"If your vet can’t diagnose lungworms with x-rays and fecal testing, they may recommend an airway wash such as a transtracheal wash (TTW) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), both of which are performed under anesthesia. 
"
"The fluid obtained from your dog’s airways and lungs during the wash procedure may contain the lungworm larvae, eggs, and inflammatory cells that will lead to a diagnosis. 
"
"Treatment to get rid of lungworms in dogs involves a dewormer that’s usually administered orally for 14 days.
"
"Your dog’s immune system will generate inflammation as a reaction to the dead worms and larvae, so your veterinarian may also prescribe a corticosteroid anti-inflammatory medication. 
"
"It is common for a dog to seem to get worse when first starting treatment, since this is the period when there will be the largest number of dead and/or dying worms. 
"
"If you are concerned with how your dog is doing or have any questions, call your veterinarian in case additional treatment is needed. 
"
"In more complicated lungworm cases, cysts can form in the lung tissue. If the cysts rupture, your dog can accumulate air that’s in the chest and outside the lung (pneumothorax). 
"
"If enough air accumulates to cause your dog to have difficulty breathing, your vet might need to remove the air and place a chest tube until the air leak seals on its own.
"
"Rarely, surgery may be needed to close the sites where air is leaking from the lung tissue. 
"
"Untreated cases where there’s severe lung inflammation and/or lung damage can result in death. 
"
"Most cases of lungworm respond to medical management alone (no surgery). In order to monitor your dog’s response to treatment, your veterinarian will want to examine more fecal samples for the lungworm larvae/eggs.
"
"If your vet found abnormalities on the original x-rays, they might want to retake the images to see how the abnormal areas look after treatment.
"
"Scarring of the airway(s) is a possible complication of lungworm infestation. If the scarring results in coughing or other asthma-like signs, this may require long-term management.
"
"Dogs that need surgery will require more time for recovery and healing. Depending on how long the chest tubes are in place and how extensive the lung surgery is, recovery can take 4-6 weeks.
"
"A dog becomes infected with lungworms by eating lungworm eggs and/or immature lungworm larvae. 
"
"Once in the GI tract, the larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the dog’s airways/lung tissue, where they live and produce more eggs and larvae.
"
"The eggs and larvae in the airways are then coughed up and spit out, or they are swallowed by the dog, which results in reinfection.
"
"Bowlegged stance in the hind limbs
"
"Hunched lower back
"
"Cracking or popping noises when the knee is bent
"
"Your veterinarian will combine these symptoms with the findings of their physical exam to make a definitive diagnosis.
"
"
"
" 
"
"A luxating patella in dogs is generally hereditary and has to do with the unusual knee anatomy of dogs that are affected.
"
"In some cases, trauma causes the luxation. Although body weight does not directly cause a luxating patella in dogs, it can contribute to the severity of the disease and can increase complication rates if surgery is pursued.
"
"Many small-breed and large-breed dogs are predisposed to having a luxating patella, including:

"Discoid lupus erythematosus, or DLE, is a less-aggressive form of lupus that only affects the skin of the nose and face.
"
"It is considered a benign variant of lupus and doesn’t progress to SLE.
"
"In addition to lesions that affect the face (lips, nose, around the eyes, and ears), pups may experience the following symptoms of skin disease:
"
"Nasal depigmentation (loss of color) and loss of normal texture to the nose
"
"Erythema (redness) of the skin
"
"Hair loss
"
"Scaling and crusting of the skin
"
"Skin ulcers
"
"Itching
"
"Dogs suffering from SLE may also show nonspecific symptoms, which can occur suddenly or come and go over time.
"
"These signs are attributed to which part of the body is affected.
"
"Unfortunately, dogs will often have multiple symptoms, such as:
"
"Skin lesions (seen in about 50% of SLE cases), often occurring throughout the body, but the face, ears, and extremities are more often affected
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes (under the jaw, armpits, behind the knees)

"No. Lungworm eggs and larvae cannot be readily seen by looking at dog feces with the naked eye. Your veterinarian can see both by looking at your dog’s fecal sample under a microscope.
"
"No, humans do not get lungworms. 
"
"However, it is important to keep your dog current on deworming (once or twice a year), as there are some worm parasites that can cause problems in humans.

"Usually, a physical exam is the only thing needed to diagnose a luxating patella in dogs. In fact, a luxating patella is often diagnosed incidentally during a routine wellness exam, or during an exam for a different problem.
"
"A luxating patella in dogs can also show up on imaging like x-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, but these diagnostics are not usually used to make the diagnosis.
"
"As with many orthopedic conditions in dogs, treatment options for a luxating patella can be divided into medical and surgical.
"
"Medical treatment of a luxating patella in dogs often involves anti-inflammatory medications, weight loss, and temporary exercise restriction.
"
"Exercise restriction varies based on the severity of your dog’s condition. For patellar luxation, it might be as simple as not letting your dog run up the stairs or jump on furniture, and only going on leash walks long enough for your dog to go to the bathroom.
"
"If your dog needs to be confined to their crate, the duration can vary based on the severity of your dog’s condition. Crate rest usually lasts at least 6 weeks, and sometimes more than 12.
"
"Surgery for a luxating patella in dogs is significantly more involved. Pet parents may pursue surgery in severe cases, or in cases where medical treatment has failed. As with any surgery, it comes with risks and the potential for complications.
"
"Increased heart rate
"
"Fainting

"Blood in the urine or stool
"
"Difficulty breathing or increased respiratory rate

"Bruising and pin-point hemorrhages seen on the gums or skin (petechiae)
"
"Kidney failure
"
"Swelling of the limbs or abdomen
"
"Female dogs tend to be more affected than males.
"
"Any breed and age can develop lupus. However, it tends to develop more in middle-aged dogs of certain breeds, which suggests a genetic factor. These breeds include:
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Chow Chows
"
"Siberian Huskies
"
"Shetland Sheepdogs
"
"Collies
"
"Beagles
"
"Cocker Spaniels
"
"Boxers
"
"Lupus is an autoimmune disease that in many cases, happens without a known cause.
"
"However, UV light and prolonged sun exposure may be factors.
"
"The disease is often worsened by the sun. Some veterinarians think some cases are tied to the use of certain medications, viruses, and other environmental factors.
"
"However, when all test results are analyzed together, they will provide your vet enough information to make a diagnosis.
"
"Your vet will take notice of any symptoms your pup may have been experiencing during a physical exam. They may then recommend that your dog have bloodwork and urine testing done.
"
"These tests look for evidence of anemia, a decreased platelet count, and protein in a dog’s urine.
"
"Additionally, these tests will look for infectious parasites and tick-borne diseases with tick PCR (a test looking for DNA of certain ticks in a dog’s blood) or tick titer tests (a test looking for a dog’s antibody response to the offending tick antigen).
"
"Your vet may also perform other tests that look for antibody and immune complex formation, such as:
"
"Coombs test. This test looks at antibodies targeted against red blood cells.
"
"ANA (antinuclear antibody test). This test looks for antibodies targeted against nuclear (DNA) antigens.
"
"Lupoid onychodystrophy, or symmetrical lupoid onychitis (SLO), is an uncommon medical condition that affects a dog’s toenails.
"
"It usually starts and progresses quickly, involving all four feet and multiple nails. The nails will get dry and brittle, crack, split, and eventually become deformed. The nails may even fall off. If one falls off, it leaves the “quick” (normally the pink or black area at the nailbed) exposed, which causes pain and possibly a secondary infection.
"
"
"

"
"The most common postoperative problem in MPL surgery is that the luxating patella will come back. Rates of recurrence are as high as 36% for the most severe cases, but often are less than 10% for milder forms.
"
"Implant failure, under-/overcorrection, avulsions (separations or detachments), fractures, infections, seromas (fluid-filled pockets), and progressive arthritis are other potential complications. Large-breed dogs and obese dogs are at higher risk for these issues. Interestingly, older dogs have fewer complications.
 
"
"Medical management of a luxating patella in dogs can take several weeks to show improvement. This option may also need to be repeated periodically throughout your dog’s life, depending on how often flare-ups occur. Exercise is a common reason for flare-ups, but sometimes flare-ups occur for no apparent reason.
"
"Surgical correction has a much longer recovery period—at least 8 weeks, often longer. Regular rechecks with the veterinary surgeon are a crucial part of your dog’s recovery after surgery.
"
"Mild or incidentally detected cases of patellar luxation in dogs are probably not painful, and therefore do not require surgical correction.
"
"However, moderate to severe cases, as well as chronic cases, can be painful. Having your veterinarian grade the luxation is the first step in determining whether your dog’s luxating patella is uncomfortable and whether treatment is warranted.
"
"Certainly. A luxating patella in dogs does not affect life expectancy, and mild cases do not affect your dog’s quality of life at all.
"
"In moderate to severe cases, dogs may limp chronically due to pain and discomfort. If left untreated, arthritis and other orthopedic abnormalities can develop that will significantly affect the quality of life, even if life expectancy is not affected.
"
"The pros and cons of medical management versus surgery should be discussed with your veterinarian to develop a plan that maximizes your dog’s comfort and overall health.
"
"As with most aspects of veterinary medicine, costs can vary dramatically depending on your location; rural areas tend to be cheaper, whereas urban areas are typically more expensive.
"
"If the condition requires medical management, in which anti-inflammatories and crate rest are recommended, the cost is generally reasonable and affordable.
"
"Surgical correction is more involved and of course more expensive.  Your vet will be able to give you an estimate based on your dog’s condition.
"
"The classic picture of a luxating patella in dogs is a small dog that will suddenly lift one of its hind limbs off the ground while walking or running.
"
"Your dog may go a short distance on three legs before placing the fourth leg back on the ground, seemingly unaware of and unbothered by the issue.
"
"In more serious or more chronic luxating patella cases, your dog may display a chronic limp or a crouched back. Their knee may crack or pop when flexed.
"
"However, these signs are not entirely specific to patellar luxation and can be seen in other orthopedic conditions. Your veterinarian will be able to confirm the diagnosis.
"
"No, braces are typically not useful for dogs with luxating patella.
"
"Although many brace products are marketed as nonsurgical solutions to a luxating patella, veterinarians do not commonly recommend braces to help this condition, for several reasons.
"
"First, orthopedic braces for dogs are costly, often several hundred dollars. Some vets would say that money would be better spent toward surgical correction.
"
"Second, these products typically recommend that your dog be “fitted” by your veterinarian. However, most general practitioners simply are not trained to do this.
"
"Third, your dog could become so bothered by the brace that they will shred or otherwise destroy it, setting them up for foreign body obstructions, a much more serious condition than a luxating patella.
"
"Although some general practitioners will perform surgical corrections for orthopedic conditions like a luxating patella in dogs, these conditions are more commonly treated by veterinary orthopedic surgeons.
"
"Costs for these specialists can be significantly higher than costs at your regular veterinarian due to the cutting-edge treatment and diagnostic equipment they use.
"
"Talk to your local veterinarian for more specific information about the treatment costs and options in your area.

"Lupus erythematosus (LE) cell test. This test looks for white blood cells that have engulfed nuclear material.
"
"Immunofluorescence testing. This test looks for evidence of certain antibodies.
"
"Diagnosis of DLE requires a biopsy (a test taken from a sample of the skin or tissue).
"
"In this procedure, several samples of a dog’s skin are surgically removed (often using local sedation or general anesthesia) and analyzed by a veterinary pathologist.
"
"In the case of SLE, biopsies of other organs along with fluid analysis of the joints, abdominal, or chest cavities may be taken.
"
"Stitches are usually removed after a few weeks.
"
"For some patients with a secondary skin infection, their vet may recommend that it’s treated for a few days before getting a biopsy, as pyoderma can make it harder to diagnose.
"
"Treatment includes blocking the immune system with prescription medications called immunosuppressants.
"
"Steroids, at high doses, are the drug that’s prescribed most often and is the most effective. However, they can have many negative and unappealing side effects, such as:
"
"Increased thirst and urination
"
"Gastrointestinal upset and ulceration
"
"Lethargy
"
"Increased risk of infection
"
"Increased risk of developing certain endocrine disorders
"
"Toxicity to the liver
"
"Bone marrow suppression, when too few blood cells are produced by the bone marrow
"
"To minimize or avoid these side effects, other immunosuppressive drugs may be used with steroids. These include:
"
"Azathioprine
"
"Chlorambucil
"
"Mycophenolate
"
"Cyclosporine
"
"Leflunomide
"
"Topical therapies are often prescribed to a pup, though this type of treatment is more common in dogs affected with DLE. This includes ointments, shampoos, or conditioners having antibacterial, antifungal and/or steroidal properties. 
"
"Topical ointments with tetracycline-niacinamide or tacrolimus are good options, especially for localized lesions.
"
"These ointments are often used with oral medications to decrease the dose of oral steroids a dog needs to take. Bathing your pet to remove crusts and scales can give itch relief and comfort, and it is soothing to the skin.
"
" This uncomfortable disease will cause your dog to lick their feet frequently and/or have trouble walking. Although this disease process is not completely understood, it is likely triggered by an overactive immune system and is not a contagious condition.
"
"It is also understood to be a genetic condition inherited from one or both of a dog’s parents. Often the changes to the nails are noted in young to middle-aged dogs between 2–8 years old, but they are also seen in puppies and senior dogs. German Shepherds, Rottweilers, and Gordon Setters represent the most common breeds to develop lupoid onychodystrophy.
"
"The condition should be treated as soon as possible to control any infection. If you notice any abnormalities in your pet’s toenails, or that they are licking their paws excessively, take them to the veterinarian for an exam.
"
"The nail problem begins in the nailbed and causes abnormal nail development. Often the first signs noted are secondary to pain—excessive foot or paw licking at the nails, or limping and lameness. The nail will then lift up off the nailbed, fall off, and leave the sensitive tissue underneath exposed.
"
"Typically, one or two nails are lost first, followed by shedding of all nails within weeks or months. Due to the pain caused by this condition, your dog will likely be reluctant to have its feet examined.
"
"Dogs affected with SLO will be otherwise healthy, although some cases have been reported to cause enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy).
"
"Nail bed infections can occur secondary to this disease and make the toes red and swollen, with an odor or discharge. This infection is often from the exposed nail bed encountering bacteria from the ground.
"
"Nails will quickly be:
"
"Split or cracked
"
"Brittle
"
"Thickened
"
"Deformed
"
"Have pus and/or blood beneath
"
"Have abnormal curvature
"
"
"
"Lupoid onychodystrophy affecting a dog’s nail, causing nail to fall off and exposing nail bed.

"
"The exact cause of lupoid onychodystrophy in dogs is unknown, but it is suspected to be an immune-mediated disease condition with a genetic component. SLO is the most common immune-mediated disease that results in abnormal nails, and eventually nail loss.
"
"Your veterinarian might be able to make a presumptive diagnosis of SLO due to the appearance of the toenails and your dog’s history. But they may first seek to rule out other causes, such as a bacterial or yeast infection, ringworm, and some cancers.
"
"A culture of the affected nail can rule out bacteria, fungus, or ringworm. X-rays should also be done to ensure that the underlying bone is healthy and no evidence of cancer is seen. Ultimately, a biopsy of the nailbed or a fine needle aspirate can be done to look at the cells (a process known as histopathology or cytology).
"
"Depending on the severity of the nail bed lesion, sometimes a digit amputation at the dewclaw is performed for biopsy. The nail that falls off will not provide a diagnosis; the nailbed is needed for it. These test results should confirm a diagnosis of SLO if your dog is affected.
"
"There are several treatment options for dogs affected with SLO. Unfortunately, no single treatment protocol has been established for treating this uncommon condition. The mainstay of treatment is aimed at suppressing the immune system. It often takes six to 12 weeks for the toenails to start to improve. The medications may initially need to be adjusted, but the one your vet finds the most effective for treatment is usually for life.
"
"Common medications, supplements, and treatments prescribed or recommended include:
"
"Fatty acids—specifically EPA and DHA commonly found in fish oils, which are a cornerstone of treatment
"
"Cyclosporine, azathioprine—immune suppressants
"
"Prednisone (or other corticosteroids)—used for severe cases initially, but not prescribed long-term
"
"Pentoxifylline—suppresses inflammatory reactions
"
"Vitamin E

"Sun exposure and UV light can also make lesions worse, so limit sun exposure as much as possible.
"
"Walk your dog in the early morning or late evening and use a pet-approved sunscreen on the bridge of the nose and non-haired skin. You may also want to purchase a doggie hat or visor for your pup.
"
"Because many dogs with lupus also suffer from secondary skin infections, antibiotics may also be prescribed. These could include:
"
"Cephalexin
"
"Clavamox
"
"Clindamycin
"
"Antifungal medications, like fluconazole or miconazole
"
"Dogs with lupus often don’t need a change of diet or supplements, but talk with your vet about the best topicals, supplements, and diet for your dog based on their specific medical and nutritional needs.
"
"Fatty acid supplements can help maintain the skin barrier and reduce inflammation, and prescription diets can help support dogs’ immune systems.
"
"Lupus is not a curable disease in dogs.
"
"However, dogs with DLE typically have a good prognosis. Usually, improvement in their condition is seen within eight to 12 weeks.
"
"The prognosis for dogs affected by SLE—especially if multiple organs are affected—can be worse.
"
"When significant complications develop, such as seizures and kidney failure, a pup’s prognosis is quite poor, and humane euthanasia may be recommended.
"
"Lupus—both DLE and SLE—can be managed by an attentive pet parent. Pups often need lifelong medication.
"
"It may take several months to see healing in your pup, and there may be scarring of their skin and permanent pigment loss as well as other symptoms, such as chronic kidney failure.
"
"Once your dog is improved and symptoms have resolved, your vet may then recommend reducing the immunosuppressive drugs. This occurs so your dog can get the lowest dose that works and minimize any uncomfortable side effects.
"
"Relapse—the return of your dog’s symptoms—may occur during this time, but it’s important not to lose hope because the long-term benefits of reducing drug therapy outweigh the risks.
"
"Consistent and proper follow-up care with your vet is very important to lower the risk of relapse. Make sure to watch the disease and any drug side effects.
"
"Be sure to follow all your vet’s recommendations, and do not stop the drugs suddenly or decrease the dose or frequency without talking with your vet first.
"
"Unfortunately, lupus cannot be prevented.
"
"If your dog gets it, it is important to follow your vet’s recommendations because they can help minimize your pup’s flare-ups.
"
"Because certain medications—including vaccines—have the potential to trigger an affected dog’s immune system, they should be given with caution, as recommended by your vet, or not at all.
"
"Dogs with lupus have a variable life expectancy. Those with DLE have a longer life expectancy than those with SLE.
"
"About 50% of dogs will achieve long-term remission, but some dogs—especially those whose organs have been affected with kidney failure or neurologic deficits or who have adverse drug side effects—may be euthanized (about 40% of cases in the first year).
"
"Both SLE and DLE carry serious and life-threatening risks if left untreated.
"
"Tetracycline or doxycycline combined with niacinamide (vitamin B3)
"
"Frequent nail trims
"
"Antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections
"
"More aggressive treatment for severe or recurrent cases of SLO include onychectomy, which is surgical removal of the toe tip, often done with a laser or a scalpel blade.
"
"This surgical procedure is not commonly done unless there is significant unmanageable pain and deformity of the nail bed.
"
"Overall prognosis once SLO is treated is good, but nails may continue to break easily and remain deformed. It can take three to four months to see a clinical improvement with successful therapy. 
"
"It is important to give all medications and supplements as prescribed by your veterinarian. Do not discontinue any without their approval, even if you believe it is not helping, because a relapse can occur.
"
"Frequent nail trims are very important and should be done every one to two weeks for the rest of your dog’s life. In some cases, your veterinarian may taper the medications after six months of successful treatment, but they are usually required for life.
"
"It’s beneficial to keep your dog’s paws and toes clean and dry at all times, and to use a medicated wipe after walks outdoors.
"
"Diets enhanced with fatty acids, such as Purina® Pro Plan® for Sensitive Skin &amp; Stomach and Hill's® Science Diet, are recommended if your dog will not easily take a supplement or if they need additional sources.

"Torsion, or twisting, of the lung lobe results in the obstruction of the dog's bronchus and vessels, including the veins and arteries. The obstruction of the blood vessels causes the lung lobe to engorge with blood, which results in necrosis and death of the affected lung tissue. This may lead to many complications, including coughing up blood, tachycardia, or shock.
"
"Male dogs are at a higher risk of lung lobe torsion than females, as are large, deep-chested. However, small dogs such as pugs (especially those younger than four) are also at risk, most often with the spontaneous form of lung lobe torsion.
"
"Lung lobe torsion is inconsistently found with pre-existing conditions such as trauma, neoplasia, and chylothorax. However it also occurs spontaneously, due to a thoracic or diaphragmatic surgery, or, on occasion, due to an unknown cause (idiopathic).
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). These tests may reveal valuable information for initial diagnosis and may show signs of infection, anemia. It will also reveal the level of immune response of your dog. If the number of white blood cells is abnormally lower than the minimum normal range, the prognosis is very poor.
"
"Your dog’s veterinarian may decide to take a small sample of the accumulated fluid for further evaluation, while ultrasound, computed tomography, and radiographic studies often reveal more details about the problem. Loss of normal architecture and blood vessels, along with opacification of the affected lung are usually seen in an X-ray.
"
"In some cases, surgery is required for definitive diagnosis and treatment.
"
"
"
"Your dog may need to be hospitalized for intensive care and treatment, especially if surgery is required, which is often the treatment of choice to remove the affected lobe and correct other abnormalities. If abnormal fluid or blood is present, your veterinarian will place a chest tube to allow for drainage. If your dog is not able to breathe normally, ventilator support is given to assist in breathing. Oxygen therapy, fluids, and antibiotics are also typically added to treatment protocol. And if the dog survives, shrinking and fibrosis of the affected lobe will be seen.
"
"After surgery, your dog may feel sore and need pain killers, as well as cage rest, for a few days. However, most animals recover fully after a successful operation. The chest tube is often kept in for a few days to allow drainage of fluid. Your veterinarian will describe the proper handling of this tube. If you see any untoward symptoms, including breathing problems, immediately call your dog’s veterinarian. Otherwise, follow his or her instructions and bring the dog in for regular examinations.
"
"Lung cancer in dogs is a relatively rare type of cancer. When a dog has lung cancer, it means their lungs have been invaded by malignant tumors. Unlike benign (non-cancerous) tumors, malignant tumors can spread throughout the body, causing serious and potentially fatal health complications.
"
"Lung cancer can affect your dog’s breathing by reducing lung function. When your dog takes a breath, oxygen flows from their mouth into their trachea and then into a series of small tubes called bronchi that travel into the lungs. In the lungs, the bronchi end in tiny sacs called alveoli. This is where gas exchange takes place, as red blood cells give up carbon dioxide, which is exhaled, in exchange for fresh oxygen.  
"
"Although lung cancer is a serious condition in dogs, fortunately it’s relatively rare. Only about 1% of cancers diagnosed in dogs are in the lungs. However, because of the high blood supply to the lungs, a lot of cancers from elsewhere in the body tend to spread there. This means that tumors found in the lungs more commonly spread from other parts of the body instead of originating within the lungs (a primary lung tumor).
"
"While dogs could get lung cancer at any age, this mostly affects older dogs. The typical age for diagnosis is 9 to 11 years of age.
"
"About 97% of primary lung tumors in dogs are carcinomas. Carcinomas are cancers that begin in the tissues that line internal organs or in the skin. The most common type of primary lung cancer is called bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
"
"As in humans, veterinarians “grade” lung cancer in dogs to help make treatment decisions. The grade is based on how fast the tumor is growing, certain characteristics of the cells, and whether there is necrosis (death) of the cells. According to the Veterinary Society of Surgical Oncology, 46% of primary lung carcinomas are grade I (spreading more slowly), 43% are grade II (moderately spreading), and 10% are grade III (spreading more quickly). Low-grade tumors generally have a better prognosis than high-grade tumors.
"
"Other types of cancer that rarely originate in the lungs include histiocytic sarcoma and lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system).
"
"Dogs with lung cancer often won’t have symptoms until the tumor has advanced. These tumors may be found during chest X-rays performed for another health reason.
"
"Symptoms of lung cancer in dogs include:
"

"
"Coughing
"
"Elevated respiratory rate
"
"Coughing up blood
"
"Exercise intolerance
"
"Respiratory distress
"
"Weight loss and muscle wasting
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Lung cancers can also cause a secondary condition called hypertrophic osteopathy, which typically affects the long bones of the limbs. The connective tissue on the bones grows rapidly, causing the limbs to become swollen and firm. The pet may limp or be reluctant to move. The underlying cause of hypertrophic osteopathy is not well understood, but it typically resolves if the mass is treated.
"
"The exact cause of lung cancer in dogs is unknown, though genetics is thought to play a role. Environmental pollutants, such as secondhand smoke, may also contribute to the development of lung cancer in dogs, though research is ongoing.
"
"Breeds thought to have a higher likelihood of developing lung cancer include:
"
"Boxers
"
"Doberman Pinschers
"
"Australian Shepherds
"
"Irish Setters
"
"Bernese Mountain Dogs
"
"Lung cancer can’t be diagnosed with a basic physical examination. Instead, your veterinarian will need additional tests, possibly including:
"
"Chest X-rays: The first test a veterinarian will run is chest X-rays. For some pets, this will require light sedation. If the veterinarian sees a solitary, well-defined nodule in the lungs, this is more likely to be a primary lung tumor than a metastatic nodule that has spread from elsewhere.
"
"Fine needle aspirate: To know what type of cancer your dog has, a veterinarian may perform a test called a fine needle aspirate (FNA) to collect a sample of cells. This test includes placing a needle through the chest wall and into the lesion to remove (aspirate) cells. Your pet will need to be sedated for this procedure.
"
"Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage: In some cases, the vet may perform a test called a bronchoalveolar lavage. During this test, sterile fluid is placed into the airway and then retrieved and studied. Malignant cells may be seen in the fluid, allowing for definitive diagnosis. This procedure is often done in conjunction with another test called a bronchoscopy, where a camera is inserted down into the larger airways. Your pet would need to be anesthetized for this procedure.
"
"A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest may be performed to assess the number and size of pulmonary masses. A CT may also be recommended for surgical planning.
"
"Imaging of the abdomen and aspiration of peripheral lymph nodes may be advised to check for cancer spread. With primary lung tumors, the results will often be normal. If the nodules in the lungs are suspected to be metastatic from elsewhere, these tests may help determine where the cancer originated.
"
"Your family veterinarian can likely perform chest X-rays, abdominal X-rays, aspiration of peripheral lymph nodes, and possibly ultrasound of the abdomen. Aspiration of tumors in the chest, bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, and CT scans are often outside of the scope of private practice, so you may be referred to a specialist. 
"
"When your dog is diagnosed with lung cancer, your veterinarian will stage the cancer. Staging describes how far the cancer has spread within the body. The stage will be used to create a treatment plan. Staging of lung cancer in dogs is based on the size of the primary tumor, if the tumor has spread to nearby lymph nodes, and if the cancer has spread beyond its original site (metastasized).
"
"While lung cancer in humans is often staged using Roman numerals, this system is not routinely used in dogs. However, some veterinarians may use these stages to explain the spread of cancer to pet parents. These stages include:
"
"Stage I: The tumor is small and has not spread to lymph nodes.
"
"Stage II: The tumor has grown larger and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.
"
"Stage III: The cancer has spread to the lymph nodes between the lung lobes.
"
"Stage IV: Cancer has spread from the lung to other parts of the body.
"
"The treatment plan depends on the type and severity of the cancer. For a single tumor, surgery is the treatment of choice. During surgery, the surgeon removes part of or the entire lung lobe, depending on the size and location of the mass. The veterinarian will likely biopsy lymph nodes in the chest to determine if the cancer has spread.
"
"Some veterinary oncologists may recommend chemotherapy for high-grade tumors, large tumors, or tumors that show evidence of metastasis. In most cases of primary lung tumors in dogs, chemotherapy alone does not improve survival.
"
"Dogs that have metastatic nodules from cancer elsewhere in the body have a poorer prognosis. This is because these nodules prove the cancer has advanced enough to spread to the lungs. A consultation with a veterinary oncologist is recommended.
"
"In dogs that have no metastases and undergo surgery, the procedure may result in a cure. Some dogs can live for over two years post-surgery. Expected survival time ranges from three months to over a year, with dogs who have no clinical signs at time of diagnosis, low-grade tumors, and smaller tumors typically living longer than others.
"
"Many pet parents elect not to have their pet go through open-chest surgery when there is evidence that the tumor is aggressive. Even with surgical treatment, the prognosis is three months in these cases.
"
"If you choose to pursue treatment for your dog’s lung cancer, your veterinarian may recommend frequent chest X-rays for the first year after surgery to monitor for recurrence. If your pet is undergoing chemotherapy, frequent monitoring of their bloodwork is required to ensure they are tolerating chemotherapy.
"
"Other steps you can take to keep your pet comfortable include:
"
"Ensuring they have easy access to food and water
"
"Providing a comfortable area to rest
"
"Ensuring they avoid strenuous exercise
"
"Not smoking indoors
"
"Using a room air purifier
"
"Ensuring you’re consistent with your pet’s medications
"
"Speaking with your veterinarian if you’re concerned that your pet may be in pain
"
"In dogs who are declining, your veterinarian will recommend a palliative care plan to keep your pet comfortable. Treatments could include anti-nausea medications, pain medications, cough suppressants, and anti-anxiety medications.
"
"In the end stages of lung cancer, your dog may have a decreased appetite, weight loss, muscle wasting, lethargy, coughing, wheezing, and labored breathing. In some cases, fluid develops in and around the lungs, which makes breathing very difficult. If you note labored breathing, seek prompt veterinary attention.
"
"Whether or not lung cancer is aggressive in dogs depends on the type of tumor and its grade. With surgical removal and no sign of metastases, your pet may be cured. If the tumor has metastasized to elsewhere in the chest or body, these are signs of a more aggressive cancer.

"Hypokalemia refers to lower than normal concentrations of potassium in the blood. A vital element to an important group of blood minerals called electrolytes, potassium functions in both cellular and electricual functions, such as in the conduction of electrical charges in the heart, nerves, and muscles.Therefore, lower levels of potassium in the bloodstream will compromise the normal functioning ability of these tissues.
"
"Symptoms relate to the underlying cause of hypokalemia. Some of the more common ones include:
"
"You will need to give a detailed history of your dog’s health, the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents or conditions that might have led to this condition.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all body systems. Routine blood tests, including a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis are important for the diagnosis of hypokalemia and its underlying cause. In chronic kidney failure patients, blood tests may reveal normochromic (hemoglobin contents of RBCs are normal), normocytic (overall hemoglobin levels are decreased), and nonregenerative (bone marrow responding inadequately to the increased demand of RBC) anemia.
"
"Higher levels of blood urea nitrogen (waste products [urea] in the blood that are normally excreted in the urine and voided from the body) and creatinine may also be found in patients with hypokalemia due to kidney failure. Urinalysis may reveal inadequate urine concentrating ability in patients with chronic kidney failure. In diabetic patients, the urinalysis may reveal high glucose levels and ketone bodies in urine.
"
"Abdominal X-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT-Scan), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used to diagnose the underlying cause of hypokalemia.
"
"
"
"Your dog may need to be hospitalized if its condition is severe enough to warrant an emergency. The initial treatment includes supplementation of potassium and treatment to stabilize dangerous symptoms like irregular heart beating and paralysis of respiratory muscles. Once your dog has been stabilized, maintenance dosages of potassium will be administrated. Once diagnosed, the underlying disease can be treated to prevent another episode of hypokalemia.
"
"Your dog's potassium levels may need to be measured every 6 to 24 hours, especially during the initial phase of treatment. Call your veterinarian if you see any change in symptom at home during treatment.

"When the brain is deprived of oxygen, irreversible damage may be the result, even when the deprivation has been for a short period of time. Oxygen deficiency may also lead to anemia in the organs, which can progress to arrhythmia and heart failure. Hypoxemia occurs when arterial blood is not being oxygenated sufficiently. This is a serious condition and needs to be treated quickly.
"
"Your veterinarian will be looking for rapid breathing, over-excitement, and anxious behavior in your dog. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, and any possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The more details you can provide, the better able your doctor will be to determine which organs are being affected by the lack of oxygen. The veterinarian will also check for an elevated body temperature, and will examine your dog for any head injuries. Blood samples from specific areas will be drawn; blood gas analyzers may be also used to make measuring more convenient.
"
"In addition, X-rays and echocardiograms can be used to rule out lung and heart disease as the cause of the oxygen deficiency in the blood. If the cause cannot be determined using any of these methods, an endoscopy or biopsy of the lung may be performed.
"
"
"
"Treatment is dependent on the underlying cause of the oxygen deficiency. Oxygen will be given to support your dog's heart and lungs (cardiovascular system) using a face mask placed securely around the muzzle to deliver the oxygen. It is important to keep in mind, however, that this treatment is not always successful.
"
"If the problem is low cardiac output, intravenous (IV) medications to strengthen muscle action will be prescribed. In case of cardiac failure, diuretics and oxygen will be administered, as well as medications to strengthen muscle action.
"
"If there is hemorrhaging, injury, or shock from infection, hospitalization will be required to get an IV inserted and fluids flowing into the veins. This will also allow the oxygen to reach appropriate levels.
"
"Hypoxemia is a life-threatening condition. Therefore, observe your dog's behavior carefully following the treatment. Symptoms to watch for include a decreased ability to breathe, as well any paleness of the tissues, which would be indicative of a lack of oxygen diffusion to the tissues. Frequent follow-up visits to the veterinarian will be needed to track arterial blood gas levels.

"Neutrophils are white blood cells essential to a dog’s immune system. Produced in the bone marrow, these cells travel through the bloodstream to be first on the scene to sites of infection and inflammation. They will bind bacteria and viruses as well as signal for other white blood cells to come to the affected part of the body and help fight the infection.
"
"Because neutrophils are the most common white blood cell, a significant decrease in neutrophil numbers (neutropenia) can leave dogs unable to resist infections. Low neutrophil counts can be due to decreased production in the bone marrow, increased use in the body, or abnormal destruction of the cells. Severe neutropenia in dogs is uncommon, but if it isn’t treated it can lead to serious health complications.
"
"Low white blood cell count in dogs may be found on lab work in apparently healthy pups. Though these cases are not emergencies, they should be investigated and treated immediately if necessary to avoid potentially dangerous health issues. In other cases, severe lethargy and fever that require emergency care may be the first signs that something is wrong.
"
"The survival of dogs with a low white blood cell count depends on how treatable the underlying cause is. Infections may respond easily to antibiotics with no chance for recurrence. Bone marrow abnormalities and cancers can be harder to manage and are more likely to be fatal.
"
"Symptoms of low white blood cell count in dogs include:
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Fever
"
"Lethargy/weakness
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Bruising
"
"Pale gums
"
"Lameness
"
"Low white blood cell (neutrophil) counts in dogs can have several different causes, including:
"
"Infection
"
"Parvovirus
"
"Hepatitis
"
"Ehrlichiosis
"
"Fungal infections
"
"Sepsis
"
"Medications
"
"Chemotherapy
"
"Estrogens
"
"Thyroid medication (methimazole)
"
"Seizure medication (phenobarbital)
"
"Antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim)
"
"Genetics
"
"Canine cyclic neutropenia (gray Collies)
"
"Hypovitaminosis B12 (Giant Schnauzers)
"
"Autoimmune Disorders
"
"Immune-mediated neutropenia
"
"Cancer
"
"Leukemia
"
"Multiple myeloma
"
"Low white blood cell count in dogs is usually confirmed on a complete blood count (CBC) test. In dogs, an abnormal count is fewer than 3,000 cells per microliter.
"
"A small decrease may be normal in some dogs and not a concern. If there are no symptoms, your dog’s breed, age, and medical history (including medications, parasite preventatives, and vaccines) will help your vet determine how serious the neutropenia is.
"
"A physical exam, blood chemistry, urinalysis, X-rays, and abdominal ultrasound may help your vet determine the cause of neutropenia and how best to treat it. Your vet will often use these tests to look for infections or evidence of cancer.
"
"Screening for blood and fecal parasites is important, especially in areas where tick-borne ehrlichiosis is common. Some cases may require a bone marrow biopsy to look for bone marrow cancers and abnormalities in how the body is producing these cells.
"
"Because the most common causes of low white blood cell count in dogs are infections and drug reactions, this syndrome is often treatable with antibiotics or discontinuation of the drug causing the issue. Complete remission can be expected.
"
"Immune-mediated neutropenia also has a good prognosis, with most dogs returning to normal neutrophil counts within weeks after being administered immunosuppressive medications. Some dogs may require long-term medications for this disease.
"
"Bone marrow cancers have a poorer prognosis, relying on chemotherapy for treatment, which can have its own bone marrow effects. While Giant Schnauzer neutropenia can usually be managed with lifelong vitamin B12 supplementation, Gray Collies born with cyclic neutropenia rarely live to be adults. 
"
"Treatable causes of low white blood cell counts in dogs respond quickly to therapy, and most dogs will feel much better within weeks of receiving treatment.
"
"Severe infections like parvovirus may require intensive hospitalization. In many cases, treatment can be discontinued once cell numbers have normalized, though some immune-mediated conditions may require lifelong medications.
"
"With aggressive care, some bone marrow cancers can go into remission and affected dogs can have good quality of life for months to years. Prognosis highly depends on response to treatment.
"
"Routine wellness blood work can help identify low white blood cell counts in dogs before they feel ill. Dogs on long-term medications that can cause neutropenia should have blood counts performed at least annually to monitor for neutropenia.
"
"Vaccines and parasite prevention (such as NexGard®, Bravecto®, Seresto®, or Simparica Trio™) can go a long way in preventing severe infections that cause neutropenia.
"
"Prompt care of wounds and appropriate antibiotic use can help avoid sepsis and antibiotic-resistant infections.  
"
"Abnormally low white blood cell counts in a dog are any value fewer than 3,000 cells per microliter on a complete blood count.
"
"As the body has neutrophils that don’t travel in the bloodstream, how serious neutropenia is depends on more than just the number.
"
"A vet will be more concerned if a very low value does not improve or if numbers decrease over time. Clinical signs such as fever or lethargy or decreases in the numbers of other cells will also indicate a more severe issue. Dogs with fewer than 2,000 cells per microliter are at significantly higher risk of infection.
"
"White blood cell counts in dogs, unlike red blood cell counts, cannot be increased directly with transfusions or medications.
"
"Improving low white blood cell counts in dogs requires treating the underlying condition, if possible. A dog’s ability to fight infection can sometimes be supported with antibiotics while the bone marrow works to create more neutrophils.

"
"The overall health of a dog is often reflected in their skin. Dogs can get lumps, bumps, and cysts from normal aging, or they can be signs of a problem.
"
"There are two major types of lumps and bumps on dogs: malignant (cancerous) and benign (not cancerous). However, you can’t tell the type or severity of a growth just by looking at it. A veterinarian can take a sample of cells to give you a diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.  
"
"Hypoparathyroidism  is characterized by an absolute or relative deficiency of parathyroid hormone in the blood. The parathyroid hormone regulates calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, normally increasing blood calcium levels by causing calcium to be reabsorbed from the bone. Low levels of parathyroid hormone secretion will therefore lead to low levels of calcium in the blood, a condition called hypocalcemia.
"
"The parathyroid glands are small, hormone-secreting glands that are located on or near the thyroid glands, which are in turn located at the front of the neck, in alignment with the larynx and trachea.
"
"In dogs, there is a predilection for hypoparathyroidism in toy poodles, miniature schnauzers, German shepherd dogs, Labrador retrievers, and terrier breeds. The average age of diagnosis is 4.8 years, with a range of six weeks to 13 years. There also appears to be a gender difference, as females tend to be diagnosed in higher numbers.
"
"Hypoparathyroidism is most commonly of unknown cause, or is the result of an immune-mediated inflammation of the parathyroid gland.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms that you are able to provide. Standard testing, including a complete blood profile will be conducted, as well as a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The results of these tests will usually return normal in the case of hypoparathyroidism, however, they are important in discounting any other underlying disorders.
"
"Because there are several possible causes for the symptoms described here, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. The main problems associated with hypoparathyroidism that must be differentiated from other disease processes are seizures, weakness, muscle trembling, and twitching.
"
"Some of the causes that will need to be ruled out are heart related diseases, metabolic diseases, such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hepatoencephalopathy (liver disease that affects the brain's functioning). Neurological causes that will need to be ruled out are inflammatory diseases, tumors, or epilepsy.
"
"An exploration of the cervical section of the throat may reveal that the parathyroid glands are absent or have atrophied (wasted).
"
"
"
"Your dog may need to be hospitalized initially for medical management of low levels of calcium in the blood, at least until the clinical signs are controlled. Other treatment will be dependent on whether any other underlying conditions have been diagnosed.
"
"Emergency treatment is usually only needed for certain patients, such as those with primary hypoparathyroidism, or hypoparathyroidism that is secondary to procedures that have been used to correct excessive levels of thyroid hormone or excessive levels of parathyroid hormone -- that is, procedures that have been medically used to lower the amount of parathyroid hormone in the blood, and have resulted in levels of parathyroid hormone that are now too low.
"
"If your dog has been diagnosed with hypocalcemia, low calcium levels in the blood, your doctor will prescribe long-term treatment for the condition. Vitamin D will be needed indefinitely, with the dosage amount determined by your veterinarian, based on your dog's needs. Calcium supplements can be given by mouth, again, with the type and dose of calcium supplement directed by your veterinarian
"
"Both low levels of calcium in the blood and excessive levels of calcium in the blood are concerns that will need to be managed over the long-term. Initially, your veterinarian will want to see your dog frequently in order to follow your dog's progress and to make changes to care as needed. Once serum calcium is stable and normal, your veterinarian will assess serum calcium concentration monthly for six months, and then every two to four months.

"
"Here are several common skin growths found in dogs, along with info on what they look like and what to watch for:
"
"Tumors that are benign are not invasive or likely to spread to other body areas.
"
"A histiocytoma is a benign skin growth that usually occurs in dogs less than 2 years of age. They are found on the front half of a dog’s body, usually on the head or legs. Rarely, they can be seen in older dogs or on other areas of the body.
"
"Histiocytomas are pink and fleshy but may get bigger and seem more irritated before improving. These tumors usually regress spontaneously over time without treatment and arise from the skin’s immune cells. They can be diagnosed through microscopic examination of a sample of cells from the growth.
"
"A lipoma may show up anywhere on a dog’s body but is common on the trunk and legs. Lipomas come from fat cells under the skin or are found in muscle tissue. They usually develop in older, overweight dogs. They may become quite large or appear in multiple locations.
"
"A vet can diagnose a lipoma by taking a small sample of cells from the growth to look for fat droplets. No treatment is needed, but these should be monitored for rapid changes. They will gradually enlarge with time, and may bother your dog if they’re located in an area that interferes with motion. When lipomas start to bother your pet, you can consider surgical removal.
"
"A papilloma in young dogs is a contagious, wart-like growth that usually occurs in and around the mouth. In older dogs, they might be seen around the eyes or on other areas of the body. Papillomas are caused by a virus that can be spread through direct contact with an infected dog or contaminated items, such as toys or feeding bowls.
"
"They appear small, fleshy, and round with a cauliflower-like texture to the surface. Many will dry up and fall off within a few months as the dog’s immune system matures. Severe cases may make eating or swallowing difficult and require treatment by surgical removal. Medications and other treatment methods are also available, including crushing of the warts to stimulate the immune system.
"
"Another type of papilloma is a skin wart that is more common in older dogs. These are usually solitary and not caused by a virus. These bumps may have a hardened surface that looks like a cauliflower. An inverted papilloma may also be seen in young adult dogs, especially on the lower abdomen. If the growth bothers the pet, surgical removal is an option.
"
"A skin tag grows in places where a dog’s skin rubs together. They are overgrowths of the connective tissue in the skin. They are the same color as the skin but extend out from the surface on thin stalks.
"
"Skin tags are common in older dogs and certain breeds. No treatment is needed, but these can be surgically removed if they are bothersome.
"
"A sebaceous gland tumor is commonly found in older dogs. They are typically smaller than a pea and may develop in any location. Some will bleed or secrete a material that forms a crust. Large breeds often form these on their head, specifically their eyelids, and they may be black in color. Treatment is not necessary, but surgical removal may be considered when the growth is bothersome.
"
"A meibomian gland tumor is a slow-growing benign lump that forms in the meibomian gland at the edge of the eyelid. The tumor can stick out or grow into the eyelid. They may become inflamed, irritated, painful, or ulcerated. They may also cause inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva.
"
"Large tumors may cause problems when your dog blinks, because they cause extra tearing and tear staining. They are diagnosed by their appearance and location, and they can be removed with surgery, or the tissue can be frozen for removal. They rarely grow back after removal, but  regrowth is possible.
"
"An epulis is a common benign growth found in the mouth of dogs. They may form when a tooth rubs against the gums, as with an underbite in brachycephalic (flat-faced) breeds.
"
"These smooth, fleshy, pink bumps grow on the gum tissue near the outer surface of an incisor, canine, or premolar tooth. They can appear to grow on a stalk of tissue, like a mushroom, or as an unmoving mass, and they may have a bony interior. Certain types can invade surrounding bony tissue.
"
"Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians.
"
"Diagnosis of an epulis is made by recognizing it from appearance and confirming with a biopsy. An x-ray of your dog’s head will show if it has invaded surrounding tissues. These growths should be removed surgically, along with the adjacent tooth and any bony tissue that may be affected. They do not usually regrow if the entire tumor is removed. Radiation therapy may help cases where the growth is inoperable.
"
"Follicular cysts are large, benign bumps on the skin that grow up from the hair follicle. They may release a thick material that is white, yellow, or brown when you push on them. As they get bigger, they can become itchy or painful.
"
"These types of cysts are diagnosed on physical examination and may be confirmed with microscopic examination of a small sample of cells aspirated with a needle. Follicular cysts may become infected and require antibiotic treatment. If they are growing or become painful, they may be surgically removed and should not regrow.
"
"Perianal adenomas are benign growths common in older, unneutered male dogs. They grow from oil glands near the anus but can also occur in similar glands along the abdomen, on the back, and near the tail.
"
"These commonly show up as multiple small lumps. Larger tumors may develop bleeding ulcerations and can compress the anal canal, making it difficult for your dog to poop.
"
"Almost all male dogs are cured by castration alone, but large or ulcerated tumors may also be surgically removed. Females improve with surgical removal, but the growths often recur. Laser surgery or freezing the growth may be necessary to avoid fecal incontinence when surgery involves the anal sphincter.
"
"Hemangiomas are benign tumors that occur in adult dogs and closely resemble blood vessels. You usually see them on a dog’s legs and trunk. They may be single growths or multiple, compressible, reddish-black circular lumps that can resemble a blood blister. Some may become large and even ulcerate. The recommended treatment is surgical removal.
"
"A nevus is a dark raised or flat benign growth on the skin, commonly called a mole. These are found on areas prone to trauma, such as the legs, head, and neck, usually in older dogs. Treatment is surgical removal.
"
"Trichoepitheliomas are small, benign lumps that pop up from the hair follicles of adult dogs. They are cyst-like and filled with condensed, yellow, cheesy, granular material. They can occur anywhere on the body, but especially on the face and trunk. Treatment is surgical removal, but they are likely to continue to form at other locations, even after surgery.
"
"Cornifying epitheliomas are benign growths that stick up from the skin surface and look like horns. They arise from hair follicles and may form anywhere on a dog’s body, but they are more common on the back, tail, and legs of adult dogs. No treatment is necessary unless there is evidence of self-trauma, ulceration, or secondary infection. Surgical removal is the ideal treatment.
"
"Basal cell tumors are benign growths that develop on the head, ears, neck, and forelimbs of older dogs. They are raised swellings that are typically firm, solitary, dome-shaped, and small. Some may be hairless, ulcerated, and stick out like stalks from the surface of the skin. They are dark in color and may form cysts that break open and drain fluid or pus. Treatment is surgical removal, especially when the dog is uncomfortable.
"
"Malignant tumors are cancerous growths that can invade tissue and spread to organs.
"
"Angiosarcomas are highly malignant blood vessel tumors that may vary in appearance. One or more red lumps in the skin or underlying soft tissue are commonly seen, but they may also appear as a poorly defined bruise.
"
"All types grow rapidly and destroy surrounding tissue. They also spread to the lungs and liver. Angiosarcomas may occur in response to sun exposure in dog breeds with short, white coats, but dogs with dark, thick coats can develop them as well.
"
"They usually form on the underside of the trunk, hip, thigh, and lower legs. A biopsy is required for a diagnosis. Freezing and laser surgery can help control smaller surface tumors. Surgical removal is needed for tumors below the skin’s surface. Chemotherapy may also be recommended to treat any remaining tumor cells.
"
"Basal cell carcinomas are flattened or raised growths that appear anywhere on the body of an older dog. They may spread to surrounding skin, forming new ulcerations, but they rarely spread to other organs. Surgical removal is recommended, including enough skin around the tumor to ensure that no tumor cells remain.
"
"Liposarcomas are rare but may develop in older male dogs on the chest and legs. They can be soft or firm lumps that are slow to spread to other locations. Treatment is surgical removal, but recurrence is common. If this happens, radiation treatment may also be required.
"
"Lymphosarcoma rarely develops directly on a dog’s skin but may be seen as a surface tumor or along with internal tumors. It can look like flaky skin, red patches, raised and ulcerated areas, or lumps deep within the skin.
"
"There are two forms of skin lymphosarcoma that differ in their expected progression and response to treatment, so it is important to determine which type your dog has early on. Treatments include surgical removal, chemotherapy, and radiation, done separately or combined. These treatments may improve the signs of the disease but do not lengthen the dog’s life expectancy.
"
"Mast cell tumors are the most common malignant tumor seen in dogs. They often affect older dogs but can occur in dogs of any age.
"
"They develop solitary growths anywhere on the body, especially the limbs, lower abdomen, and chest. Larger or rapidly growing tumors and those in certain locations are more likely to spread. Their appearance can greatly vary, but most are raised and either soft or firm to the touch.
"
"Your vet will need to examine a sample of cells from the growth under a microscope to confirm a diagnosis. There is variation on how aggressive these tumors are. Surgical removal is necessary. If the tumor regrows or spreads, other treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation, may be used.
"
"Malignant melanomas are another type of skin tumor of older dogs. They commonly develop on the lips, mouth, and nail beds of male dogs. They appear as raised, ulcerated lumps and may be dark, light gray, or pink. If they appear in the nail bed, the toe is often swollen.
"
"These tumors grow quickly and may spread quickly to other organs. Complete surgical removal is the preferred treatment, but it may be difficult and involves removal of adjacent tissue to prevent recurrence. Chemotherapy and radiation are not effective treatment options. A vaccine is available that helps shrink the size of the tumor, which may prolong your dog’s life expectancy.
"
"Fibrosarcomas are common, fast-growing malignant tumors in dogs. Most are on the trunk and legs and vary in appearance and size. Those under the skin’s surface appear lumpy, while those deep under the skin may be firm and fleshy.
"
"They can invade underlying muscles, but most do not spread to other areas of the body. Treatment consists of surgical removal, though complete removal may not be possible, and regrowth is common. Fibrosarcomas may also be treated with radiation and chemotherapy.
"
"Squamous cell carcinomas can be found in two places on a dog: on the surface of the skin or under a nail. Most appear as firm, raised, irregular, and ulcerated areas. Many are solitary, but areas of prolonged sun exposure may produce multiple tumors. These growths invade surrounding tissues. Some are slow to spread, while others grow more rapidly. Treatment involves complete surgical removal of the tumor along with some normal tissue.
"
"When you find a growth on your dog, have your vet do a physical exam. It’s helpful to note the location of the lesion, how long it’s been there, any changes that have occurred since you first noticed it, and whether your dog seems bothered by the growth.
"
"A sample of cells may need to be taken and evaluated under a microscope for a diagnosis. This can come from taking an impression of the surface of the growth, using a syringe and small needle to withdraw a small sample of cells in the exam room (fine needle aspiration), or surgically removing a small tissue sample (biopsy) while your dog is under local or general anesthesia.
"
"Most veterinarians evaluate impression smears or fine needle aspirates by staining the slide and examining it under a microscope in the veterinary office. Trained veterinary pathologists are available to analyze these same samples or small tissue samples to determine a diagnosis. Then your vet can determine the appropriate treatment recommendations and explain the expected outcome.
"
"Options for treatment of a growth on a dog may include:
"
"Monitoring for changes
"
"Removal by freezing or laser treatments
"
"Surgical removal of the lump with or without also removing some normal tissue
"
"Chemotherapy
"
"Radiation
"
"Keep a log where you write down when you first noticed the lumps and/or bumps, how many there are and where they are located, the size, color, and texture, whether it’s moveable or seems to be fixed to underlying tissue, and whether there is any discharge present. Take pictures and note any changes from day to day in any of these factors.
"
"Make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible and bring your log and photos along with any questions you may have.
"
"A sebaceous cyst is a smooth, raised swelling that contains sebum from the oil glands associated with hair follicles. They can become infected and inflamed and may rupture, secreting a thin, yellowish discharge.
"
"A sebaceous cyst should be observed for changes in size or material within the cyst. The cyst may break open from being scratched and release a fluid-like material. This should be gently cleaned with warm water and then allowed to dry. Any sign of infection or sensitivity in the area should be evaluated by a veterinarian for treatment recommendations and possibly surgical removal.
"
"The safest way to remove bumps from a dog’s skin is to have a veterinarian diagnose the type of bump. Then they will determine an appropriate plan for surgical removal using local or general anesthesia.
"
"Yes, a bug bite may cause a temporary swelling on a dog. These may be itchy as well. Growths are usually more defined and rarely regress but remain the same or grow larger over time.
"
"No. A belly lump may indicate a reaction to a buried suture, or rarely, a hernia of the abdominal wall. Contact your vet if your dog has a lump in their belly after being spayed.
"
"This would depend on the type of lump that it is. Many benign growths do not need to be removed. However, if the growth changes in appearance, bothers the dog, or interferes with movement, then a veterinary exam is needed to determine the appropriate treatment. For malignant growths, your vet can determine the appropriate treatment.

"If your dog has lower than normal levels of calcium in its blood, it is suffering from the medical condition known as hypocalcemia. Calcium plays an important role in vital bodily functions such as bone and teeth formation, blood clotting, milk production, muscle contraction, heart pumping, vision, and in the metabolism of hormones and enzymes. Therefore, calcium deficiency is a serious condition that requires immediate treatment.
"
"Symptoms vary depending on the underlying cause and severity of the problem. However, some of the more common symptoms include:
"
"In mild cases, no symptoms may be observed until total calcium level fall well below normal (6.7 mg/dL).
"
"Albumin is a protein found in the blood and significant fraction of calcium remains bound to albumin along with free calcium in the blood. If the level of albumin falls (hypoalbuminemia) due to some other problem or disease, it also affects the total calcium level. Although it accounts for more than 50 percent of hypocalcemia cases, low levels of calcium associated with hypoalbuminemia are not generally associated with any symptom.
"
"Hypocalcemia may also be due to:
"
"There are occasions where a laboratory error reflects hypocalcemia when in fact your dog is just fine. To verify, it is important you give a detailed history of your dog’s health, onset and nature of symptoms, and possible incidence that might have precipitated the condition. Your veterinarian will also perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all body systems to evaluate overall health of your dog. Routine tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis will provide valuable information about the blood calcium levels and information about the possible inciting cause(s) of hypocalcemia in your dog.
"
"If kidney failure is the precipitating cause of hypocalcemia, complete blood count may show anemia in dogs with chronic kidney failure. Anemia may also be present in patients with nutrition related secondary hyperparathyroidism or poor intestinal absorption of calcium in the gut.
"
"In case of infection or inflammation (like pancreatitis), the number of white blood cells may have found to be abnormally high. In some dogs with pancreatitis, amylase and lipase enzymes are also found to be elevated. In dogs with low levels of albumin (hypoalbuminemia), the biochemistry profile will show levels of albumin and disturbances in calcium levels. Meanwhile, if alkalosis is a cause of hypocalcemia, the blood gas analysis will reveal abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood of your dog.
"
"Dogs with with kidney failure ethylene, glycol toxicity, or oxalate toxicity may present abnormally high levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Phosphorous derangements are also common in conditions leading to low calcium levels and in patients with kidney problems, ethylene glycol toxicity, oxalate toxicity, and hypoparathyroidism, biochemistry profile may show abnormally high levels of phosphorous. High phosphorous levels and hypocalcemia may also be found in the blood if enemas containing phosphorous are used in patients requiring enema; in constipation, for example. Urinalysis may reveal abnormally low concentrated urine and presence of glucose in patients with kidney problems or ethylene or oxalate toxicity.
"
"To determine if the low level of calcium is responsible for the symptoms present, your veterinarian may order further testing to find the concentration of ionized fractions of calcium, which is the active form of calcium in the blood. In case of ethylene glycol toxicity, the ethylene glycol test will be performed to confirm the toxicity. Your veterinarian will draw a blood sample from a vein of your dog and will send it to the laboratory to determine the levels of ethylene glycol in the blood. Normally, the level of ethylene glycol in the blood should be zero. If hypoparathyroidism is suspected, more detailed tests to evaluate the functions of the parathyroid gland will be conducted.
"
"Radiography of the abdomen may reveal smaller than normal sized kidneys in dogs with chronic kidney failure and large-sized kidney in animals with ethylene glycol toxicity, oxalate toxicity, or acute kidney failure. Dogs with nutrition related secondary hypoparathyroidism, meanwhile, may display low bone density on bone X-rays.
"
"
"
"Generally, hypocalcemia is corrected through calcium supplementation therapy under close monitoring, so as to prevent side-effects related to calcium overload. Your veterinarian will also monitor the electrocardiogram data (EKG) because calcium has a direct effect on heart and significant calcium level changes leads to abnormal EKG findings.
"
"After intravenous calcium therapy, your veterinarian may like to continue calcium supplementation for an extended period of time to prevent relapse. In addition, severe cases of hypocalcemia may require extended hospital stays.
"
"In cases with transitory hypocalcemia, the initial calcium therapy will generally resolve the problem. However, if the hypocalcemia was due to a serious health problem, it will need to be treated further to prevent future episodes. Hypocalcemia due to nutrition and parturition (the act of giving birth) may also require further action.
"
"If your dog's hypocalcemia is related to nutrition, for example, your veterinarian will make new dietary recommendations. While bitches that have recently given birth may be separated from their puppies. In these cases, the puppies can be nursed by hand until the dog's hypocalcemia has properly been addressed.

"When the levels of albumin in a dog's blood serum are abnormally low, it is said to have hypoalbuminemia. A protein formed in the liver and carried into the blood, albumin is responsible for regulating blood volume by controlling pressure in the blood compartment. It is also important for retaining fluid in the vascular compartment. Therefore, a deficiency of albumin can pose grave risks for a dog, including dangerous fluid buildup.
"
"Hypoalbuminemia has not been found to occur at any particular age. Moreover, there are no apparent breed or gender predilections.
"

"
"Lockjaw in dogs is a rare condition that refers to the animal’s inability to either open or close their mouth. When most people refer to a dog having lockjaw, they are typically referring to tetanus, since one of the most well-known symptoms of tetanus is jaw stiffness or lockjaw.  
"
"However, there are other conditions that can result in lockjaw. Many of these conditions are connected to the function of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The TMJ acts like a hinge where the lower and upper jaws meet, so trauma or disease in the TMJ can also affect your dog’s ability to open her mouth. Lockjaw may also be caused by conditions affecting the muscles and nerves surrounding the mouth.
"
"In its simplest form, lockjaw occurs when a dog is unable to open or close its mouth.   
"
"Depending on the underlying reason for the lockjaw, there may be additional signs such as: 
"
"Drooling  
"
"Because there are so many possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.
"
"Before your veterinarian can determine an effective treatment plan, the underlying cause of the low albumin count in the blood stream will need to be conclusively identified. For example, if the cause is severe liver disease, your dog may have all of the symptoms listed. A complete blood analysis and urinalysis will help your doctor to zero in on the cause. Chest and abdominal X-rays may also be required, as well as ultrasound and liver and kidney biopsies. 
"
"
"
"Your dog's treatment will be dictated by the cause of the low albumin counts. Your dog may need to be hospitalized initially for treatment. If there is a fluid buildup in the chest, for instance, a chest tube may be inserted to relieve some of the buildup. Intravenous fluids may be required as well. Likewise, the type of medication prescribed will depend on the underlying cause of the albumin deficiency.
"
"Your veterinarian may prescribe physical therapy to include walks in order to improve drainage of peripheral swelling. A specific diet will also be planned once your dog is able to eat normally again.
"
"Your veterinarian will need to see your dog frequently in the early stages of treatment to monitor body weight and fluid buildup, and to take blood samples and monitor albumin concentrations. Making sure that the heart is functioning properly, and recovering from any stress that occurred as a result of the albumin disorder, is also essential.

"A deep wound near the jaw 
"
"An ear infection 
"
"Eye swelling 
"
"The condition that is most referred to as lockjaw is tetanus, a nerve disorder caused by infection from the Clostridium tetani bacteria. Tetanus is a condition in which the toxins produced by a bacterial infection, typically located deep in a puncture-type wound, make their way through the tissues to the nearest nerve. Clinical signs often start in this location, but can then spread through the nervous system to affect the entire body.   
"
"However, the jaw can be locked open or closed for a variety of reasons, including:  
"
"Fractures or disorders of the TMJ 
"
"Diseases of the muscles around the TMJ   
"
"Nerve disorders 
"
"Non-tetanus infections 
"
"Birth defects 
"
"Cancers 
"
"Inflammatory conditions like masticatory myositis 
"
"Perhaps the simplest cause of lockjaw is when the dog bites down on something that wedges between its molars (like a stick), preventing the dog from closing its mouth. This is particularly common among large-breed dogs that like to carry heavy objects in their mouths. 
"
"Diagnosis of lockjaw depends on the underlying condition causing it. When a dog comes into a veterinarian office with its mouth open and drooling heavily, most vets will immediately look in the back of the mouth for a stick or an item lodged in the dog’s mouth. 
"
"Some conditions, such as tetanus and masticatory myositis, may be diagnosed based on a physical examination alone.  
"
"Problems involving the TMJ joint such as malformation, trauma, and injury will likely need an exam under sedation as well as radiographs (x-rays).  
"
"When infections, inflammation, or cancer are suspected—or when the overall health status of the dog is in question—a complete blood count and biochemistry panel are usually ordered. 
"
"The complexity of the testing will vary based on the underlying diagnosis and may range from a diagnosis based on a physical examination to one based on lab results.
"
"The treatment of lockjaw varies depending on the dog’s diagnosis.
"
"Some conditions involving the TMJ can be addressed surgically, while simple inflammatory problems may respond to anti-inflammatory medications.  
"
"Time and physical therapy can help resolve lockjaw in some cases. In other more serious cases such as tetanus, an extended hospital stay might be required.   
"
"Whatever the underlying cause, the quicker a dog receives an accurate diagnosis, the better the chance at a simpler resolution. 
"
"Because lockjaw has many different causes and treatments, there is no home remedy to treat it. Your dog may have something stuck in the back of its mouth, so it is worth checking if you can do so without injuring yourself or the dog. However, once a diagnosis has been reached, your veterinarian may be able to show you physical therapy exercises to help your dog at home.
"
"There is not a specific breed disposition to lockjaw, but dogs that frequently carry items in their mouth—particularly heavy items‚ are more likely to injure themselves or wedge something into the back of the mouth in the process. Some breeds are more prone to masticatory myositis, which can lead to lockjaw. This includes the German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Weimaraner, King Charles Cavalier Spaniel, as well as several other large-breed dogs.

"In terms of lizards, the Gila Monster and the Mexican Beaded Lizard are the only ones to be seriously concerned about. These lizards live almost exclusively in the American Southwest and Mexico.
"
"While Gila Monsters and Mexican Beaded Lizards are normally docile and do not often attack, it is important to be aware of the danger if a bite does occur. These lizards have a tendency to bite hard, and not let go. In order to remove it, use a prying instrument to open the lizard's jaws. It has also been found that a flame held under the lizard’s jaw will cause it let go.
"
"These lizards have about forty teeth, which are grooved and not attached to the jaws very firmly, to allow them to be broken off and  regrown throughout their lives. There are two glands in the back of the lower jaw, where the venom is stored in a pocket next to the outside teeth and then released through a duct when the lizard bites. The venom is then projected along the grooves of the teeth and into the victim. Salivation increases with the intensity of the anger of the lizard; when that occurs, the amount of venom injected in the victim also increases. Statistically, venom from bites will be deposited into a dog about 70% of the time.
"
"The venom of the two lizards is very similar. However, in contrast to the venom of most snakes, it does not have an anticoagulant effect. Even so, it has been shown to be just as potent as some rattlesnake venoms in lab tests.
"
"Blood analyses, urinalyses, X-rays and ultrasound results will usually come back normal, so a veterinarian does not usually order these. However, they may recommend an EKG to check for abnormal heart rhythms. He will probably also check your dog’s blood pressure. But the only definitive way to diagnose lizard toxicity is by analyzing the venom.
"
"
"
"The dog must be taken to a veterinarian if you suspect it has been bitten by one of these lizards. The veterinarian will then prescribe treatment and medications. Pay close attention to the wound and report any changes. Most importantly, if you live in an area where these lizards are likely to roam, place your dog behind a fence capable of keeping the lizards out.

"The liver is the largest gland in the body, and one of the most important organs for the overall health of the body. It serves many vital functions, like production of bile (the fluid substance that helps in fat digestion), production of albumin (a protein present in blood plasma), and more importantly, the detoxification of chemicals and drugs that pass through the body. 
"
"Hepatotoxins are toxic substance that can damage the liver. Some toxins are known for having properties that can bring about liver damage and that almost always lead to liver toxicity. However, an individual dog may be more likely to develop liver toxicity symptoms that are related to a particular drug than another dog might under seemingly similar circumstances. This type of reaction is called an ""idiosyncratic reaction"" and can sometimes lead to unpredictable injury.
"
"In comparison to other organs, the liver is more susceptible to adverse toxicity reactions due to its location and to its central role in the metabolism of toxic chemicals and drugs. Liver toxicity is most commonly associated with adverse drug reactions.
"
"The severity of the liver toxicity is also determined by age, nutritional status, concurrent diseases, hereditary factors, other drugs being used, and previous exposure to the same or similar drugs. The extent of the liver injury also depends on drug concentration, duration and frequency of drug exposure, and current liver health status. 
"
"Dog breeds including Dalmatians, Dobermans, Samoyeds, Labrador retrievers, German shepherd dogs, and herding breeds show increased vulnerability to certain drugs. Though liver toxicity can occur in dogs of any age, young dogs are more susceptible to adverse drug reactions and liver damage due to their immature liver metabolism functionality and excretory functions.
"
"Hepatitis is a condition in which the liver is inflamed, creating a diseased state. Further complicating this condition is the growth of inflamed tissue on the liver, a condition that is then referred to as hepatitis granulomatous (where a granuloma is a small area of inflamed tissue). This condition is most commonly due to fungal infection, but it can also be brought about by bacteria, viruses, parasites, or cancer.
"
"Hepatitis granulomatous is relatively uncommon in dogs, but it is not limited by age or breed.
"
"  
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms, including any illnesses your dog has had, even if they have apparently resolved. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The results of the blood tests may reveal abnormalities related to the underlying disease/condition.
"
"The biochemical tests usually reveal abnormally high liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, low glucose levels, and other such abnormalities. Similarly, the urinalysis may reveal protein, red blood cells, or white blood cells in the urine, indicative of infection. As the liver is important for blood clotting, abnormalities related to blood clotting are common in these patients. However, a coagulation check may return normal, unless your dog has reached the point of liver failure.
"
"Abdominal X-rays will often reveal an enlarged liver, an abdominal mass, and excess fluid inside the abdominal cavity. An abdominal ultrasound will give your veterinarian further details related to the liver size and also enable your veterinarian to take a guided biopsy of liver tissue for further microscopic evaluation. The liver tissue sample will confirm abnormalities in the liver tissue, providing the means for a definitive diagnosis.
"
"It is important to keep in mind that hepatitis granulomatous is frequently multisystemic, meaning that several systems of the body are being affected, making the diagnosis difficult to define.
"
"
"
"Depending on the severity of the symptoms, your dog may needs to be hospitalized for initial treatment. Fluid therapy will be given to restore bodily fluid deficits, along with nutritional support if your dog is unable to eat. As the underlying cause of this disease is often difficult to diagnose, treatment can be highly variable and will depend on the underlying cause.
"
"Because of the liver's importance to the body whole, the prognosis for this disease is guarded to poor. Cirrhosis, liver failure, or a chronic condition may develop as the result of hepatitis granulomatous.
"
"It is not always possible to diagnose the underlying cause of this disease, therefore, successful treatment is often difficult to achieve. Due to this fact, the condition often worsens and may lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. The prognosis is often poor because of involvement of multiple systems of the body, the difficulty in diagnosing the underlying cause, and the ability to provide proper treatment without a definite diagnosis.

"
"Symptoms can vary depending on the duration of drug exposure and the type of toxin. The following symptoms may be observed in dogs with liver toxicity:
"
"Loss of appetite
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Jaundice (often progressive)
"
"Weakness
"
"Fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites) - this symptom is often indicative of advanced disease
"
"Coma
"
"Hemorrhages
"
"Petechia (minute red or purple spots on the surface of the skin as the result of tiny hemorrhages of blood vessels in the skin)
"
"Ecchymosis (the escape of blood from ruptured blood vessels into the surrounding tissue, forming a purple or black-and-blue spot on the skin)
"
"Drugs
"
"Toxic chemicals
"
"You will need to give a detailed history of your dog’s health, onset and nature of symptoms, and possible conditions that might have led to this condition, such as prior health condition, any medications your dog has been on, etc. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all of your dog’s body systems and to evaluate your dog’s overall health.
"
"Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These test results should allow your veterinarian to make an initial diagnosis. The biochemistry profile will reveal abnormally high levels of liver enzymes due to liver injury if toxicity is present.
"
"Creatine kinase, an enzyme in the tissues, will show increased levels in the blood in cases with severe muscle damage, and as certain chemicals are toxic to the muscles, its levels are also determined in animals with liver toxicity. In patients with liver toxicity, the blood protein albumin may also show increased levels. The urinalysis may indicate high levels of glucose (sugar) in the urine if kidney damage is also present. 
"
"Because the liver also performs a pivotal role in blood clotting, in cases of liver damage the normal blood clotting functions may be disturbed. For this reason your veterinarian will likely order a complete blood clotting profile test for your dog.
"
"Abdominal X-rays and ultrasonography may be used to evaluate the size of the liver along with the extent of damage. Your veterinarian may also need to take a sample of liver tissue for a liver biopsy in order to confirm the diagnosis and estimate the level of damage. Your veterinarian will require three to five days to assess a realistic prognosis of liver damage in your dog, so that you will have some ideas on how you will want to progress with available treatments.
"
"In case of advanced liver damage, your dog will need to be hospitalized for intensive therapy. Intravenous fluid therapy is required for patients with deficient body fluids to maintain hydration status. In case of abnormal blood clotting functions, your dog will be given fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma (a normal fluid component of blood).
"
"Oxygen will be given to improve the delivery of oxygen to liver tissue, and urine output will be monitored to access the normal functions of the kidneys. In case of low blood sugar, intravenous fluids containing sugar will be administered. Antibiotics can be given to protect your dog against infections, and vitamins are also given for maintaining the liver’s metabolism functions. Intensive care is usually required for at least 3-10 days for initial stabilization.
"
"Liver damage is a serious health problem, and you will need to provide your dog with a quiet and comfortable environment so that your dog can recover and properly rest. Patients with liver damage usually have a low body temperature, so you will need to keep your dog in a warm environment to prevent further aggravation of normal body functions.
"
"Special dietary support is generally prescribed for these patients, as a supportive and well-balanced nutritional diet is essential for energy levels and a successful recovery. If your dog is not able to eat, your veterinarian will use a stomach tube to feed the dog until it is able to start eating on its own. Your veterinarian will demonstrate the proper use and cleaning of the feeding tube for home care.
"
"Follow-up evaluations of your dog will include laboratory tests to evaluate the current liver functions and efficacy of ongoing treatment. Other than the drugs that have been prescribed by your veterinarian, do not give your dog any medications during or after the recovery period, unless you have been specifically advised to do so by your veterinarian. The already damaged liver will be very vulnerable for some time after treatment, and will need to be treated with great care. Failure of this organ leads to certain death.  
"
"Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the extent of the initial liver damage. In some patients liver damage is permanent and may lead to complete liver failure.

"Hepatitis, a medical condition used to describe long-term, ongoing inflammation of the liver, is associated with an accumulation of inflammatory cells in the liver and progressive scarring or formation of excessive fibrous tissue in the liver (fibrosis). These biological changes can lead to decreased functioning of the liver.
"
"Another cause for hepatitis, inherited copper-storage disease of the liver, occurs in Bedlington terriers and other breeds. The average range of onset is from two to ten years, with average age of occurrence around six years old. In cocker Spaniels, it is more common in males, but otherwise, copper storage disease of the liver appears to have a higher incidence in females than in males.
"
"You will need to provide your veterinarian with a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Any information you have about your dog's genetic background and parentage will be helpful as well.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. The bloodwork will enable your veterinarian to look for impaired kidney function.
"
"The appearance of the liver will change in certain diseased states. Your veterinarian will use X-ray and ultrasound imaging to visually examine the liver and may use the opportunity to take a tissue sample for biopsy.
"
"
"
"If your dog is severely ill it will need to be hospitalized and given fluid therapy supplemented with B vitamins, potassium and dextrose. Your dog's activity will need to be restricted during the treatment and recovery phase. Talk with your veterinarian about whether cage rest is the best option. The dog will also need to be kept warm.
"
"Medication to increase elimination of fluids from the body will help to decrease fluid build-up in the abdomen, and medications may also be prescribed to treat infection, decrease brain swelling, control seizures, and decrease ammonia production and absorption (from the intestines to the rest of the body). Enemas can be used to empty the colon. Zinc may also be supplemented if necessary.
"
"Your dog should be switched to a diet restricted in sodium, and supplemented with thiamine and vitamins. Rather than two or three main meals per day, you will need to feed your dog several small meals a day. If your dog is suffering from a lack of appetite that continues over several days, you will need to talk to your veterinarian about using an intravenous feeding tube. This should be done to assure that your dog does not suffer further from muscle wasting.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments according to your dog's underlying disease state. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your dog's symptoms return or worsen, if your dog loses weight, or if your dog begins to show a poor body condition.

"Intrahepatic arteriovenous (AV) fistula is a congenital based condition that is uncommon in most cats and dogs, but it can also develop through surgical injury, trauma, and abnormal tissue or bone growth (neoplasia). When it occurs abnormal passages develop between the proper liver (hepatic) arteries and the inner liver (intrahepatic) portal veins.
"
"This acute illness can be addressed with fair results when a proper diagnosis has been settled on. Most treatment will be on an outpatient basis and will include a planned diet, dietary restrictions, and long term observation.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Dogs that suffer from AV fistula may show lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, excessive thirst (polydipsia), dementia, and abdominal swelling. There are several other signs of AV fistula, such as: 
"
"There is not a breed that shows a higher predisposition than another. Hepatic AV is a vascular (vessel) malformation that is genetically determined during the embryonic stage of development, also referred to as embryologic anlage. Most conditions present in young dogs, but in some cases, surgical injury, traumas, or tumor growth (neoplasia) can lead to the problem.
"
"The disorder can be tested by using complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry, and urinalysis techniques; coagulation tests, abdominal (peritoneal) fluid analysis, evaluation of bile acids (digestive secretion from the liver), X-rays, ultrasounds, liver biopsies, and exploratory laparotomies (incision into the abdominal wall) are other exams that may help diagnose the liver malformation.
"
"The inflammation of the liver is known as hepatitis. Sometimes bacterial infections affecting the liver may involve the formation of abscesses containing pus. It also may accompany inflammation of the bile duct, the presence of stones in the gallbladder, necrotic (dead tissue) spots of the liver, and the formation of many small abscesses. Single abscesses may be present due to a tumor which becomes infected over time. Liver abscesses are more common in older dogs and patients with diabetes.
"
"Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, will be conducted after your veterinarian records a detailed history and performs a complete physical examination of your dog. The results of these tests are informational, especially in identifying potential infections. For example, an increased of white blood cells (leukocytosis), abnormally low levels of platelets (cells involved in blood clotting), and anemia may be evident in blood testing. The biochemistry profile, meanwhile, may indicate abnormally high levels of liver enzymes, and abnormally low levels of glucose (hypoglycemia). And radiographic and ultrasonography studies may reveal an enlargement of the liver and are integral in detecting the presence of mass(es) and abscess(es).
"
"Additionally, a small sample from the affected area can be taken through a special needle and processed further to see the type of infection. Your veterinarian will culture the sample to identify the type of bacterial infection, which helps find the most suitable antibiotic for the infection in your dog. If the bacteria are isolated, culture and sensitivity testing will be conducted to find the type of bacteria involved and types of antibiotics these bacteria are sensitive to.
"
"
"
"In the case of severe infection, your dog may need to be hospitalized for intensive care and treatment. Intravenous fluids are started along with antibiotics to cover fluid deficits and infection respectively. Your veterinarian may also decide to drain the abscess to help in the resolution of the infection. Drainage of the abscess may be carried-out under ultrasound guidance, though in some dogs, abdominal surgery may be required.
"
"While some pets will require surgical care, most can be treated at home with nursing care. Modifications to the diet will often include restrictions on nitrogen intake and sodium. Hydration and electrolyte disturbances will also be addressed and treated. Drugs that rely on liver biotransformation should be avoided, along with any drugs that will react with GABA-benzodiazepine receptors (the transmitters that inhibit anxiety and over excitement). Veterinarians will commonly prescribe histamines for blood pressure reduction, and diuretics (furosemides) to relieve excess fluid.
"
"It is important to monitor the biochemistry of the dog every few weeks, and then every few months following the initial treatment routines. Prognosis is fair for the dog when it is properly treated, although the dog will require ongoing monitoring and treatment to address any health issues that may arise.
"
"As the health issue is mostly congenital in nature, there are no preventative measures to consider.

"
"In addition, the veterinary surgeon may pass a small tube down to the infected area, leaving one end outside to help in continuous drainage of pus material. This tube can be removed once the drainage of the material stops and the infection is resolved.
"
"During treatment, your veterinarian will monitor body temperature, liver enzymes, number of white blood cells (to see status of infection), and evaluate the liver with ultrasound.
"
"Follow the guidelines given by your veterinarian. Call your veterinarian if you observe any untoward symptoms in your dog. You may need to check the temperature of your dog on daily basis and record it for your veterinarian to see the progress of treatment. Good diet management and rest are required for your dog during the recovery period. Timely diagnosis and treatment usually resolve the problem in most cases.

"Juvenile fibrosing liver disease is a noninflammatory liver disease which causes excessive extracellular matrix proteins to deposit in the liver tissue (also known as liver firbosis). It is typically seen in young or juvenile dogs, especially large breeds. If left untreated, a dog with this disease may develop cirrhosis and liver failure.
"
"Although the cause to the fibrosis remains uncertain, chronic exposure to toxic bile, exposure to intestinal toxins, and liver injuries may be a factor.
"
"Juvenile fibrosing liver disease is often associated with chronic exposure to gastrointestinal toxins. However, it may also relate to hemorrhagic gastrointestinal illnesses (portal endotoxemia) in young dogs.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. In some dogs, liver enzyme levels are found to be abnormally high in biochemistry panels, while the urinalysis may reveal the presence of ammonium bicarbonate crystals in the urine.
"
"Abdominal ultrasonography will help in determining the structure and size of liver, but a liver biopsy may be required for detailed analysis of the liver tissue. If right-sided heart disease is suspected, your veterinarian may recommend performing echocardiography. Your veterinarian may also take a sample of the dog's abdominal fluid for further analysis, or conduct routine coagulation tests to rule out blood coagulation disorders.
"
"
"
"Cases in which there is severe liver disease or hepatic encephalopathy, immediate hospitalization is required. Treatment, however, is typically focused on addressing the various complications related to juvenile fibrosing liver disease. For example, dogs with fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites) will be prescribed medicines such as diuretics to enhance fluid loss. Similarly, dogs with urinary stones may require medication to resolve that issue. Antibiotics, meanwhile, are used to treat infections, and vitamins are added to the diet to improve overall health of the dog.
"
"The prognosis for the dog will largely depend upon the level of fibrosis and liver damage. Although fibrosis may continue with advancing age, long-term success is possible if diagnosis and treatment occur in a timely fashion. Regular laboratory testing, including liver biopsies, will be required to monitor your dog's progress and status of the disease. If the fibrosis should recur, the dog may require further hospitalization.

"The liver is a very important organ that removes waste products from a dog’s body, absorbs and produces proteins and clotting factors, eliminates toxins, and aids in metabolism and digestion.
"
"Because it has so many functions it’s more susceptible to damage, and inflammation (swelling) can occur, known as hepatitis. This leads to death of liver cells, loss of function, and eventual liver failure.
"
"The liver has the unique ability to regrow after damage, but if the damage is excessive, this makes it difficult to regenerate. Many diseases can result in liver failure when more than 70% of the liver becomes damaged.
"
"Liver failure in dogs is a medical emergency. This condition is painful and can result in death. 
"
"Dogs with end-stage liver failure (cirrhosis) often die within one week of diagnosis. Dogs with accompanying ascites, or fluid buildup in the abdomen, have a poorer prognosis overall.  
"
"Fortunately, some causes of liver failure can be healed if diagnosed and treated early enough by a veterinarian.
"
"Several symptoms of liver disease in dogs are nondescript and can be seen with almost any type of disease. They include:
"
"Weakness
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Increased thirst and urination
"
"Weight loss
"
"Abdominal pain
"
"Vomiting with or without blood
"
"Diarrhea with or without blood
"
"However, if a progressive loss of liver function leads to liver failure, the following symptoms may occur:
"
"Jaundice
"
"Bruising on the skin, nose, and eyes
"
"Bleeding from the nose, mouth, rectum, and bladder
"
"Black, tarry stools
"
"Ascites
"
"Swelling of the limbs (edema)
"
"Collapse
"
"Hepatic encephalopathy
"
"Hepatic encephalopathy causes neurologic signs such as head pressing, seizures, circling, behavioral changes, lack of coordination, blindness, or coma
"
"There are many causes of liver failure in dogs, and it’s often frustrating for veterinarians to diagnose. Sometimes the initial cause may never be found.
"
"However, there are several known causes of liver failure. These include:
"
"Medications such as Tylenol® (acetaminophen)
"
"Heavy metals like copper
"
"Toxins such as blue-green algae, mycotoxins (usually through eating moldy or spoiled food), xylitol, sago palm, rodenticides
"
"If you suspect your pet has consumed a toxin, call the Pet Poison Hotline (855-764-7661) for advice.
"
"Infectious organisms such as infectious canine hepatitis, leptospirosis, histoplasmosis, or heartworm disease (specifically end-stage caval syndrome)
"
"Cancer
"
"Inherited conditions such as copper storage disease, often seen in Bedlington Terriers and West Highland White Terriers; amyloidosis, seen in breeds like Shar-Pei
"
"Portosystemic shunts, usually a congenital issue
"
"Since symptoms of liver failure in dogs can be vague, vets rely on diagnostics such as bloodwork and urinalysis as well as a physical exam.
"
"Your vet may recommend additional blood tests, as well as X-rays, ultrasound, and abdominocentesis. In this procedure, a needle is inserted to collect fluid to look for evidence of infection or cancer in dogs.
"
"Additionally, your vet may need a sample of your dog’s liver to make an accurate diagnosis. This sample can be taken either through surgery or through a biopsy, where a needle is put directly into the liver.
"
"Liver biopsies have risks, and they are usually done once the patient has been stabilized.
"
"Treatment of liver failure in dogs is most effective if started early. This is very important for dogs with acute liver failure  because they often come to the vet in critical condition.
"
"The goal of treatment is to slow the disease and allow time for the liver to regrow. Supportive care to relieve the symptoms alongside treatment of the underlying cause may involve several medications, including:
"
"SAMe and milk thistle derivatives (silymarin)
"
"N-acetylcysteine
"
"Vitamin K1
"
"IV fluids (blood transfusions or plasma transfusions may also be needed) with electrolyte and glucose supplementation
"
"Pain medications
"
"Antacids, anti-nausea medications (famotidine, ranitidine), and gastroprotectants like sucralfate
"
"Because the liver helps with digestion and metabolism of nutrients, a diet that requires less work for the liver can be helpful.
"
"Prescription diets such as Hill’s® l/d, Royal Canin® Hepatic or Purina® HP Hepatic are formulated to have more digestible protein, contain more antioxidants, and have lower amounts of certain minerals like copper that can be harmful to the liver.
"
"At first, feeding tubes may be needed to deliver nutrients to a dog. Speak with your vet for advice on the best diet for your individual pup.
"
"Protein restriction is important in dogs diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy or at risk of developing it.
"
"Dogs with hepatic encephalopathy may also be helped by enemas, lactulose, and antibiotics like neomycin or metronidazole. Periodic abdominocentesis may be needed to help ease symptoms and improve comfort and breathing.
"
"In cases of cirrhosis, symptomatic care is directed at slowing its progression, managing complications, and keeping a good quality of life for as long as possible.
"
"For some dogs with advanced disease or poor outlook of recovery, humane euthanasia may be recommended by your vet.
"
"Because the liver has a unique ability to regrow, dogs can have a good prognosis and go on to live a normal life with some diseases that are caught early and treated aggressively.
"
"However, chronic liver disease may occur secondarily. That can lead to frequent rechecks and lifelong medical and dietary management, but dogs may still have a decent quality of life. This typically occurs in cases of leptospirosis and if your dog has eaten certain toxins.
"
"Not all causes of liver failure in dogs can be prevented. However, there are some ways to decrease risks, such as:
"
"Keep garbage securely put away and out of your dog’s reach
"
"Keep all medications locked up
"
"Remove any toxic plants from the yard and inside the home
"
"Block access to chemicals and toxins, like rodenticide
"
"Vaccinate your dog against leptospirosis and infectious canine hepatitis.
"
"Take steps to avoid sources of possible bacterial contamination by restricting access to standing water, avoiding contact with wildlife, and using pest control as needed.
"
"Speak with your veterinarian about the risks and benefits of certain medications for your dog.
"
"It usually takes a few days for symptoms of liver failure to develop, since the liver can continue working until a large portion of it becomes damaged. But once symptoms appear, it’s very important that your dog gets veterinary attention quickly.

"
"A dog’s liver plays a central role in their body.
"
"However, the liver is also vulnerable to many issues that can threaten a dog’s health. It’s important for pet parents to understand the causes and symptoms of liver disease to keep their pup happy and healthy.
"
"Liver disease is a blanket term applied to many conditions that cause the liver to malfunction or stop working properly.
"
"These conditions typically cause inflammation and/or damage to the liver. This can be a primary problem with the liver itself or secondary to other medical conditions. 
"
"A dog’s liver has many functions. It removes toxic substances from the blood, helps break down medications, processes energy, stores vitamins and glycogen (stored form of glucose), makes bile to aid in digestion, and creates important proteins needed for blood clotting.
"
"Because the liver has many purposes, liver disease can present different symptoms depending on the function affected. This condition often impacts other systems in the body.
"
"One of the most common symptoms of liver disease is jaundice, which causes a yellowish coloring to appear in a dog's eyes, gums, skin, and ears.
"
"The liver is responsible for discharging bilirubin, a by-product from the breakdown of red blood cells. When the liver isn’t functioning normally, this bilirubin builds up in the blood and leads to jaundice in dogs.
"
"Hepatic encephalopathy is a secondary condition to liver disease. This condition encompasses a group of neurologic (related to the nervous system) symptoms that occur in dogs with liver disease. These symptoms include seizures, disorientation, depression, head pressing, blindness, or behavioral changes.
"
"Other common symptoms of liver disease include gastrointestinal signs, such as:
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Weight loss
"
"Increased drinking
"
"Increased urination
"
"Changes in stool color, such as gray or yellow stool
"
"Fluid retention in the abdomen (ascites)
"
"Your vet will recommend diagnostic tests to look at your dog’s liver function and determine the cause of their liver disease.
"
"Commonly recommended tests are blood work, abdominal ultrasounds, X-rays, and urinalysis (a urine test that looks for a wide range of illnesses).
"
"There are many different conditions or illnesses that can result in liver disease in dogs.
"
"These can be primary (due to an issue with the liver itself) or secondary (another condition or disease which is affecting the liver). These conditions often result in inflammation or damage to the liver. 
"
"In young pups, one of the most common liver disorders is a birth defect called congenital portosystemic shunt or “liver shunt”.
"
"When this occurs, a blood vessel bypasses the liver, causing a buildup of toxins. Congenital portosystemic shunts are often found in young dogs who have stunted growth, developed seizures, or are disoriented.
"
"Acquired shunts is more common in older dogs, which develop when there’s a blood pressure backup in the liver due to high blood pressure (hypertension) or cirrhosis. To get around the blocked section, new vessels grow to bypass the area.
"
"A dog’s treatment depends on the size and location of the shunt(s). If it consists of one large vessel outside of the liver (this is more common with congenital shunts in small breed dogs), surgery may be successful.
"
"Shunts inside the liver or those with many vessels may not be fixed with surgery. If this happens and the liver disease can’t be cured, your vet will focus on managing the condition. Your dog must be given a low protein diet and medications to help decrease the toxins in their blood.
"
"Certain diseases that affect the endocrine glands—which control the body’s hormones—can lead to liver issues. Diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing’s disease), and hyperthyroidism can all cause impaired liver function.
"
"If your pup is impacted by one of these diseases, your vet will focus on treating the underlying endocrine disease. This is the most important part of improving liver function.
"
"Because all blood passes through the liver, it’s vulnerable to infectious (contagious) diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi.
"
"The most common viral disease associated with dogs’ liver is canine hepatitis, an infectious condition that can cause inflammation and scarring of the organ. This is a vaccine-preventable disease.
"
"Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that can lead to liver disease, though many associate it with kidney disease. Dogs are infected with leptospirosis through contaminated water sources, and the disease can be spread to humans. Leptospirosis can be difficult to diagnosis and even with treatment may result in permanent secondary liver and kidney damage. 
"
"Coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis are the most common fungal causes of liver disease. Dogs are exposed through inhaling or ingesting the spores in the environment, such as when hiking in areas with these fungi.
"
"These infections can be difficult to cure and often need to be treated with anti-fungal medications for months. Because of the difficulty in treating fungal disease of the liver, the long-term prognosis is guarded.
"
"Dogs are prone to several types of liver masses. 
"
"Liver cysts can be present from birth, though some dogs may get them as they age. While cysts are often benign (non-cancerous), large or growing cysts can cause symptoms of liver disease. The surgical removal of these large cysts typically cures a pup’s liver issues.
"
"Cancer of the liver comes in two main forms—the less common primary tumors, originating in in the liver, and metastatic (secondary) tumors, which spread from another area in the body.
"
"Primary tumors are less common than metastatic ones. Depending on the type of cancer, location, and number of masses, treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination of treatments.
"
"Certain breeds of dogs are predisposed to specific liver conditions. Copper storage disease is a known problem in Bedlington Terriers, Doberman Pinschers, Skye Terriers, and West Highland White Terriers.
"
"These breeds may have a metabolic defect that causes copper to remain in the liver, leading to chronic hepatitis. Amyloidosis, caused by a abnormally-formed protein that builds up in the cells, is a disease of Shar-Peis.
"
"If your pet is experiencing any of the clinical signs above or is jaundice, your vet will likely want to start with bloodwork. 
"
"A serum chemistry panel will help assess your dog’s liver values and guide the veterinarian if liver disease is a concern. 
"
"Additional testing may include advanced blood tests such as liver function tests or screening tests for Cushing’s or hyperthyroidism.
"
"Your vet may also recommend abdominal X-rays or an abdominal ultrasound to better visualize the liver and check for abnormalities. Your pup may potentially need a sampling or biopsy of their liver. 
"
"Depending on the severity of the disease and whether the underlying cause can be treated or cured, the outcome of liver disease in dogs can vary.
"
"If treatment starts before long-term damage occurs, a dog’s prognosis can be successful. The liver can regenerate and repair itself, which often means acute or mild to moderate liver disease has a good prognosis. 
"
"Chronic or severe liver disease, however, has a poorer prognosis. If a pup is diagnosed with these conditions, treatment is limited to managing the progression of the disease and minimizing symptoms.
"
"The most common medical management of liver disease may include:
"
"A higher carbohydrate (carb) and low-protein diet to decrease the amount of ammonia (a waste product) in the bloodstream
"
"Vitamin supplements
"
"Lactulose, to bind toxins in the gut
"
"Antibiotics
"
"Vitamin K, if a dog has bleeding issues
"
"Your vet should monitor your pup regularly if they have liver disease, as they can help manage your dog’s symptoms. This can extend the length and quality of their life.
"
"When liver disease is chronic or severe, your vet may discuss with you if your pet has a good quality of life and if they are likely to improve, even with intensive treatment. Liver disease can be fatal in those cases. 
"
"Not all cases of liver disease can be prevented, but certain precautions can reduce the risk of specific diseases.
"
"Discuss with your vet which diseases (such as Leptospirosis) your pet should be vaccinated for and if you live in an area with high risk of fungal or other types of infections.   
"
"It’s important to understand and recognize the signs of liver disease. If you notice anything concerning about your pup, see your vet as soon as possible.
"
"Early diagnosis and treatment is one of the key factors in curing liver disease and preventing serious illness in your furry companion.
"
"Chronic or severe liver disease can be fatal in dogs. However, with early and aggressive therapy, liver disease can be successfully treated. The liver can then repair itself. 
"
"Depending on the underlying cause of the liver disease and severity, dogs may be able to live for years with liver disease, but it can also be acutely fatal.
"
"If your pet has elevated liver values on bloodwork, talk to your vet about the possible causes and prognosis for your pet.  
"
"Liver disease can be painful and can also lead to nausea and lack of hunger in dogs.
"
"If your pet has liver disease, talk to your vet about the appropriate medications to keep your pup comfortable and happy for as long as possible.

"
"Like many organs, the liver and gallbladder are susceptible to cancer. While a dog can have either liver cancer or gallbladder cancer, the unique location and function of these organs means that many dogs have cancer affecting both organs at the same time.
"
"The liver is an important organ that is involved in metabolism and filtering blood. It produces and stores many important components for digestion and blood clotting. The liver works with the gallbladder, which stores the bile the liver creates for digestion.
"
"Dog livers have six lobes, with the gallbladder nestled between them. The liver and gallbladder sit in the abdominal cavity under the diaphragm and next to the stomach and pancreas.
"
"Veterinarians class these types of tumors as:
"
"Benign (non-cancerous)
"
"Malignant (cancerous)
"
"Primary (originated in the liver)
"
"Secondary (spread from another tumor somewhere else)
"
"Focal (located in one area)
"
"Diffuse (spread throughout the entire organ)
"
"Benign liver tumors are non-cancerous but are easy to confuse with malignant tumors. When veterinarians find any tumor in the liver, they may recommend additional tests to rule out more sinister diseases. Benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body and do not pose a risk of metastasis. Many benign tumors may still be removed and dogs can have a good prognosis, if caught early. Benign tumors and lesions can be focal (located in one area or lobe) or diffuse and spread throughout multiple lobes. Examples of benign liver and gallbladder tumors include:
"
"Hepatocellular adenoma
"
"Hepatoma
"
"Nodular hyperplasia
"
"Bile duct adenoma
"
"Hemangioma
"
"While the prognosis for benign tumors is typically good if discovered early, the same is not true for malignant, cancerous tumors. The outcome for malignant tumors varies, based on how aggressive the cancer is in the dog. Malignant tumors can be primary, meaning it is a solitary cancer that may eventually spread to other sites. It may also be diagnosed as secondary which is metastasis from a distant tumor that has spread to the liver and gallbladder through the lymphatic system, blood vessels or direct invasion. Examples of malignant primary liver and gallbladder tumors include:
"
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (this is the most common primary malignant liver tumor)
"
"Cholangiocellular carcinoma
"
"Hemangiosarcoma
"
"Histiocytic sarcoma
"
"Fibrosarcoma
"
"Hepatic carcinoid
"
"Lymphoma
"
"Secondary malignant liver tumors are more common than primary malignant liver tumors. Other types of primary cancer, easily spread to the liver as secondary malignant tumors, include:
"
"Lymphoma
"
"Intestinal carcinoma
"
"Renal carcinoma
"
"Mast cell tumors
"
"Hemangiosarcoma
"
"Islet cell carcinoma
"
"Exocrine pancreas carcinoma
"
" 
"
"Clinical signs of liver cancer in dogs can be difficult to assess, nonspecific or even absent. If your dog does show signs of illness, symptoms may include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Low blood sugar, which may look like weakness, poor coordination or dullness
"
"Weight loss
"
"Ascites (abnormal fluid in the abdomen)
"
"Increased thirst
"
"Increased urination
"
"Enlarged liver
"
"Abdominal pain
"
"Jaundice or icterus (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes)
"
"Collapse and acute shock due to tumor rupture
"
"The definitive causes of this type of cancer are largely unknown. Genetics may play a role. Female dogs may be more prone to bile duct carcinomas, while male dogs may be more prone to hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocellular carcinoma may be more frequent in dogs with chronic inflammation or liver damage. German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers have a higher prevalence of hemangiosarcoma.
"
"Veterinarians may feel the tumor or fluid during an abdominal exam. They may also see a yellowing of the mucous membranes. A definitive diagnosis of liver or gallbladder cancer requires additional diagnostics.
"
"A complete blood count of a dog with liver or gallbladder cancer may reveal a decreased red blood cell count and changes to the platelets. The blood chemistry may reveal changes secondary to liver and gallbladder cell damage, bile stasis and liver insufficiency. Commonly, veterinarians see an elevation of liver- and gallbladder-specific blood values. Severity of blood changes doesn’t necessarily correlate with severity of disease, in all cases.
"
"Bile acid tests assess the functioning of the liver and the results may be abnormal in dogs with liver cancer. The tests compare the bile acid level before and after a fatty meal to determine how well the liver is functioning and processing bile acids. Dogs with impaired liver function cannot process bile acids normally, resulting in high test results.
"
"The liver plays an active role in coagulation or clotting of the blood. Changes in liver function can directly impact the dog’s ability to clot normally.
"
"Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by young, regenerating or malignant liver cells. It is used as a marker of severe liver disease but doesn’t provide a definitive diagnosis of a specific type of cancer.
"
"Radiographs are useful to determine the overall size, shape and placement of the liver in reference to other abdominal organs. X-rays may allow visualization of obvious masses in the liver and other organs as well as abnormalities like calcification of abdominal contents. Veterinarians will also want to take X-rays of the lungs to look for a cancerous spread.
"
"Ultrasonography allows a more detailed analysis of the internal structure of the liver and other abdominal organs. Veterinary radiologists evaluate the entire abdominal cavity for other tumors, abnormalities and fluids. Veterinarians will also use ultrasound as a guide when they obtain biopsies, which is one way to get a definitive diagnosis.
"
"MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and CT (Computerized Tomography) scans help determine the location, size and severity of cancers within the abdominal cavity. They can sometimes suggest a certain type of cancer based on certain features on the scans. Advanced imaging is helpful in staging for surgery to allow full visualization of the tumor and how it interacts with the normal structures in the abdomen.
"
"Veterinarians use surgery to remove tumors or take biopsies of a tumor that cannot be removed completely through surgery. Typically, a dog will already have had blood work, X-rays and ultrasound, at a minimum, before surgery.
"
"Surgery is the treatment of choice in dogs with primary tumors of the liver or gallbladder. Surgery is generally not an option for secondary tumors, because this typically indicates the cancer spread is too advanced throughout the body.
"
"The liver has amazing regenerative properties, so a dog can have a significant portion of the liver removed and still retain or regain function.
"
"Tumors localized to just one liver lobe are easier to remove than tumors affecting multiple lobes. Veterinarians can also fully remove the gallbladder if necessary. Often, the location and type of tumor requires removing both the gallbladder and parts of the liver.
"
"Before surgery, a complete work-up (cancer staging) should be performed to look at overall health and cancer spread. This may include blood work, X-rays of the chest, and an ultrasound of the abdomen. Based on the findings of these tests, vets will determine if a patient is a good candidate for surgery.
"
"Dogs may be candidates for chemotherapy after removal of a liver and gallbladder tumor, or in unresectable tumors. Chemotherapy may also be an option to treat more advanced malignant secondary tumors.
"
"No medication will cure liver or gallbladder cancer. However, some supplements, like S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAMe) and Silybin (milk thistle) can help support the liver in regaining and protecting its function.
"
"Based on the diagnosis, a prognosis of liver and gallbladder cancer may vary. Benign tumors typically have a good prognosis. If the tumor was found coincidentally, and if the pet is not actively sick, dogs may have an excellent full-life expectancy.
"
"Patients who have additional secondary conditions may have a more guarded prognosis. Malignant and secondary tumors carry a more guarded-to-grave prognosis, based on the type of malignancy. In general, large single cancers carry a better prognosis than cancer that spreads to multiple nodules throughout the liver. Surgical resection can be curative, and life expectancy may be a few years.
"
"Mesenchymal and neuroendocrine tumors have a worse prognosis than hepatocellular, with life expectancy of a few weeks to months. Gallbladder cancer has a high metastatic (spread) rate and is, in general, more difficult to remove than liver tumors.
"
"Not all tumors can be removed. When they are not removed, tumors may grow so large that they rupture. Liver tumors tend to be fragile and vascular. When they rupture, dogs typically display:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Collapse
"
"Pale gums
"
"Increased heart rate
"
"It is essential to seek veterinary care immediately if your dog is displaying any of these signs.
"
"Recovery and management of liver and gallbladder cancer in dogs varies based on the treatment performed and type of tumor. It commonly involves addressing all symptoms including supplements for liver function, antibiotics for infections and blood products to help coagulation, if needed. Dogs who have partial liver removal may require more aggressive post-operative treatment, while dogs who have their gallbladder removed may only require low-fat diets.
"
"After surgery, a dog will require normal post-operative care relative to incision monitoring and routine pain management. The dog will likely have an incision from the sternum down to the pelvis.
"
"These patients should have decreased activity and incision monitoring for at least 10 to 14 days. Re-checks with surgeons and oncologists may be scheduled initially at two weeks and then every one to three months going forward, depending on the plan. Veterinarians will likely check bloodwork parameters, X-rays and ultrasounds at visits to monitor disease progression and quality of life.
"
"Depending on the type of cancer, some dogs can live years after diagnosis. However, in more severe cases, the survival rate is much lower.
"
"Depending on the specific disease, dogs with liver cancer may feel lethargic, appear nauseous and have a tender abdomen.
"
"Depending on the type, liver cancer can progress in a matter of weeks or years.
"
" 
"
"If you are a pet parent, chances are you have heard of lipomas, or at least their common name, fatty tumors. They are extremely common growths that are most often found in the tissue layers below a dog’s skin.
"
"Lipomas in dogs are benign, noncancerous tumors that grow from fat cells. They are more common in overweight dogs and are more likely to develop as a dog ages.
"
"Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinchers, Miniature Schnauzers, Cocker Spaniels, Dachshunds, Golden Retrievers, and Weimaraners develop more than their fair share of lipomas, but any breed can develop them.
"
"The main symptom of a lipoma is a lump or mass that you can feel just underneath your dog’s skin. You can usually define the borders of a lipoma relatively easy, though their shape can vary from round to oval to somewhat irregular and more bulbous.
"
"They usually feel somewhat “squishy,” or fluctuant, though they can be firmer in texture. They can be firmly stuck in place if they are adhered to the surrounding tissues, or you may be able to move them around to some degree.
"
"Lipomas can be found in just about any spot on (or in) a dog, but most are found on the pet’s abdomen and chest. Many lipomas are also found on a dog’s legs, but no location is off limits, including the organs inside a dog’s body.

Lipomas in dogs might start small, but their growth knows no limits. When they grow so large that they become heavy or outgrow their blood supply, they present problems from pain to necrosis. They can also cause problems with a dog’s mobility depending upon their location.
"
"Because lipomas in dogs can appear and feel similar to other dangerous and malignant tumors, it is essential to get an accurate diagnosis of the mass.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend a noninvasive test known as a fine-needle aspirate and cytology exam. This is a diagnostic procedure where a needle is inserted into the mass for a sampling of cells.
"
"The veterinarian will then stain the cells on a microscope slide and examine them under the microscope. This is a quick and safe test.
"
"Typically, lipomas have oily material and fat cells that are easy to identify under the microscope. Taking a biopsy with a larger tissue size is essential to confirm that the mass is a lipoma, as it allows for a much more comprehensive examination of the mass. 
"
"Lice are parasites that live on the skin of an affected dog. They are actually a small insect that feeds by chewing on the skin of the dog or by sucking the blood, depending on the type of louse. Left unchecked, they can grow to be an infestation on the dog’s body. Dog lice are not as common as dog fleas, and are most often seen in situations where sanitary practices are poor.
"
"Symptoms seen in infested dogs include:
"
"There are two species of lice that infest dogs:
"
"Both types of lice can be passed directly from one dog to another through direct contact or through contact with contaminated objects, such as grooming utensils or bedding.
"
"Lice are species-specific. They do not move from one species to another. That means that you cannot get lice from your dog nor can your dog get human specific lice from you.
"
"Diagnosis is easily made by visually observing lice or their nits (eggs) in the hair. Adult lice are flat, six-legged insects with no wings. Nits can be seen attached to the individual hair shafts and appear as small white dots.
"
"There are a wide variety of shampoos, as well as insecticidal sprays and powders that are effective in killing lice. In addition, products such as fipronil and selamectin can also be used. (They come in various brand names.) It may be necessary to treat your dog more than once to kill the developing nits as they hatch. Follow your veterinarian’s directions closely, as these products can be harsh on some dogs, especially puppies.
"
"In cases where your dog’s fur is badly matted, it may be necessary to shave the fur to be sure of getting to the deeper lice and their nits.
"
"To prevent reinfection, dispose of or wash all of your dog’s bedding, as well as thoroughly cleaning all of the places your dog spends time. Some items that cannot be laundered or washed down may be sealed tightly in plastic bags for a few weeks. Disinfect all grooming utensils and anything else your dog comes into contact with regularly, such as crates, and of course, all of the furniture, rugs, carpeting and hard flooring.

"
"Sometimes these fatty tumors turn out to be malignant lipomas (called liposarcomas), even though they look and feel like their benign counterparts.
"
"It is important to have an accurate diagnosis and to know that the mass is indeed a lipoma, but at this point, most lipomas require only monitoring. There is usually no reason to treat lipomas, as they pose no threat to your pup unless they are uncomfortably large or in an awkward location.
"
"The growth of most lipomas is slow, alleviating the pressure to make a hasty decision about surgical removal if you are on the fence. Lipomas that are larger or invasive into surrounding tissue may be appropriate candidates for surgical removal. More rapidly growing tumors may also be suitable for surgical removal.
"
"A less common type of lipoma, named an infiltrative lipoma for its classic behavior of infiltrating nearby tissues, can make surgery more problematic, as delineating the borders can be challenging and recurrence is likely.
"
"If you and your veterinarian opt for a conservative approach of monitoring your dog’s lipoma versus surgical removal, pay careful attention to monitoring the size and growth rate of the lipoma.
"
"Record the size at least every six months and document it with photos and measurements. You can take pictures with your cell phone to record these growths. Lipoma growth is gradual, and many lipomas have been known to sneak up in size until they are as big as a basketball or even larger.

Always look for changes in the size, shape, or firmness, and check the integrity of the skin covering it. If your dog becomes irritated by the lipoma, this is a reason to rethink having the mass surgically removed.  
"
"Maintaining your dog at a proper weight (and instituting a weight-loss plan as needed) will usually help control the growth of lipomas and prevent future ones. Some lipomas will shrink with weight loss but not disappear altogether.
"
"Overall, the outlook after the diagnosis of a lipoma is generally great and no cause for alarm.
"
"Lipomas can shrink with weight loss, but they do not go away entirely on their own. Surgery is not usually needed, but it is often effective in removing them. However, they may return in another area.
"
"No, but lipomas can cause problems for dogs depending on their location. For instance, a lipoma surrounding the heart can have fatal consequences, though most often, they are found in the tissue underneath the skin.
"
"Sometimes removal of a lipoma is necessary, and other times it is not. As they grow larger, they can cause problems, such as tissue necrosis or discomfort for the dog.
"
"Lipomas are traditionally slow-growing tumors. If you find a mass that seems to have appeared overnight, it is unlikely to be a lipoma.

"Canine leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, the soft inner portion of bones. Bone marrow has the important job of creating white blood cells, those that help the body fight off infection and disease.
"
"Leukemia results when bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cells that do not fully develop or function properly. They eventually begin to outnumber healthy blood cells, accumulate in the bloodstream, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, and may stop bone marrow from producing healthy blood cells altogether.
"
"There are two main types of canine leukemia: chronic and acute.
"
"Chronic leukemia: Chronic leukemia progresses slowly and steadily over time. Abnormal white blood cells in chronic leukemia are almost fully developed and can perform their normal functions, but not as well.
"
"Acute leukemia: Acute leukemia progresses much faster than chronic leukemia. It causes a high production of immature blood cells that cannot function properly. It is typically accompanied by severe symptoms.
"
"Chronic and acute leukemia can be characterized as either myelogenous leukemia (originating in the bone marrow’s myeloid cells) or lymphocytic leukemia (affecting the lymphoid cells), depending on which type of white blood cell is affected. Lymphocytic leukemia is more common than myelogenous leukemia in dogs.
"
"Lethargy
"
"Lack of appetite
"
"Fever
"
"Weight loss
"
"Nausea
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Increased urination
"
"Recurrent infections
"
"Increased intake of water
"
"Enlarged abdomen, from enlarged liver and/or spleen
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes
"
"Keep in mind that dogs with chronic leukemia may not show any symptoms because it progresses so slowly.
"
"Canine leukemia has no known direct cause. Rather, a dog’s risk of developing leukemia is determined by a mix of different factors.
"
"Chemical exposure: Some toxins, such as the industrial chemical benzene, have been linked to causing leukemia in humans. This may also be the case for dogs.
"
"Genetics: All blood cells in the body begin as stem cells. The stem cell has a set of instructions on what it should become and how it should function. Sometimes, this set of instructions is damaged and results in the creation of an abnormal blood cell that does not function properly.
"
"Breed: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is diagnosed most often in Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds. The reason why is unknown, but it is likely related to genetics.
"
"Age: Younger dogs are more likely to be diagnosed with acute leukemia than middle-aged and older dogs.
"
"Gender: Gender does not appear to play a role in the risk of developing leukemia in dogs. Both males and females are equally likely to be diagnosed with the disease.
"
"A blood test is first performed to determine the relative number of white blood cells in your dog’s body. A high white blood cell count is an indicator that something may be wrong.
"
"Several diseases can cause an abnormally high level of white blood cells. Your veterinarian will do additional tests to rule out other diseases, even if they suspect leukemia. These tests may include a physical examination, examination of the red blood cell count, and taking samples of your dog’s spleen, liver, or bone marrow.
"
"Samples for the determination of leukemia are typically taken from bone marrow using a bone marrow aspirate. A bone marrow aspirate involves the use of a specialized needle to penetrate the bone and collect fluid. Your veterinarian may also do a core biopsy, where a solid piece of bone marrow is collected. Dogs need to be sedated or given light general anesthesia to reduce discomfort during the procedure, and your dog needs to be kept still to ensure a good sample is taken.
"
"These samples are examined under a microscope to determine if cancerous cells are present. This is most often when a diagnosis is made.
"
"Once diagnosed, the presenting symptoms, a dog’s age, and the age of the cancerous blood cells can be used to determine whether the leukemia is chronic or acute.
"
"Many dogs with chronic leukemia are older, do not show any symptoms, and exhibit cancerous white blood cells that are more developed. A diagnosis is typically made during routine blood work.
"
"Dogs with acute leukemia are typically under 6 years of age, show signs of being sick, and have cancerous cells that are less developed. A diagnosis is usually made while seeking treatment for severe symptoms.
"
"Leukemia in dogs is rarely cured with treatment. Rather, treatment is used to manage symptoms, extend lifespan, and increase a dog’s quality of life. Dogs with chronic leukemia typically respond well to treatment.
"
"Supportive care for your dog may include administering antibiotics, replenishing lost bodily fluids, supplementing your dog’s body with important blood components, and feeding them a well-balanced and healthy diet.
"
"Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of both may be used to help slow down the disease. Dogs with acute leukemia have very few treatment options and commonly do not respond well to chemotherapy.
"
"Chemotherapy is typically given by mouth in pill form. More severe cases may require that chemotherapy be delivered through the bloodstream. Some chemotherapy drugs may work better than others, depending on your dog’s specific situation.
"
"Medications that suppress the immune system may be prescribed to minimize negative side effects associated with cancer and cancer treatment. Blood transfusions may be required due to a low number of healthy red blood cells.
"
"Dogs in earlier stages of chronic leukemia may not be given immediate treatment. Close observation and regular veterinary visits will determine when treatment should start as the disease progresses
"
"Achieving remission, where the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or disappear entirely, is extremely rare with leukemia. Disease and symptom management are key for extending the lifespan and quality of life for your dog post-diagnosis.
"
"Medications will likely be prescribed for the long-term. These may include immunosuppressants such as prednisone and chlorambucil.
"
"Pet parents should ensure that their dog is eating a balanced and healthy diet. A multivitamin such as Zesty Paws® 8-in-1 Bites may be helpful if your dog is struggling to retain important nutrients due to their cancer and cancer treatment.
"
"Supplements with scientific evidence of their cancer-fighting abilities, such as omega-3 fatty acids, can be added to help further boost your dog’s diet. Nordic Natural Omega-3 Pet Softgels may be recommended by your veterinarian.
"
"Pet parents should also be prepared to make lifestyle changes. This may include altering daily routines to accommodate a dog’s reduced energy levels, administering scheduled medications, and monitoring overall body condition. Financial planning for the cost of treatment may also result in lifestyle changes.
"
"Always consult with your dog’s veterinarian before making any changes in your dog’s treatment plan. This helps ensure that you’re supporting your dog in the best was possible.
"
"A dog diagnosed with acute leukemia has a life expectancy of only weeks to months, even with supportive care and treatment. A dog diagnosed with chronic leukemia has a life expectancy of several months to years.
"
"The final stages of leukemia are marked by lethargy, labored breathing, limited mobility, severe weight loss, difficulty eating and drinking, and incontinence.
"
"Diagnosing leukemia in dogs can cost $500 to $2,000. Oral chemotherapy used for leukemia costs about $100 to $350 per treatment, while intravenous chemotherapy costs about $1,000 per treatment. Keep in mind that care and costs will be extensive because leukemia cannot be cured.
"
"Chronic leukemia develops over the course of months to years before it is even detected. Acute leukemia progresses very quickly—within weeks to months—and exhibits severe symptoms.

"Leptospirosis is a disease that affects dogs and other mammals, including humans. It’s caused by a type of bacteria characterized as a spirochete, named for its spiral shape.
"
"Dogs can become infected with leptospirosis in several ways, including contact with infected urine, urine-soaked soil or bedding material, water containing the bacteria, open wounds, bites, reproductive fluids, and even ingestion of infected tissues.
"
"It can also be transmitted from mother dog to puppy through the placenta.
"
"Leptospirosis is considered a medical emergency.
"
"Once infected, the bacteria travel through the bloodstream, causing widespread inflammation and eventually settling in the kidneys and sometimes the liver or other organs, causing inflammation, pain, and ultimately organ failure.
"
"From the kidneys, the bacteria are emptied into the environment through the urine.
"
"Common carriers of leptospirosis include wildlife such as raccoons, skunks, opossums, and rats, as well as farm animals like cows and pigs.
"
"Take extra precautions when traveling or living in rural areas. Additionally, leptospirosis is considered a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans.
"
"If you suspect your dog may be infected, contact your veterinarian right away and avoid contact with your dog’s bodily fluids, especially urine.
"
"Once infected, dogs typically begin to develop symptoms within a week. These symptoms can vary from mild to severe, and some dogs may recover spontaneously. Common symptoms include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite and eventual weight loss
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Fever
"
"Pain
"
"Edema (swelling of the limbs or abdomen)
"
"Bruising
"
"Bleeding from the gums
"
"Blood in the urine, stool, or nose
"
"Muscle pain, stiffness, and reluctance to move
"
"Jaundice, characterized by yellowing of the eyes, gums, or skin
"
"Changes in thirst and urination
"
"Oral ulceration and bad breath
"
"Difficulty breathing and coughing
"
"Uveitis, often manifesting as cloudy or red eyes with squinting
"
"Dehydration
"
"Sudden miscarriage (in pregnant dogs)
"
"Leptospirosis is found throughout the United States and other countries, particularly in warm and wet climates.
"
"The bacteria can survive for weeks to months and easily spread through water systems such as lakes, ponds, and streams, as well as in urine-contaminated soil.
"
"Dogs who are young, unvaccinated, or have a compromised immune system are at higher risk, but the infection can affect dogs of any age, breed, and gender.
"
"Leptospirosis becomes a concern when a combination of your dog’s symptoms and results from blood work and urine testing suggest it.
"
"Often, kidney and liver values will be affected. X-rays might be recommended, especially for dogs who are having respiratory problems.
"
"Ultimately, the diagnosis of leptospirosis requires PCR testing (a test designed to find leptospirosis genetic material in a sample) of blood, urine, or both to detect the bacterial DNA, or MAT testing (a microscopic agglutination test) to measure a dog’s antibody level, or titer, against the disease.
"
"The MAT test is typically repeated after several weeks to help determine the specific strain causing the infection. There is also an in-house test that serves as a useful screening tool but should be verified with either the PCR or MAT if it yields a positive result.
"
"Be sure to provide information about any recent travel history, exposure to other dogs or wildlife, rural areas, or bodies of water frequented.
"
"This information can raise suspicion for leptospirosis and alert the medical team to the possibility of an infectious zoonotic disease.
"
"Dogs will initially need to be stabilized and treated at the veterinary hospital.
"
"Supportive care measures, such as pain medications, antiemetics (to prevent vomiting), appetite stimulants, and liver supplements such as Denamarin or SAMe, may be recommended.
"
"Fluid therapy, often supplemented with electrolytes, is necessary for treatment. IV fluids are important not only to combat dehydration but also to restore fluids lost due to vomiting and diarrhea. It also improves blood flow through a dog’s damaged kidneys.
"
"At the hospital, antibiotics like penicillin G or ampicillin will often be given as an injectable.
"
"Once symptoms are managed and the dog can eat on their own, they will be put on doxycycline, the preferred oral treatment, usually given twice a day for a few weeks.
"
"It takes about a week of antibiotic therapy before your dog stops shedding bacteria in their urine. During this time, limit interactions with your dog to a minimum and take the necessary disinfection and protective measures to prevent transmission of leptospirosis.
"
"In the hospital, your dog may have a catheter inserted to reduce the exposure risk for the veterinary team.
"
"Renal replacement therapy, also known as dialysis, is another option that can certainly improve the prognosis, especially for dogs not producing sufficient urine despite appropriate therapy.
"
"In some cases, only a few sessions may be needed.
"
"While dialysis may not always be readily available and can at times be expensive, it’s an excellent therapeutic option that should be discussed with your vet.
"
"In certain cases, humane euthanasia may be considered. These include dogs with severe kidney or liver failure, widespread hemorrhaging and an inability to clot, respiratory issues, or cases where treatment has failed to show improvement in symptoms.
"
"Depending on your dog’s response to therapy, they will likely be discharged after several days. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled in the following days and weeks to recheck blood work and ensure their kidneys (and other organs) are functioning appropriately.
"
"Fortunately, prognosis for recovering pups is generally good.
"
"However, in some cases, despite appropriate therapy, some dogs may continue to experience the lasting effects of leptospirosis, including kidney and liver issues.
"
"Long-term medications and a specific diet may be necessary, along with ongoing follow-up appointments to monitor the progression of the disease.
"
"Until you are instructed otherwise, make sure your dog urinates in an area that can be easily cleaned and disinfected, away from any water sources.
"
"When caring for your dog at home, be sure to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). 
"
"This includes face protection (goggles and mask), disposable gloves, and a disposable gown. Wear the PPE during interactions with your pup and especially when disinfecting urine-soaked areas or bathing hair that becomes soaked in urine. Properly clean and disinfect all bedding materials.
"
"Leptospirosis is vulnerable to most household disinfectants and bleach. This disease has a limited survival rate in the environment, and is susceptible to UV irradiation and desiccation (the removal of moisture).
"
"It’s important to note that dogs can become reinfected with leptospirosis in the future, so similar precautions should be taken even after recovery.
"
"Preventing leptospirosis can be challenging due to the numerous bacterial strains involved. A vaccine, given in two injections three to four weeks apart and then annually, targets several of the main strains of leptospirosis.
"
"While this vaccine significantly reduces the risk of your dog contracting the disease, it can’t completely prevent it. Additionally, vaccines can’t guarantee 100% immunity but can often lessen the severity if infection occurs.
"
"The vaccines contain various strains, some more than others, so be sure to discuss the most suitable vaccine with your veterinarian.
"
"Further recommendations include avoiding potential sources of contamination, such as limiting access to standing water, avoiding contact with wildlife, using pest control when necessary, and preventing access to garbage.
"
"Leptospirosis is a transmissible and zoonotic disease, which means other dogs and people can become infected. During treatment, don’t allow your dog to interact with others and make sure you use the proper PPE when interacting with your dog. 
"
"Frequent hand washing and good overall hygiene is necessary. Avoid allowing your dog to encounter any open wounds or share bodily fluids.
"
"Leptospirosis is found worldwide, so the risk of dogs becoming infected is quite high.
"
"With the advances in transportation, increased travel, relocation of people with their pets, the relocation of pets through shelter groups, and the occurrence of natural disasters such as flooding and hurricanes, the prevalence of leptospirosis has increased.
"
"No. Leptospirosis is an extremely debilitating disease, but survival rates are high with appropriate therapy. Treatment requires antibiotics and fluids at a veterinary hospital.

"Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease in dogs is an orthopedic condition that primarily affects young pups—typically those less than 1 year old—while they are still growing.
"
"The head of the femur—the long bone in a dog’s hind leg that connects to the hip—loses blood supply, which causes bone death and significant joint changes.
"
"This may include a flattened femur, thickening of the cartilage around the joint, and ultimately osteoarthritis.
"
"These changes are permanent and can’t be cured. This condition is very painful for dogs and results in movement issues, such as limping.
"
"Usually only one hind leg is affected, but it can affect both legs in some dogs.
"
"Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease in dogs is most common in small and miniature breeds—such as Yorkshire Terriers and Shih Tzu—although the disease is rare overall. Males and females are equally likely to be affected.
"
"This condition is not necessarily a medical emergency, but since it causes significant pain and discomfort for dogs who have it, early treatment is very important.
"
"Symptoms of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease in dogs include the following:
"
"Lameness
"
"Joint pain
"
"Stiffness when walking
"
"Reduced range of motion in hips
"
"Muscle atrophy (wasting away)
"
"Popping joint sounds
"
"Shorter affected leg
"
"Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease usually causes symptoms that get worse over several weeks. Lameness rarely occurs suddenly.
"
"The cause of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease in dogs is currently unknown.
"
"It’s thought that there may be an immune-mediated or genetic factor. Trauma or certain hormones may increase the risk of this disease, but more research is needed.
"
"A veterinarian begins with a thorough physical exam, including feeling the dog’s joints, checking range of motion, and watching the dog walk. When the veterinarian collects a history, the pet parent should mention when symptoms started and if their dog has had any recent trauma or injury.
"
"If the veterinarian suspects a joint issue, an X-ray will be taken of the affected limb. This is a relatively quick test where radiation is used to create detailed pictures of the leg bones. Some dogs may need sedation to help them stay still and calm for radiographs.
"
"If a dog has Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, the X-ray will show changes to the top of the femur that sits in the hip joint, such as deformed areas, breaks, or osteoarthritis. The patella (kneecap) may also be positioned abnormally.
"
"In mild cases of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease in dogs, pups will be treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Metacam®, and will have an exercise restriction for two months.
"
"Dogs should be prevented from running, jumping, or bearing any weight on the affected leg. Pet parents may need to use a sling to help the dog walk for potty breaks.
"
"Pet parents should be aware that the disease may get more severe and later need surgery if starting with  oral medications.  
"
"Surgery may be needed to fix the affected leg, especially in severe cases. A type of surgery called a femoral head and neck ostectomy can be done to remove the diseased part of the femur so that it is no longer part of the hip joint. The hip joint can be described as a ball and socket, and this surgery removes the ball (head of the femur) while leaving the socket (part of the hip).
"
"This surgery is typically done only for small-breed dogs. It’s not generally done for overweight dogs, as the extra weight puts unwanted stress on this unstable joint during recovery. A total hip replacement would be a better choice for large-breed or overweight dogs since the entire joint is replaced, providing more stability.
"
"After surgery, physical therapy is needed to make sure scar tissue forms well enough to stabilize the joint, and that the dog’s mobility returns.
"
"Recovery is a slow process as scar tissue must form to stabilize the hip joint. This can take two to three months.
"
"It’s important that pet parents bring their dog to all follow-up appointments, including physical therapy sessions, to make sure the joint is healing well.
"
"If surgery was done, a recovery collar should be used to keep your dog from chewing at the incision (cut). Pet parents should follow their veterinarian’s instructions closely to make sure their dog is comfortable during recovery.
"
"Pet parents should not allow their dog to run or jump during recovery. A short leash should be used for potty breaks, and dogs should not be allowed to play with other pets while they recover.
"
"The outlook for most dogs is generally good following treatment.
"
"However, it’s common for dogs to develop osteoarthritis in the affected limb.
"
"For this reason, many dogs need long-term medications to control pain and inflammation (swelling). Options may include Previcox®, Metacam®, Rimadyl®, or gabapentin. Dogs with osteoarthritis benefit from orthopedic dog beds to cushion their joints as well.
"
"Unfortunately, this Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease in dogs is not preventable because the exact cause is unknown.
"
"Pet parents should mention any walking or movement abnormalities, such as limping or stiffness, to the veterinarian promptly for the right diagnosis and treatment.
"
"If the disease does happen, early intervention will lower its severity and promote a better outcome for the affected dog.

"Lead poisoning (toxicity), a condition in which increases levels of the metal lead is found in blood, can afflict both humans and dogs through both sudden (acute) and long-term (chronic) exposure to the metal. Through the ability to substitute itself for calcium and zinc (both important minerals for normal cell functions), lead damages the cell and affects normal biological processes.
"
"Although a high number of lead poisoning cases are seen during the warmer months of the year, there is a wide variety of sources of lead -- many of which vary between different geographical and ecological locations. Older homes and buildings, for instance, are common sources of lead poisonings, as they can be riddled with lead dust or chips from lead paint.
"
"Lead poisoning is more common in young animals and in dogs living in poor areas. However, cats also succumb to lead poisoning.
"
"The symptoms for lead poisoning mostly relate with the gastrointestinal (GI) and central nervous system (CNS). GI systems, for example, are seen with chronic and low-level exposure, whereas CNS symptoms are more common in acute exposure in young animals. Some of the more common symptoms include:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health leading up to the onset of symptoms, including a history of any contact with material containing lead, if possible. After recording your dog’s history, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination. Laboratory tests will include complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- the results of which may reveal valuable information for initial diagnosis.
"
"Blood testing may reveal red blood cells of unequal size (anisocytosis), abnormally shaped red blood cells (poikilocytosis), variations in red blood cell coloring (polychromasia, hypochromasia), and increased number of neutrophils (type of white blood cells). Urinalysis results are often non-specific and in some patients, abnormal concentrations of glucose may be seen in urine.
"
"If your dog is showing all of the appearances of lead poisoning, your doctor will use more specific tests available which will help your veterinarian to determine the levels of lead in both blood and body tissues.
"
"
"
"
"
"Lead poisoning should be considered an emergency that requires immediate care. Often, chelation therapy -- a detoxifying therapy whereby chelating agents are given through the mouth to bind the lead found in the gastrointestinal system and prevent further absorption -- is the first course of treatment. There are many types of chelating agent available for various types of poisonings, and selection of chelating agent will be made by the attending veterinarian.
"
"Your veterinarian may also perform a gastric lavage to remove and clean the stomach contents if the lead has been ingested within hours of medical care. This method uses water to wash, clean and empty the stomach cavity and digestive tract of poison.
"
"There are also some drugs available that can help in lowering the body load of lead, especially in cases where concentrations of lead in blood are very high. Other symptoms will be treated accordingly.
"
"Most dogs recover within 24 to 48 hours after initial treatment. Prognosis in affected animals is positive if treated quickly; however, dogs with uncontrolled seizures have a more guarded prognosis.
"
"Because humans and other animals are at risk from the same source of lead, your veterinarian is required to report the incident to relevant authorities. You may need to identify the source of lead to prevent further human or animal exposure. If source of lead is not identified and eliminated, future episodes are not uncommon and may pose greater risks.
"
"Often the best way to prevent this type of poisoning is to remove materials and objects containing lead from your home.

"Urolithiasis is the medical term referring to the presence of stones in the kidneys, bladder or anywhere in the urinary tract. Struvite -- the primary composition of these stones -- is a material that is comprised of magnesium, ammonium and phosphate. The stones are more common in female dogs than in male dogs, and typically in animals that are mid-range in years (six to seven years of age). Struvite stones account for more than one-third of all stones found in the urinary tracts of dogs.
"
"While some dogs may not display any symptoms, others have urinary problems such as:
"
"Moreover, increased thirst (polydipsia) is usually associated with stones present in the kidneys. If there is a substantial amount of inflammation, the bladder could be enlarged. Sometimes, you'll be able to feel the actual stones through the skin with your hand.
"
"There are several known risk factors including high levels of steroids, an abnormal retention of urine, and extremely non-acidic (alkaline) urine. These type of stones are also more common after urinary tract infections or disorders. Some breeds of dogs are more prone to stuvite stones, including:
"
"X-rays and ultrasounds are usually used to determine the size, shape and location of the stones, and to properly assess treatment options.
"
"
"
"Dietary management, in association with antibiotic treatment, has been effective at dissolving struvite stones. If dietary management is used, follow it explicitly and eliminate other foods and treats until the animal has fully recovered.
"
"The process of dissolving stones usually takes between two weeks and up to seven months. If the stones do not begin to dissolve after a few weeks, surgery may be necessary.
"
"X-rays and ultrasounds are used to assess the progress of the stone dissolution. A dietary regimen can also be prescribed.
"
"In some cases, restricting the diets of the animal -- in terms of magnesium -- has proven effective for stone prevention.

"The larynx is a tubular structure at the top of the windpipe (trachea). It is also known as “voice box” because it produces sound as air moves past it. In addition to sound, the larynx works with the epiglottis (a flap of cartilage covering the airway during swallowing) to prevent food from entering the trachea.
"
"Laryngeal paralysis occurs when the muscles contract to open the airway stop functioning properly. This can prevent the larynx from opening and closing normally.
"
"There are several types of diseases that can affect the larynx, such as:
"
"Certain diseases like laryngitis or edema are more likely to occur in younger dogs, while other conditions such as a laryngeal tumor or laryngeal paralysis are more common in older pets.
"
"Diseases that affect the airway can be life threatening. A dog should be taken to a veterinarian immediately if they have:
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Bluish or purple tongue/gums
"
"Facial swelling
"
"Health Tools
"
"Lactic acid is a chemical produced by the muscles during normal physical activity, and which is elevated during exercise in order to fuel the body and maintain energy. In a normal functioning body, the liver and kidneys maintain the balance between lactic acid production and its removal from the body. When the body is not functioning at normal capacity and lactic acid is not being adequately removed, a condition called lactic acidosis can occur.
"
"Lactic acidosis refers to the abnormal build-up of lactic acid in the body. This abnormal build-up can affect the cardiac system, including the heart and eventually all organ systems in the body. The recommended treatment will be dependent upon the underlying medical condition that is causing the lactic acid to build-up.
"
"Common symptoms can include heavy breathing, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Persistent lactic acid in the body will affect heart function and output and can have a tremendous impact on organ function. Most signs of lactic acidosis refer to the underlying cause of the medical condition and not the actual condition.
"
"One of the primary causes of lactic acidosis is an insufficient amount of oxygen in the blood, or poor use of oxygen by the body. Young dogs are at a higher risk for developing the condition, and they are also more likely to go into traumatic shock as a result of having it. Older animals are more likely to develop kidney (renal) failure, heart failure, liver disease, cancer, anemia, or vascular disorders.
"
"Your veterinarian's primary objective will be to determine what is causing the lactic acid build-up in the body. A series of blood tests will used to locate the cause of the condition, as well as to determine what the treatment will be.
"
"
"
"Lactic acidosis is often severe, requiring aggressive therapy. Prescribed treatment by your veterinarian will be dependent upon the location of the underlying medical cause. The ability of your dog's body to clear lactis acid will be a reasonable indicator of the therapy's success, and will determine your dog's ability to survive and recover from the condition.
"
"To increase the odds of a healthy recovery, it is important to observe your dog's ongoing response to treatment. There are some potential complications to lactic acidosis, including the development of multiple organ failure, and a higher mortality rate.

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"A significant increase in panting or loud breathing is often the first symptom noted in dogs with laryngeal paralysis. The symptoms of this disease tend to be gradual, but the pet parent might also notice:
"
"An increase in panting during stress or on hot/humid days
"
"Noisy panting
"
"Exercise intolerance/lethargy
"
"Voice change
"
"Anxiety
"
"Coughing or gagging when eating or drinking
"
"Respiratory distress
"
"Heat stroke
"
"Dark red, purple or blue gums
"
"Collapse
"
"Symptoms usually start mildly but will grow progressively worse. A dog will generally start with increased panting behaviors. Dogs with laryngeal paralysis are more prone to overexertion and overheating in warmer and humid environments, as they are not able to effectively cool themselves through panting. This can lead to heat stroke, respiratory distress or even collapse and death.
"
"The condition can develop at any age due to a congenital defect, but it more commonly develops in older giant- and large-breed dogs, especially Labrador and Golden Retrievers, St. Bernards, Irish Setters, and Newfoundlands.
"
"Laryngeal paralysis of both hereditary and acquired forms usually worsen slowly. The partial obstruction in the airway interferes with the amount of oxygen a dog can take in, eventually leading to shortness of breath.
"
"Over time, a dog will become anxious, causing it to breathe faster (but not more efficiently). This can lead to respiratory distress and even death.
"
"If you notice symptoms of heavy breathing, respiratory distress, excessive panting even in cool environments, a swollen face or gums have changed to blue or purple in color, take your dog to a veterinarian immediately.
"
"Laryngeal paralysis is a condition in which the muscles that open the larynx/voice box do not function properly. Generally, this is due to a degenerative disease of the nerves and muscles.
"
"Laryngeal paralysis can be an inherited disorder, but it is more commonly seen as an acquired condition. It is also thought to be a symptom of a larger neurologic condition called Geriatric Onset Laryngeal Paralysis Polyneuropathy (GOLPP).
"
"In time, dogs with GOLPP may have other symptoms of other neurologic weaknesses such as rear leg weakness, and their esophagus may become distended (megaesophagus), which causes difficulty swallowing and sending food down the esophagus to the stomach.
"
"Dogs with this condition are typically 10 years of age or older. Less commonly, laryngeal paralysis can be caused by nerve damage that impacts the larynx. This can be from trauma, like a dog bite, a deep wound or from a cancerous lesion in the area.
"
"To diagnose laryngeal paralysis, your veterinarian may sedate the dog to visualize its larynx and the functionality of the cartilage/muscles when they open and close.
"
"In a normal larynx, both sides of the larynx will open and close widely on one breath. In a dog with laryngeal paralysis, the larynx will sit unmoving in a semi-open position.
"
"Your veterinarian is likely to recommend thorough diagnostic testing that includes a complete blood panel, thyroid testing and neck and chest X-rays/radiographs. Radiographs are important to diagnose other potential causes of coughs and to determine if there are any side effects of laryngeal paralysis such as aspiration pneumonia — an infection that occurs in the lungs after food or stomach contents are accidentally breathed into the lungs.
"
"Additional diagnostics or a referral to a specialty hospital may be needed for advanced treatment.
"
"Laryngeal paralysis is typically treated by surgery in which two permanent sutures are used to hold one half of the larynx open to allow for easier passage of air. This is called a laryngeal tie-back surgery or Unilateral Arytenoid Lateralization (UAL).
"
"An incision is made on the side of your dog’s neck to access the larynx for the placement of sutures. The success rate of laryngeal tie-back surgery is very high.
"
"Less common surgical options may be available as well, and should be discussed with your veterinarian.
"
"Until surgery can be performed, there are a few things you can do to help your dog feel better:
"
"Avoid collars around the neck. A harness will help avoid any external pressure on the larynx
"
"Avoid heat and make sure your dog is in a cool well-ventilated environment
"
"Limit activity
"
"Reduce anxiety
"
"If your dog is experiencing respiratory distress, your veterinarian may intubate your pet by placing a tube down its throat to ensure sufficient oxygen is getting to the lungs. Intravenous (IV) fluids may also be needed to decrease your dog’s temperature.
"
"Recovery after laryngeal tie-back surgery is similar to other anesthetic procedures. For example, exercise will be restricted for several weeks. In addition, dogs that have had the procedure should not be allowed to swim for the rest of their lives to avoid the risk of breathing in water.
"
"Coughing or gagging is initially normal while eating or drinking, but tends to resolve over time. The pet parent should be aware of the symptoms of food/water aspiration, which is the most common complication of this surgery. Approximately 25 percent of dogs will have aspiration pneumonia at some point after surgery.
"
"Complications from degenerative nerve/muscle conditions such as GOLPP are possible. Please monitor your dog closely for vomiting, gagging or regurgitation, as these can be a symptom of megaesophagus. Your dog should also be monitored for hind leg weakness, and if noticed, notify your vet immediately.
"
"The lifespan for dogs with this condition depends on the type of laryngeal paralysis diagnosed and any complications that arise. Many dogs can live several years after diagnosis.
"
"Complications of laryngeal paralysis can be fatal. It is very important for the pet parent to monitor their dog for respiratory distress and have them seen immediately should any of those signs arise.
"
"Unfortunately, laryngeal paralysis cannot be cured. Fortunately, most dogs do well with medical and surgical treatment.
"
"The estimated cost for laryngeal surgery depends on the type of surgery done, and is generally in the $3,000 to $6,000 range. Cost factors include the dog’s size, individual needs and how ill they are prior to surgery. Medical workups and diagnostic imaging and additional testing can greatly impact the cost. Your geographical location will also affect costs as they follow trends related to cost of living in your area.

"Drug-induced nephrotoxicity refers to kidney damage induced by medication administered for the purpose of diagnosing or treating another medical disorder. It is more commonly recognized in dogs than cats. And although drug-induced nephrotoxicity may occur in dogs of any age, older dogs are more susceptible.
"
"Signs associated with nephrotoxicity may include:
"
"Nephrotoxicosis can be induced by the administration of pharmacologic agents (or drugs), which interfere with the blood flow to the kidneys as well as cause tubular dysfunction in the kidneys. If left untreated, the damage to the renal tubule cells may lead to tubular necrosis and even kidney failure. Risk factors that may increase the odds of developing drug-induced nephrotoxicity include dehydration, advanced age, and fever.
"
"When drug-induced nephrotoxicity is suspected, a veterinarian will often biopsy a portion of kidney tissue. This will help him or her identify kidney failure and also the proper course of treatment. Another useful diagnostic procedure is a urine analysis.
"
"
"
"Most dogs with drug-induced nephrotoxicity will require inpatient care, especially those that are also suffering from kidney failure. In these severe cases, surgery may be required.
"
"Once the dog has returned to your home, it is important that his activity be reduced and that you provide him with a modified diet that is not excessive in protein and phosphorous. Dehydration is a common threat for dogs with kidney problems; you will need to monitor him for any untoward symptoms and advise your veterinarian if they should occur, who may assist by administering fluid therapy.
"
"Electrolyte panels may be performed as frequently as every one or two days in order to evaluate the severity of azotemia, a condition commonly associated with drug-induced nephrotoxicity, in which abnormal levels of nitrogen-containing compounds (such as a number of body-waste compounds) are found in the blood. This is of utmost importance, as dogs with severely progressed azotemia may develop acute kidney failure within days.
"
"Moreover, drug-induced nephrotoxicity may even lead to chronic kidney disease months or years later. Therefore, if any signs of illness -- such as vomiting or diarrhea -- recur, contact your veterinarian immediately.
"
"The best way to prevent this type of toxicity is to not use nephrotoxic drugs. However, if your dog requires this type of medication, administer it only under the advisement of your veterinarian. You should also consult him or her before adjusting the dosage and the possibility of adverse drug interactions.

"Nephrolithiasis is the medical term for the condition in which clusters of crystals or stones -- known as nephroliths or, more commonly, “kidney stones” -- develop in the kidneys or urinary tract. The kidney is composed of thousands of nephrons, each consisting of blood capillaries and a series of tubes through which filtered fluid flows as urine is produced. The tubes of the nephron drain into ducts through which urine flows; these ducts eventually enter the renal pelvis and a tube through which urine follows into the ureter. Kidney stones or kidney stone fragments can also pass through this system of tubes and into the ureter, causing serious complications. 
"
"Both dogs and cats are susceptible to kidney stones. However, some breeds of dog are more susceptible to certain types of kidney stones than others. For example, kidney stones containing calcium and oxalic acid (known as calcium oxalate nephroliths) are more likely to be found in Lhasa Apsos, Yorkshire Terriers, and Miniature Poodles. Kidney stones containing uric acid (known as urate nephroliths), on the other hand, typically affect Dalmatians, Yorkshire Terriers, and English Bulldogs.
"
"Many dogs with kidney stones have no apparent signs; that is, the nephroliths are often not detected until diagnostic testing is done for other medical problems. Some symptoms that may occur include blood in urine (hematuria), vomiting, recurrent urinary tract infections, painful difficult urination (dysuria), and frequent urination with small volume of production (polyuria). Other symptoms may appear but vary depending on the location and type of the stones.
"
"Note that some nephroliths may be “inactive”; meaning, they are not infected, not progressively enlarging, and not causing obstruction or clinical signs. Inactive kidney stones may not require removal, but should be monitored periodically (via urine analysis for example) for any changes.
"
"There are a number of causes and risk factors that may contribute to the development of nephrolithiasis and the development of uroliths, such as the oversaturation of stone-forming material's in the dog's urine. Other potential causes include increased levels of calcium in the urine and blood, diets that produce high (alkaline) urine pH, and recurrent urinary tract infections.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of the dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, ultrasound imaging, and urinalysis. However, in order to confirm the diagnosis, identify the mineral content of the stones, and develop a proper course of treatment, pieces of nephroliths must be retrieved for analysis. This is usually achieved by performing a procedure known as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), in which stones are broken up within the urinary tract using sound waves.
"
"[video]
"
"
"
"Many dogs diagnosed with inactive kidney stones can be treated at home with proper medication administered in order to dissolve the stones. An adjustment to the dog's diet is also necessary. These dietary changes will be dependent on the chemical makeup of the kidney stone.
"
"In severe cases, the dog may require immediate removal of the kidney stone(s) and hospitalization. There are a number of options for kidney stone removal, including surgery or ESWL.
"
"Because kidney stones tend to recur, routine monitoring is essential. Most veterinarians recommend abdominal X-rays and/or ultrasound examinations every three to six months post initial treatment. A periodic urine analysis is also frequently recommended.
"
"If your dog is predisposed to nephrolithiasis, special foods and dietary management can be effective at preventing stone formation.

"A perirenal pseudocyst is a capsule of accumulated fluid around the kidney that causes it to enlarge. However, it is not technically a cyst because it lacks a true membrane covering. This condition is rarely seen in dogs and may affect one or both kidneys.
"
"Although most dogs with a perirenal pseudocyst have a nonpainful, enlarged abdomen, some may not display any symptoms (asymptomatic). In severe cases, symptoms of renal failure may manifest.
"
"Although the exact cause of a perirenal pseudocyst is not completely understood, kidney tumors, surgeries involving the kidney, and certain types of injuries are thought to be factors for developing the capsule.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are normal unless severe renal insufficiency is present.
"
"Imaging studies, including X-rays and ultrasounds, may identify which kidney is affected. Additionally, a fluid sample from around the affected kidney may be taken for further evaluation.
"
"
"
"Perirenal pseudocysts are usually not life-threatening and some dogs need no treatment whatsoever. Otherwise, the fluid is surgically drained from the capsule, especially when the dog's abdomen is distended. There are also forms of treatment when severe renal diseases are involved.
"
"Regular follow-up examinations (every two to six months) are required to evaluate the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of the treatment. Watch your dog for untoward symptoms, such as increased thirst (polydipsia), blood in urine (hematuria), and weight loss, and inform your veterinarian of them immediately, as they may be signs of renal failure.

"The glomeruli are penetrable clusters of capillaries in the kidney that function to filter waste from the blood, establishing the formation of urine, one of the body’s main methods for disposing of waste products. When filtration cells (podocytes) in the kidney’s glomeruli become damaged due to either immune complexes in the blood (called glomerulonephritis), or due to dense deposits of hard protein (amyloid), abnormal accumulation of which is called amyloidosis, degeneration of the kidney’s tubular system occurs. This is medically referred to as nephrotic syndrome. Patients with nephrotic syndrome lose too many necessary proteins into the urine (proteinuria). Two of these proteins are albumin, which helps to maintain blood pressure and keep blood in the vessels, and antithrombin III, which prevents blood clots from forming.
"
"When greater than 3.5g of proteins are lost each day, blood pressure falls, less blood stays in the blood vessels, and consequently, the kidneys act to conserve sodium in the body.  This causes swelling of the limbs, hypertension and fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity.
"
"Since crucial thyroid proteins, which control the body’s metabolic rate, are also lost into the urine, signs of hypothyroidism can also be seen; there is a decreased break-down of cholesterol, and the affected dog often will show signs of muscle wasting. In addition, the liver also increases its production of proteins and lipids, further raising the levels of cholesterol-rich lipids circulating in the blood.  This can lead to arteriosclerosis, diminished blood circulation due to thickening, and hardening of the arterial walls. Also, since proteins essential for breaking down blood clots are lost into the urine, the blood coagulates much more easily and blood clots can become lodged in blood vessels, causing paralysis or strokes.
"
"Progressive glomerular disease can lead to urea nitrogen and creatinine (a metabolic waste product) accumulation in the bloodstream, and eventually, long-term kidney failure. Glomerular disease is relatively common in dogs.
"
"Long-term Inflammatory conditions predispose animals to developing glomerulonephritis or amyloidosis:
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, along with a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count (CBC), an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected secondarily.
"
"Protein electrophoresis may help to identify which proteins are being lost into the urine through the kidneys so that a prognosis can be established. X-ray and ultrasound imaging will show if there has been a loss of detail in the abdominal cavity due to fluid seeping into the abdominal cavity (effusion). If glomerular disease is the cause of the nephrotic syndrome, mild enlargement of the kidneys may also be observed.
"
"
"
"The majority of patients can be treated on an outpatient basis, but if your dog is showing signs of severe nitrogenous waste in the bloodstream (azotemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), or blocked vessels due to clotting (thromboembolic disease), it should be hospitalized. Your veterinarian may prescribe medication to stop the loss of protein into your dog's urine and to increase its blood pressure.
"
"You will need to limit your dog's activity in order to prevent thromboembolic disease.  A low-protein, low-sodium diet, such as a commercial kidney diet, should be fed to your dog. Your veterinarian will assist you in creating the best diet plan.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your dog starting at one month after the initial treatment, and then again at three month intervals for the year following. At each visit, a chemical blood profile, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel will be performed. The chemical blood profile is useful for monitoring kidney function, and the urinalysis will indicate the amount of protein being lost into the urine. Your doctor will also take your dog's blood pressure and monitor its weight at each visit.
"
"Glomerulonephritis and amyloidosis are progressive. If the underlying cause cannot be resolved, your dog will eventually lose all kidney function. The prognosis for end-stage kidney disease is poor.

"Kidney infections are just what they sound like—infections, almost always caused by bacteria, that primarily affect the kidneys. Kidney infections are not all that common, but any dog that has a history of bladder infections is at increased risk. The infections can affect dogs of all ages but are diagnosed more often in females that are middle-aged or older.
"
"Kidney infections are very serious. Severe infections or even milder, chronic infections can seriously damage the kidneys and eventually lead to kidney failure. If you think your dog might have a kidney infection, make an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Initially, dogs with kidney infections may not have many symptoms. They may seem just a bit “off.” As time goes on, however, more signs typically develop, including:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Poor appetite
"
"Fever
"
"Abdominal pain
"
"Increased thirst and urination
"
"Blood in the urine
"
"Straining to urinate
"
"Urinating inside the house
"
"Urinating frequent small amounts
"
"Vomiting
"
"Weight loss
"
"Most kidney infections start in the bladder and are caused by bacteria that have traveled up a  dog’s urethra (the tube connecting the bladder to the outside world). Bacteria that are found in feces are most often to blame for bladder and kidney infections.
"
"The urinary tract has many natural defenses against infection, but health problems can break down those defenses.
"
"Chronic kidney disease—The inflammation and dilute (watery) urine associated with chronic kidney disease make urinary tract infections more likely.
"
"Anatomic abnormalities—Some dogs are born with anatomic abnormalities that predispose them to urinary tract infections. For example, when a ureter (the tube that normally connects a kidney to the bladder) drains into the urethra, bacteria can more easily travel up to the kidney.
"
"Urinary stones—Stones damage the inner surface of the urinary tract and make it more susceptible to infection.
"
"Diabetes—Dogs with diabetes have dilute urine that contains sugar, which is an ideal breeding ground for bacteria.
"
"Cushing’s disease—The high cortisol levels associated with Cushing’s disease suppress the immune system and create dilute urine, which increases the chances of infection.
"
"Urinary tract cancer—Tumors within the urinary tract can lead to bleeding, inflammation, and anatomic abnormalities that all make infection more likely.
"
"Immunosuppressive medications—Dogs who are on medications that suppress the immune system are at increased risk of infection.
"
"These types of underlying health problems make kidney infections more likely, but sometimes kidney infections seem to appear out of nowhere.
"
"Any dog that might have a kidney infection should be checked by a veterinarian. The doctor will start by asking questions about your dog’s overall health and the symptoms you have been seeing at home. They will then perform a physical exam and probably recommend some basic lab work including a complete blood cell count (CBC), a blood chemistry panel, and a urinalysis to look for signs of infection and check your dog’s kidney function.
"
"When a dog has a urinary tract infection, it can be difficult to figure out if it involves only the bladder (most common) or if the kidneys are involved as well, a rare but more serious condition. Abdominal X-rays may show kidney enlargement or other problems, but an ultrasound is the best way to look for evidence of infection in the kidneys.
"
"Veterinarians will often collect urine with a sterile needle and syringe directly from a dog’s bladder or even from their kidneys, using ultrasound as guidance. The sample can be sent to the lab for culture and sensitivity tests—growing any bacteria that are present and then testing various antibiotics against them to see which will work best to treat the infection.
"
"There are no home remedies for kidney infections in dogs. Prescription antibiotics are an essential part of treatment. Veterinarians will first pick an antibiotic that is likely to work well but may make a change based on the results of the dog’s urine culture and sensitivity test.
"
"Commonly prescribed antibiotics include:
"
"Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
"
"Cefpodoxime
"
"Marbofloxacin
"
"Enrofloxacin
"
"Dogs that aren’t feeling too bad may simply be sent home to take oral antibiotics. More severely affected dogs may need to be hospitalized so they can get antibiotics by injection, fluid therapy, and any other needed treatments.
"
"Most dogs with kidney infections require 10–14 days of antibiotic therapy. As long as your dog seems back to normal, your veterinarian may wait one to two weeks after treatment has stopped to perform a recheck to ensure all signs of the kidney infection are gone.
"
"Most kidney infections start out as bladder infections, so the best way to prevent kidney infections is to treat bladder infections quickly and completely. Have your dog seen by a veterinarian if you notice any of these signs of a bladder infection:
"
"Discomfort when urinating
"
"Urinating frequent small amounts
"
"Having accidents
"
"Discolored urine
"
"Licking more often at the urinary opening
"
"Your veterinarian can also recommend a monitoring plan if your dog has an underlying health problem that makes bladder or kidney infections more likely.

"Renomegaly is a condition in which one or both kidneys are abnormally large, confirmed by abdominal palpation, ultrasounds, or X-rays. All of the body's systems are affected by renomegaly: the respiratory, nervous, hormonal, urinary, and digestive systems.
"
"In addition, renomegaly is not exclusive to dogs; cats can suffer from it, too. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"There are occasions when the dog is asymptomatic, or does not display any signs whatsoever. However, some of the more common symptoms seen in dogs with renomegaly include:
"
"The kidneys may become abnormally large as a result of inflammation, infection, or cancer. Renomegaly can also occur due to urinary tract obstruction, degeneration of the urinary tubes (ureters), formation of cysts in the urinary tract, various infections, abscesses, inflammatory conditions, genetically transmitted diseases, clots in the kidneys, and toxins in the system.
"
"Exposure to infections such as leptospirosis may also lead to renomegaly.
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. A palpation exam and X-rays will also be performed to assist your veterinarian in visualizing the abnormality in the kidney size, and thus diagnose your dog's condition.
"
"For dogs with cancer, thoracic X-rays will help your doctor to determine if the cancer has spread. Ultrasonography, which uses sound waves, will also help distinguish the structural details of internal organs so that your doctor can determine the amount of renal swelling, or detect irregularities in other organs.
"
"Aspiration of renal fluid and a biopsy is another procedure which may be performed on your dog.
"
"
"
"Your dog will be treated on an outpatient basis unless it is suffering from dehydration or renal failure. Treatment will begin with diagnosing and treating the underlying cause, maintaining fluid balance with intravenous fluids if necessary, and replenishing minerals and electrolytes. If your dog is otherwise healthy, a normal diet and normal exercise will be advised.
"
"Drugs prescribed by your veterinarian will vary according to the underlying cause of renomegaly. However, drugs that may have a toxic effect on the kidneys should be avoided.
"
"You veterinarian will want to see your dog during regular follow-up examinations, where he or she will assess the dog's physical recovery and hydration status.
"
"If your dog's symptoms return, you will need to contact the veterinarian immediately. Possible complications of renomegaly include kidney failure and hormone imbalances that mimic hormone-producing cancers.

"The primary job of the kidneys is to filter the blood by removing waste products and controlling the amount of fluid and nutrients kept in the body and how much is passed in urine.
"
"With any type of kidney failure, this filtering isn’t working well, so waste products are not properly removed from the bloodstream and too much fluid is passed in urine along with proteins and electrolytes. As waste products build up in the blood and tissues, dogs can get ulcerations (tears) in the lining of their digestive tract as well.
"
"Kidney failure may also be referred to by terms listed below. The word renal refers to all things related to kidneys, and is often used interchangeably. Failure, insufficiency, and disease are commonly used to describe similar issues with the kidneys.
"
"Renal failure
"
"Renal insufficiency
"
"Kidney disease
"
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
"
"Kidney disease is often divided into categories based on how long it has been affecting the dog. Acute renal failure occurs in a very short time frame, and is often caused by eating or drinking a toxin or getting a severe infection that harms the kidneys. Chronic kidney disease refers to a process with a more gradual onset or one that has been happening for a longer period of time.
"
"Changes that can occur with an aging pet are often caused by chronic kidney disease, but if a dog’s kidneys were damaged by eating a toxic item several months ago and he now has renal failure because of this, it is also known as chronic kidney disease.
"
"Health Tools
"
"Acute uremia is a sudden-onset condition that is characterized by high levels of urea, protein products, and amino acids in the blood. This condition usually follows sudden kidney injuries, or occurs when the urinary tubes that connect the kidney to the bladder (ureters) are obstructed. As a result, the outflow of urine is obstructed, creating an imbalance in fluid regulation and leading to a buildup of potential toxins in the body. Fortunately, acute uremia can be successfully treated and cured if it is identified on time and treated promptly.
"
"Most dog breeds, whether male or female, are affected by acute uremia; however, exposure to chemicals such as antifreeze increases the risk of uremia. Therefore, the incidence of acute uremia is higher in the winter and fall than in other seasons. In addition, dogs are most susceptible to acute uremia between the ages of six and eight.
"
"The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how acute uremia affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"As this potentially toxic blood flows through the dog's body, most systems are affected, including the urinary, digestive, nervous, respiratory, musculoskeletal, lymphatic, and immune systems.
"
"Upon examination, dogs will appear to be in normal physical condition, with a normal hair coat, but may appear to be in a depressed state. When symptoms are apparent, signs can include loss of appetite, listlessness, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be tinted with blood. Other symptoms may include inflammation of the tongue,ammonia-smelling breathe (due to urea), ulcers in the mouth, fever, abnormally fast or slow pulse, decreased or increased urine output, and even seizures. The kidneys may feel enlarged, tender, and firm on palpation.
"
"Kidney failure or obstruction to urine output may be due to any of the following:
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted by your veterinarian, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Dogs with acute uremia may have high packed cell volume and an increased white blood cell count. The levels of certain protein enzymes and chemicals such as creatinine, phosphate, glucose, glucose, and potassium will also be high.
"
"Urine may be collected by inserting a catheter or by fine needle aspiration into the dog; the results of which may show high levels of protein, glucose, and the presence of blood cells. In order to view and examine the urinary system clearly, contrast dyes may be injected into the bladder so that the interior of the bladder, the ureters, and the kidney are illuminated on X-ray and ultrasonography imaging.
"
"
"
"If the uremia is due to toxic poisoning, the first step will be to eliminate the toxins from the body. This may be done through gastric lavage, where the stomach is cleansed, or by administering activated charcoal to neutralize the toxin. Specific antidotes may also be administered if the toxic agent can be identified.
"
"Care is also aimed at re-establishing fluid balance, blood circulation, and in establishing the balance of chemicals in the blood. Strictly monitoring fluid intake, food consumption, and nutrition is very important while treatment is underway.
"
"Some medications that may be prescribed are:
"
"Generally, this condition has a poor prognosis for recovery. Some possible complications include seizures, coma, high blood pressure, pneumonia, bleeding in the digestive tract, cardiac arrest, fluid overload, widespread infection in the blood, and multiple organ failure.
"
"The cost involved with the whole procedure of treatment is also very high. Sometimes, dialysis can be used until the dog is stable enough to tolerate surgery.

"Kidney failure can occur because of an acute event, such as a toxin ingestion or infection that harms the kidneys; degenerative (worsening) changes over time; or an underlying medical condition that damages renal tissues, which can occur due to genetic predispositions in some dog breeds.
"
"Specific causes include:
"
"Ingested toxins
"
"Ethylene glycol (antifreeze)
"
"Grapes or raisins
"
"Human medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen
"
"An overdose of canine medications such as carprofen or meloxicam
"
"Metabolic diseases
"
"Fanconi syndrome
"
"Diabetes mellitus
"
"Diabetes insipidus
"
"Hypertension
"
"Kidney infections
"
"Lyme disease
"
"Leptospirosis
"
"After the procedures are complete, it is important to monitor daily fluid levels, mineral levels, body weight, urine output, and general physical status. The entire process of recovery depends on various factors, such as the extent of organ or system damage, the origin of the disease, and the existence of other pathological conditions or diseased organs.

"Your veterinarian will want to run several tests, in addition to a physical exam, to diagnose kidney failure, such as:
"
"Complete blood count
"
"Chemistry panel
"
"Urinalysis with culture
"
"Abdominal ultrasound
"
"Treatment of kidney failure is based on the severity of the disease and whether it is acute or chronic.
"
"Acute kidney disease is treated with hospitalization and IV fluid therapy to support the kidneys and help them remove wastes. Depending on the cause of the disease, decontamination medications, toxin-binding medications, antibiotics, or medications to support the gastrointestinal tract may be given. In extreme cases, renal dialysis can help the kidneys. This last procedure is rare, only available at some university or veterinary specialty hospitals.
"
"Chronic kidney disease requires careful management of dogs at home. They need to have access to water at all times and be encouraged to drink water. Many dogs have improvements with a prescription kidney diet. Some dogs need to be on medications to control high blood pressure or to protect their stomach. Pets with chronic kidney disease need to see their veterinarian often so that their renal values can be checked. Some dogs with kidney disease need to receive injectable fluids at home or may even need to be hospitalized at times to help their fluid needs.
"
"With acute kidney failure, prognosis is variable depending upon the cause of the disease, how severe the disease is, how damaged the kidneys are, the speed and aggressiveness of treatment, and the dog’s response.
"
"For chronic renal failure, long-term prognosis is not good. Most dogs die or are euthanized within a year because of poor quality of life.
"
"The families of dogs with kidney disease should expect to watch them closely and will need to see their veterinarian often, especially as their pet’s kidney function gets worse. These dogs will be easily dehydrated, as their kidneys are not able to keep water in their bodies. Any infection, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in appetite or activity could severely dehydrate the pet and worsen the disease.
"
"Kidney disease is a broader term that includes any problem with the kidneys. Kidney failure is a specific term that means the kidneys can’t keep up with filtering waste products and managing fluid levels.
"
"Depending on the severity and progression of the disease, kidney failure can be fatal.

"Dogs have two kidneys located just above the bladder, near the spine and midway down the back. Similar to humans, dogs rely on these bean-shaped organs to help control blood pressure, filter waste from the blood, maintain the balance of nutrients in the blood, and increase production of red blood cells.  
"
"The kidneys and their surrounding tissues can develop cancers, including cancers that develop in the kidney (primary) or cancers that travel from other sites and develop in the kidney (metastatic). Primary tumors are rare, accounting for less than 2% of all dogs and usually limited to one kidney.  
"
"There are many types of benign (non-cancerous) tumors that can occur in the kidneys of dogs, including papillomas and fibromas. These are relatively rare. 
"
"The type of tumor depends on where it started in the body. Types of kidney tumors in dogs include: 
"
"Carcinomas—The most common type of primary kidney tumor. Carcinomas usually start in the epithelial tissue and skin. 
"
"Adenocarcinomas—A type of malignant cancer that starts in the glands. 
"
"Sarcomas—A type of cancer that starts in the bones or muscles. 
"
"Metastatic tumors can include: 
"
"Renal carcinoma: This is the most common type of cancerous kidney tumor, and typically only develop in one kidney. Renal carcinomas commonly spread to the lungs, abdominal organs, or local lymph nodes, but can also be seen in the skin, heart, brain, and skeleton.  
"
"Due to the proximity of the kidneys to the caudal vena cava (the major vein that transports blood from the lower body and abdominal organs back to the right side of the heart), renal carcinoma can invade the vessel and other nearby veins, causing potentially dangerous blood clots to form. Older, large to medium breed male dogs are most likely to be affected. 
"
"Other primary tumors found in the kidney: These tumors include transitional cell carcinoma, hemangiosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, anaplastic sarcoma, lymphoma (very rare), and nephroblastoma. Nephroblastoma is an aggressive congenital tumor that is usually diagnosed in dogs less than 12 months of age. It destroys the functional structures of the kidney and has a 65% rate of metastasizing to other sites, with the liver and lungs as the most common site of spread. 
"
"Renal cystadenocarcinoma: This is an inherited condition seen in the German Shepherd breed that represents 6% of all kidney tumors seen in the breed. Renal cystadenocarcinoma affects both kidneys and slowly deteriorates the kidney’s ability to function normally.  
"
"Often called renal cystadenocarcinoma and nodular dermatofibrosis due to the prevalence of dogs also affected by skin and uterine masses (growths), most dogs affected by this disease begin showing symptoms, consisting of small firm bumps beneath the skin on the dog’s legs and head, at around 6 years of age. 
"
"Tumors of the kidney can cause general symptoms such as: 
"
"Abdominal pain 
"
"Abdominal distension (swollen belly) 
"
"Loss of appetite 
"
"Weight loss 
"
"Nausea 
"
"Vomiting 
"
"Lethargy 
"
"Depression 
"
"Blood in urine (rare) 
"
"Most veterinarians discover kidney tumors by physically feeling an enlarged or excessively firm kidney during a routine annual exam. 
"
"The cause of cancers of the kidney, or any cancer, is typically unknown. Most cancers seem to be caused by environmental or genetic factors, but there are no known environmental causes of cancers of the kidney in dogs at this time. 
"
"The blood work (including blood chemistry and complete blood count) of a dog with cancer of the kidney may reveal no abnormalities but should always be performed to provide information about the overall health of the dog.  
"
"A urinalysis (testing of the urine) may reveal high protein levels or the presence of red blood cells, which can help lead to a diagnosis. X-rays of the abdomen can also be an excellent screening test since they will often show an enlarged affected kidney. Radiographs of the thorax (chest), spine, and legs may be recommended to screen for metastatic disease, which can influence decisions about whether to pursue surgery as treatment.  
"
"A CT or MRI may be recommended to better identify any tumor invasion into surrounding tissues, outside of the kidney, for surgical planning. An ultrasound of the abdomen can be used to confirm kidney involvement and structural changes along with identifying potential metastasis (cancer spread) to other organs or lymph nodes.  
"
"A vet may also recommend a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. During this test, a thin needle is inserted into an organ to collect a sample of material for further diagnosis. An ultrasound can also be used to guide an FNA biopsy. 
"
"The most common treatment for cancer of the kidney in dogs is surgery to remove the affected kidney and the associated ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder). Surgical planning is based on the type of tumor, the presence or absence of metastasis, and whether the tumor has invaded nearby structures, such as the caudal vena cava.  
"
"Specifically, renal carcinoma has proven to be highly resistant to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy. Results have been disappointing, with less than 10% of renal carcinoma patients showing any response to chemotherapy. Your vet will be able to determine a treatment plan that works best for your dog.  
"
"Recovery from surgery will consist of rest, medications (e.g., anti-inflammatories, pain medications, antibiotics), and follow-up visits to your vet’s office to monitor for recurrence of the disease in areas where metastasis might have spread.  
"
"Dogs with no evidence of metastasis (spreading of cancer) and successful removal of the affected kidney can survive for up to 4 years. However, the average survival time for dogs diagnosed with renal carcinoma is 8 to 16 months after diagnosis. This short average survival time is due to difficulties in removing the tumor, a high metastatic rate, and the advanced stage of the disease at the time of initial diagnosis. 
"
"Renal carcinoma is typically the most aggressive type of kidney cancer for dogs, because the area it grows within the kidney has a high metastatic rate. Metastatic disease is common, with 54% of dogs diagnosed with metastatic disease in their lungs or abdominal organs and 27% metastasized to lymph nodes. Other sites often affected by metastasis include the heart, brain, and bones. 
"
"Dogs with no evidence of metastasis and successful removal of the affected kidney typically have a good prognosis, however there is no known definitive cure for cancers of the kidney in dogs.

"Polycystic kidney disease is a disorder in which large portions of renal parenchyma, the functional tissue of the kidneys which are normally differentiated, are displaced by multiple cysts.
"
"A cyst is a closed sac that may be filled with air, fluid, or semi-solid material. Renal cysts develop in pre-existing nephrons -- the functional filtering cells of the kidney tissue -- and in the collecting ducts. Invariably, the disease both of the dog's kidneys.
"
"Although polycystic kidney disease is usually not immediately life-threatening, it should be treated as early as possible to prevent cyst progression and development of secondary bacterial infection, either of which may lead to sepsis, the presence of pus-forming toxic organisms in the blood.
"
"Both dogs and cats may develop polycystic kidney disease, with some breeds more susceptible than others. For instance, the Cairn Terrier and Beagle are most frequently affected by this kidney disease than other breeds.
"
"If you would like to learn how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Polycystic kidney disease may be difficult to detect in the initial stages. The cysts often remain undetected until they become large and numerous enough to contribute to kidney failure or an enlarged abdomen. Most patients do not exhibit any symptoms during initial stages of cyst formation and growth.
"
"Once the disease has progressed, bosselated (lumpy) kidneys may be detected. This is discovered during an abdominal palpatation, in which the abdominal muscles twitch uncontrollably.
"
"Most renal cysts are not painful, so the dog may not exhibit any discomfort, but secondary infection associated with the cysts may result in later discomfort.
"
"The exact stimuli for renal cysts is not precisely known. Genetic, environmental, and endogenous factors appear to influence the development of this disease.
"
"Endogenous compounds that are believed to contribute to cyst development include the parathyroid hormone (a hormone secreted by the parathyroid hormones of the endocrine system) and vasopressin (a peptide hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus area of the brain).
"
"One diagnostic procedure that may be used if polycystic kidney disease is suspected is an evaluation of the fluids through fine needle aspirates of the kidney (in which fluid is removed via needle), which may help to pinpoint the origination of the cysts.
"
"Additional diagnostic procedures that may be required include abdominal ultrasounds, which may reveal the presence of cysts in some organs, a urine analysis, and an examination of cystic fluid. A bacterial culture of cyst fluids can be done to determine if secondary infection has developed and needs to be treated. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, may also be present.
"
"If polycystic kidney disease is not the cause of the dog's symptoms, alternate diagnoses may include an unnatural cell growth, such as tumor in the kidney, kidney failure, and a variety of other cystic diseases of the kidneys.
"
"Key-Gaskell syndrome, also known as canine dysautonomia, is a neurological disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system in dogs. The autonomic nervous system controls many of your dog’s bodily functions, such as:
"
"Dysautonomia causes dysfunction within the nerves of the autonomic system. It can affect a dog’s eyes, digestive system, or urinary tract. While this condition is typically fatal, it is relatively rare in dogs.
"
"Symptoms may come on quickly, within a few hours, or over several weeks. Signs of dysautonomia can vary but often include:
"
"Symptoms such as difficulty urinating and having trouble breathing warrant an immediate trip to the veterinarian.
"
"The exact cause of dysautonomia in dogs is not fully understood. Key-Gaskell syndrome may be triggered by exposure to certain environmental factors. The intake of plants, toxins, or contaminated food or water may contribute to the development of the condition. However, specific agents have not yet been determined.
"
"Diagnosing Key-Gaskell syndrome typically involves your vet performing a physical exam on your dog, identifying their symptoms, and taking diagnostic tests.
"
"
"
"Elimination of renal cysts is not possible at this time, thus treatment is often limited to minimizing the consequences of cyst formation, such as infection in the kidneys. Periodic removal of fluid from large renal cysts with a needle (a process known as aspiration) can be used to minimize pain and reduce cyst volume, and a number of medications may be prescribed to deal with symptoms and secondary complications, such as bacterial infection.
"
"Dogs with polycystic kidney disease should be monitored every two to six months for associated diseases, such as kidney infection, kidney failure, and increased pain. If bacterial infection and associated sepsis (the presence of pus-forming and toxic organisms in the blood) does not occur, the short-term prognosis is favorable -- even without treatment.
"
"The long-term prognosis for dogs with polycystic kidney diseases usually depends on the severity of the condition, and any subsequent progression to kidney failure.
"
"Because the exact cause of polycystic kidney disease is unknown, there is no specific preventative measure that can be taken. Selective breeding, however, may reduce genetic diversity, thereby increasing the frequency of other unwanted inherited traits in affected breeds.

"
"Your vet will ask you several questions to get a thorough history of your dog's health, a timeline of their symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to dysautonomia. This history may provide clues as to which organs are being affected. While there is no specific test for dysautonomia, the following procedures may be used:
"
"Eye Exam Findings
"
"Your vet will perform a Schirmer tear test on your dog. This painless test is used to see if your dog is producing enough tears. Your vet will place a strip of special paper in your dog’s lower eyelid. Moisture and tears from your dog’s eye will drip onto the paper for 60 seconds, and your vet will analyze the results.
"
"Imaging
"
"X-rays can show evidence of aspiration pneumonia (food or liquid in the lungs), a dilated (enlarged) esophagus, enlarged intestines, and a swollen bladder. Esophageal dysfunction can be confirmed with fluoroscopy (an imaging procedure that shows real-time moving images of your dog’s esophagus).
"
"An abdominal ultrasound allows your vet to see your dog’s organs. If the symptom is present, this test can confirm the slow movement of your dog’s intestines.
"
"An echocardiogram, or an ultrasound of the heart, can reveal enlargement of the left atrium (upper cavity) and ventricle (main chamber). Enlargement can lead to decreased functions of the heart. This may cause weakness, inability to exercise, a heart murmur (a swishing or whooshing sound found in the heartbeat), or an abnormal heart rhythm. Most dogs only experience some of the symptoms.
"
"Pharmacologic tests
"
"Key-Gaskell syndrome may cause loss of control of the eye’s iris. This can make your dog sensitive to certain medications.
"
"Pilocarpine is a medication used in pets with eye disease. When it’s applied to the eye of a dog with dysautonomia, it will cause the pupil to become narrow within 45 to 60 minutes. In a healthy dog, there won’t be a change in pupil size.
"
"Your vet may also perform an Atropine challenge test, which will check your dog’s heart health. If you give atropine to a healthy dog, their heart rate will rise. However, when a dog has Key-Gaskell syndrome, their rate will stay the same.
"
"Biopsy/Necropsy/Histopathology
"
"To diagnose this condition, veterinary pathologists can examine tissue samples from the intestines and assess the condition of the mesenteric plexus, a complex network of nerves found in the gut. In some cases, Key-Gaskell syndrome can only be confirmed after death by analyzing the nerve cells of the spinal cord and the base of the brain. In acute cases, there is notable degeneration of nerve cells, while in chronic cases, there is both loss of nerve cells and an increase in a specific type of supporting cells.
"
"Unfortunately, there’s no cure for dysautonomia. Your vet will focus on supportive care, symptom management, and keeping your dog comfortable. This may include:
"
"These treatments aim to ease your dog’s symptoms and improve your dog’s quality of life. Some dogs may be able to live with the condition, while others may not. Dogs with symptoms like KCS (dry eye) and constipation tend to live longer with this disease because they are easier to manage with medications like eye drops and stool softeners. Dogs that develop aspiration pneumonia or suffer heart abnormalities have a shorter survival time.
"
"The following are the most common therapies offered to dogs with Key-Gaskell syndrome:
"
"Fluid therapy—Dysautonomia can cause dehydration due to decreased creation of saliva and tears. Intravenous (in the vein) or subcutaneous (under the skin) fluid therapy may be recommended to keep your dog hydrated.
"
"Nutritional support—Some dogs may have a hard time eating, which might require a feeding tube. Your vet may also recommend food that is easily digestible such as Hill’s® Science Diet a/d. These treatments may be used until your dog is no longer gagging and their weight loss has stopped.
"
"Gastrointestinal support—Your vet may prescribe medication to ease vomiting, nausea, and other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Medication that helps with your dog’s GI movement can help lessen any issues. Stool softeners can also be given to stop constipation.
"
"Eye and nose support—Eye drops such as Optimmune® can help treat dry eyes. Humidifying the air and using artificial tears and lubricants can also keep your dog’s eyes and nose moist. Products include Optixcare® Eye Lube, Bag Balm, or Dermoscent® BioBalm.
"
"Urinary support—Your vet may also suggest medication or placing a urinary catheter in your dog’s bladder at the start of treatment.
"
"Treatment for infection—Antibiotics may be given to treat or prevent secondary bacterial infections in your dog.
"
"The course of dysautonomia can vary and the condition cannot be cured, only managed. If a dog is provided treatment for their symptoms, improvement may be seen as early as 24 hours or as late as three to four weeks. The severity of symptoms, disease progression, and response to treatment all play a role in determining your dog’s quality of life.
"
"Dogs managing Key-Gaskell syndrome should be watched closely. Your vet will regularly monitor their vital signs (temperature, breathing, and heart rate), water intake, urination, body weight, and bowel movements.

"Kennel cough is a common cause of coughing in dogs—especially in those that have been to the groomer, a boarding facility, or dog parks.  Kennel cough, also known as canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) or infectious tracheobronchitis, is a highly contagious respiratory disease in dogs. Dogs can develop kennel cough approximately two to 14 days after exposure.
"
"Kennel cough in dogs presents as a dry, hacking cough. It may sound like your pup has something stuck in their throat. Some pet parents will describe the cough like a honk, while others say it’s more of a sharp, puffing cough that won’t stop.
"
"Kennel cough can cause mild symptoms in some dogs, but it can progress to life-threatening pneumonia in others. Because of this, it’s important to recognize the symptoms of kennel cough.
"
"While many cases of kennel cough can resolve on their own with supportive care at home. Many dogs affected by kennel cough will act completely normal besides the cough itself.
"
"However, some pups may require emergency veterinary care if they’re showing signs of pneumonia. This includes lethargy, loss of appetite, fever, and a greenish-yellow discharge from their nose.
"
"If your dog is experiencing these symptoms, take them to a vet immediately.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Symptoms of kennel cough in dogs include:
"
"A persistent dry, hacking cough
"
"Coughing during the night that keeps you and your dog awake.
"
"Retching with the production of white foam
"
"Clear eye drainage
"
"Runny nose and sneezing
"
"Tracheal sensitivity (your dog coughs when you apply gentle pressure to their trachea)
"
"Though kennel cough in dogs may resolve without treatment, it can progress to more severe symptoms, especially in puppies and senior dogs. It’s important to understand that kennel cough isn’t caused by a single bug, but rather a combination of several different viruses and bacteria.
"
"Some combinations are more serious than others and can make your dog feel extremely ill. These dogs have more severe symptoms of kennel cough and need to be seen by their vet.
"
"Severe symptoms of kennel cough include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Loss of appetite
"
"Fever
"
"Labored breathing
"
"Dogs with these severe symptoms need to see their veterinarian immediately for diagnosis and treatment. If your dog develops labored breathing or is declining, take them to an emergency veterinarian immediately.
"
"
"
"
"
"Kennel cough in dogs can be caused by multiple bacteria and viruses, including:
"
"Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria
"
"Canine adenovirus
"
"Parainfluenza virus
"
"Mycoplasma
"
"Canine influenza virus
"
"Canine distemper virus
"
"Canine respiratory corona virus
"
"Canine reovirus
"
"Kennel cough in dogs is typically spread when a healthy pup is exposed to the respiratory secretions of an infected dog. This can be through coughing or sneezing. Dogs can also contract kennel cough from infected objects (such as shared toys, food bowls, or water bowls).
"
"Dogs are typically exposed to kennel cough when they are in crowded areas, such as:
"
"Animal shelters
"
"Boarding kennels
"
"Dog daycare facilities
"
"Grooming facilities
"
"Dog parks
"
"A diagnosis for kennel cough in dogs can be made based on the dog’s symptoms, history, and response to therapy. Identifying the underlying bacteria or virus is typically not needed. However, diagnostic testing is recommended for:
"
"Dogs where pneumonia is suspected
"
"Dogs that do not respond to supportive care
"
"Dogs with signs of systemic disease
"
"If an outbreak is occurring in multiple dogs
"
"These diagnostic tests may include:
"
"Blood work
"
"Chest X-rays
"
"PCR testing (looking for the genetic material of a virus or bacteria to diagnose an infection)   
"
"The treatment for kennel cough will depend on your dog and the severity of the condition.
"
"For mild cases of kennel cough, treatment may only include supportive care, which focuses on rest, nutrition, and hydration.
"
"Your dog’s airways can dry out from all the coughing. Keeping them in the bathroom while you shower is a good way to help them keep their airways moist. Adding a humidifier to the room they sleep in may also be beneficial.
"
"A cough suppressant may be prescribed by your dog’s veterinarian to help reduce the frequency of the cough.
"
"It should take about one to two weeks for a dog to recover from a mild case of kennel cough. Some dogs can completely recover on their own with no treatment required.
"
"Complicated cases of kennel cough can cause your dog to become extremely sick. A dog with severe kennel cough will most likely be coughing, acting lethargic, and not wanting to eat or drink.
"
"If a dog has developed pneumonia, then treatment can involve:
"
"Hospitalization
"
"Intravenous fluids
"
"Antibiotics
"
"Possibly oxygen therapy
"
"While your dog is home recovering from kennel cough, make sure to avoid irritants such as household cleaners, cigarette smoke, and dust. These things can cause more irritation and prolong your dog’s recovery.
"
"Do not use a collar and leash if your dog has kennel cough or is recovering. Change to using harnesses during walks, as collars with leashes place extra pressure on the trachea, which induces coughing.
"
"To help minimize the risk of your pet getting kennel cough, vaccination against one of the common causes (Bordetella bronchiseptica) is generally recommended. 
"
"When looking for grooming facilities, daycare facilities, or general doggy play date partners, ask about their vaccine requirements to ensure the dogs your pup will be in contact with are also vaccinated. While fully vaccinated dogs can still get kennel cough, this preventative measure may help keep your pet protected. 
"
"There is also a kennel cough vaccination that your vet may recommend.
"
"Because kennel cough is often the result of a combination of respiratory viruses and/or bacteria, the vaccine is not 100% effective at preventing the disease. However, dogs that are vaccinated are much more likely to only get mild symptoms of kennel cough instead of severe symptoms. It’s also helpful to reduce their chances of contracting this common illness.
"
"Dogs that have a brachycephalic face with a smushed-looking nose (like English Bulldogs, Pugs, Pekingese, and French Bulldogs) are strongly encouraged to get the vaccine.
"
"These breeds are more likely to struggle with recovering from respiratory diseases with their compromised airways and can benefit from a stronger immune response that the vaccine provides.
"
"Some pet parents may elect to skip vaccinating for kennel cough because their pet never has exposure to other dogs. Fortunately, this vaccine comes in many forms with an oral liquid being one of the most popular.
"
"It’s very safe with little side effects and no injection with a needle required.
"
"Kennel cough is not contagious to humans, only dogs.
"
"Dogs that are still coughing are contagious. Ideally wait at least two weeks after their last cough before exposing them to other dogs.
"
"While most cases of kennel cough are mild, kennel cough can become deadly if a dog develops pneumonia.

"Undesirable behavior exhibited by dogs between puppyhood and adolescence, such as destructive chewing, jumping on people, and play biting, is medically referred to as pediatric behavior problems. Though these behaviors may be perceived as a “normal” trait of a puppy, it is often not acceptable behavior for a pet. It is important to address this as early as possible with behavioral modification therapies while the puppy is still impressionable.
"
"Genetics do play an important role and behavior of young pups is likely to be similar to those of their parents. Certain breeds inherit certain problems like unruly, activity problems in working breeds of dog. However, such behavioral problems have been found to be more common in urban areas where opportunities for exercise and play are limited.
"
"Destructive Chewing
"
"Initially, the pup may chew and damage furniture and/or other household items in the presence of family member, but after being caught and punished, he may continue be destructive when no family member is around.
"
"Playbiting
"
"Play fighting may be started by a family member initially, but can further escalate or become spontaneous afterward. This is a problem because the deciduous teeth of puppies are still sharp and can cause injury if it bites the hands, legs, and/or clothing of family members. Growling and barking may also develop, but usually differ from the acts associated with fear or justified aggression.
"
"Jumping on People
"
"Jumping on people and placing paws on visitors and/or family members typically occurs during greetings and when she is excited, but may occur when the pup wants attention or something in the person's hand.
"
"Getting on Counters/Furniture
"
"The pup may get on the counters or furniture to grab an object to chew or eat. He or she may also jump on furniture during play, to get attention, or to rest.
"
"While many behavior problems in puppies are species-typical, there are some causes that can worsen behavioral issues -- many of which are related to inadequate supervision, control, training, exercise, and/or the pup’s general environment. Specific factors that may lead to the categories listed above include:
"
"Destructive chewing
"
"Play biting
"
"Getting on Counters/Furniture
"
"You will need to give the veterinarian a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The questions will particularly focus on the pup's environment, new additions to the family (including other animals), and other related topics. Laboratory tests, meanwhile, are often not conducted unless a concurrent disease or condition is present.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will discuss the various behavior modifications techniques like rewards and punishment. It is, however, never advisable to strike the pet, shake it by the scruff, thump its nose, role it on its back or squeeze its lips against its teeth to stop mouthing or biting. Such approaches are detrimental to existing behavioral problems and may aggravate the condition due to fear and aggression.

"Vigorous exercise can also be extremely helpful for pups with these types of behavioral problems. Involving these puppies in healthy games like fetch/drop, for example, lets the pup know that the human is in control. Certain medications may also be used especially in cases not responding well to behavioral therapy. Other tips your veterinarian may recommend include:
"
"To Discourage Destructive Chewing
"
"Playbiting
"
"Jumping on People
"
"Getting on Counters/Furniture
"
"It is important you follow-up with your veterinarian to ascertain the effectiveness of the behavioral therapy program. Prognosis in most cases is good; in addition, the frequency and intensity of such behaviors typically decrease with age. 
"
"If the dog is still misbehaving after several weeks, your veterinarian may recommend a trained behavioral therapist for a more intense training program.

"A dog’s mouth is made up mainly of two bones, the mandible (lower bone) and the maxilla (upper bone). These two bones come together at a joint called the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The TMJ is the joint that allows the jaw to open and close. Dogs use their cheek muscles to move the TMJ in order to open and close their mouths.
"
"Craniomandibular osteopathy is a condition by which extra bone forms along the mandible and TMJ, making it painful and difficult for the affected dog to open its mouth and eat. Signs are usually seen in puppies that are four to eight months of age, and it is seen more in some breeds of dogs than others. Breeds that are the most commonly affected are Scottish Terriers, Cairn Terriers, and West Highland White Terriers. Breeds with a lesser incidence of this condition, but which also have a higher than normal diagnosis are Labrador Retrievers, Great Danes, Boston Terriers, Doberman Pinschers, Irish Setters, English Bulldogs, and Boxers.
"
"Inherited. The genetic predisposition is strongest with West Highland white terriers.
"
"Your veterinarian will need a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Paying careful attention to your dog's head during the examination. your veterinarian may be able to feel a decrease in the amount of muscle on the sides of your dog's head, along with a thickening of the bone along the sides of the jaws. There will also be obvious pain when trying to open your dog's mouth, and it may not even open all the way.
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and biochemistry levels. These will be used to identify whether there are any abnormalities in your dog's bones. Further blood tests may help to rule out or verify fungal or other types of infection. The most precise diagnostic tool for this condition will be x-rays images taken of your dog's head, which will show the abnormal bone growth. In most cases these will be all of the tests that need to be done, but for some cases, your veterinarian may also want to get a sample of the bone (bone biopsy) to make sure your dog's symptoms are not caused by a tumor or bone infection.
"
"
"
"Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs for the swelling, along with pain relievers, will help to minimize your dog's symptoms but will not effect an immediate cure. This condition has a “wait and see” outlook, since there is no method for slowing the progression other than for treating the swelling. The growth typically slows down at about a year of age, when the puppy's growth slows, and the growth will often recede as well, but many dogs will continue to have a larger than normal jaw bone, and may have difficulty chewing normally for the remainder of their lives. In some cases, surgery may be used to repair the jaw enough to make your dog more comfortable.
"
"You may need to feed your dog a special food during the treatment process, such as a high calorie soup or liquid if it is having trouble eating regular food. If your dog cannot eat even a liquid diet, surgical placement of a feeding tube into the stomach or esophagus will be necessary. Because prescribed medications can sometimes cause an upset stomach, it is important that you follow all of the instructions you are given about these medications.
"
"Your veterinarian will want you to return for regular follow-up visits to make sure your dog is getting enough nutrition and is not in excessive pain. If you need to feed your dog through a tube, it is important that you follow all of your veterinarian’s instructions regarding how to use the tube and how often to feed your pet. Once your pet reaches ten to twelve months of age, the pain may decrease. The amount of extra bone which has built up on the jaw may decrease as well. How well your dog does will depend on the amount of extra bone which has formed around the jaw. Your pet may still need special food, or a feeding tube for the rest of its life.
"
"Dogs that are affected with craniomandibular osteopathy should not be used for breeding again, nor should siblings from the same litter, whether they have symptoms of the disorder or not. And it is recommended that you have your dog spayed or neutered to avoid passing this genetic abnormality along.

"Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) in dogs is a neurological condition that involves the spinal cord, the vertebrae, or back bones (the small, round bones that make up the spinal column or spine), and the disc material between each vertebra.
"
"Jaundice—also known as icterus—is characterized by the yellowing discoloration of a dog’s gums, eyes, skin, and blood. This is a result of an increased accumulation of bilirubin (orange-yellow pigment formed in the liver), a condition known as hyperbilirubinemia.
"
"Hyperbilirubinemia is a symptom of a more severe underlying condition and can be life-threatening, making it a medical emergency.
"
"Jaundice can occur due to an increase in bilirubin creation, often associated with the damage of red blood cells, or decreased removal from the body, which is seen in cases of liver and gallbladder disease.
"
"Any disease that affects red blood cells, the liver, and/or the gallbladder can significantly affect bilirubin creation, thereby leading to jaundice. Though it’s often referred to in the same context as liver disease, it is important to understand that jaundice can occur due to other diseases.
"
"Unfortunately, jaundice is a common occurrence in dogs and a common cause of humane euthanasia. While jaundice itself is not contagious, there are some underlying causes that can be contagious, or even zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to people. This is seen in diseases such as leptospirosis. 
"
"Due to the diverse range of conditions that can cause jaundice as a symptom, your dog may also experience some of the following:
"
"Fever
"
"The vertebrae protect the spinal cord and the nerves that transmit impulses to and from the brain and the rest of the body. The spine also supports the weight and movement of the body. When something is wrong with the spine, it causes pain or even immobility. In between each vertebra is a soft, jelly-like disc surrounded by thick fibrous tissue. This intervertebral material serves as a cushion to absorb shock and help provide flexibility to the body as it moves.
"
"IVDD in dogs is a condition that occurs when the cushioning discs between the bones of the spinal column either bulge or burst into the space containing the spinal cord. When this disc material pushes on the spinal cord, it can cause pain, nerve damage, and even paralysis. This condition is also known as a slipped disc, herniated disc, or bulging disc.
"
"Certain dog breeds that have a long back and short legs, including Dachshund, Basset Hound, Shih Tzu, French Bulldog, Lhasa Apso, Pekingese, and Beagle, are predisposed to IVDD. The disease has also been known to occur in large-breed dogs, such as German Shepherds, because with age disc degeneration occurs.
"
"Hansen Type I and Hansen Type II are the two main types of disease that affect the intervertebral disc, each causing a disc to press painfully against the spinal cord:
"
"Hansen Type I occurs when the soft, jelly-like center of the disc becomes hardened. With one wrong jump or sudden impact, this rock-like disc shoots out of its thick shell and pushes upward into the spinal cord and its surrounding nerves. This movement of the disc material (called a herniation) causes compression and bruising of the spinal cord. This is a very sudden, sharp pain with varying degrees of reduced nerve function.
"
"Type I disc disease is most common in Dachshunds and other similar breeds with the same body structure.
"
"Hansen Type II involves a much slower degenerative process, where the disc material impinges on the spinal cord and spinal nerves over time from a matter of months to years. The thick fibers around the soft disc material will slowly collapse over time and push upward. This causes more long-term pain and spinal cord compression.
"
"Type II disc disease is common in German Shepherds and other large breed dogs.
"
"Clinical signs of IVDD depend on the type of disc herniation and location in the spinal column. Starting at the neck and moving toward the tail are five regions of the spine—the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal vertebrae. The most common sites of disc herniation in dogs are at the end of the thoracic vertebrae (T11-T12) and the beginning of the lumbar vertebrae (L2-L3). These herniations are painful impact a dog’s ability to move. Cervical (neck) herniations are less common, but if they do occur it’s almost always in Dachshunds, Beagles, or Poodles and they tend to create more pain but less loss of function.
"
"Symptoms of IVDD include:
"
"Limping or lameness, unsteady walking
"
"Dragging back legs
"
"Stumbling over back feet
"
"Hunched back or neck with tense muscles
"
"Weakness
"
"Pain
"
"Unwillingness to jump
"
"Anxious behavior (e.g., shivering, panting)
"
"Decreased activity level
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Loss of bladder and/or bowel control (urinary and/or fecal incontinence)
"
"Difficulty posturing to urinate/defecate
"
"Paralysis­ (i.e., complete loss of function in front or hind limbs)
"
"Decreased appetite and weight loss
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Lethargy or decreased energy
"
"Increased thirst and urination
"
"Bruising or pinpoint hemorrhages (petechiae)
"
"Abdominal swelling and pain
"
"Weak pulse
"
"Increased heart rate
"
"Behavioral changes
"
"Seizures
"
"Head pressing and circling
"
"As bilirubin levels rise, jaundice is first noticed in a dog’s blood. With the progression of the disease, the yellowing of the eyes, gums, and skin becomes increasingly noticeable. Because jaundice is a symptom of several diseases, diagnosing the root cause can be difficult for veterinarians.
"
"Some causes of jaundice may include:
"
"Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) or other conditions known to cause destruction of red blood cells
"
"Infections:
"
"Fungal diseases such as histoplasmosis
"
"Tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis
"
"Leptospirosis, a bacterial disease
"
"Parasites, such as liver flukes and Babesia canis
"
"Viral infections such as adenovirus
"
"Snakebite venom
"
"Toxins:
"
"Onions and garlic
"
"Zinc, often attributed to ingestion of certain pennies
"
"Tylenol®
"
"Aflatoxins
"
"Sago palm
"
"IVDD is the result of a herniated disc and compression of the spinal cord. In chondrodystrophic dog breeds (those with a hereditary cartilage development abnormality), that include Dachshunds, Corgis, and Bassett Hounds, IVDD is commonly caused by an acute or sudden rupture of the disc material. While wear and tear damages the disc over time, the rupture generally occurs suddenly as the result of a forceful impact (e.g., jumping, landing).
"
"In large-breed dogs, such as Shepherds, Labradors, and Doberman Pinschers, the discs become hardened over a longer period, eventually bulging or rupturing to cause spinal cord compression. This type happens gradually, and a specific forceful impact won’t be the cause of damage.
"
"If you suspect your dog is having any back pain or difficulty getting around, have it examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible. With IVDD, the sooner you treat the problem the better the chance for a full recovery.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical and neurological examination including baseline blood and urine testing to assess your dog’s overall health. Based on the results of the examination, if IVDD is suspected your vet will likely recommend imaging tests to visualize the spine and surrounding tissues to determine the severity of the condition.
"
"Plain radiographs (X-rays) are taken of the spine to look for areas of narrowing joint spaces in between the vertebrae, but X-rays do not show the spinal cord. An MRI can better identify the location of a spinal cord compression and material in the vertebral canal. MRI has become the technique of choice for the diagnosis of IVDD because it allows scanning of the whole spine so that the discs and spinal cord can be assessed in the same image. Depending on the severity of clinical signs and indications for surgery, other diagnostic tools including myelography, or computed tomography/CT scan) can further investigate the type of herniation and its location.
"
"Depending on the severity of the damage to your dog’s spinal cord, treatment can range from medical management to emergency surgery.
"
"In mild cases of IVDD, treatment focuses on reducing pain, inflammation, and swelling. This is achieved using medications and strict confinement. Your dog should be in a crate or a small area where they cannot run, jump, play, or perform any exercise. The timeline of strict rest depends on the specific injury and rate of healing. Often, physical therapy is recommended to help speed recovery.
"
"If the damage is severe and the dog has a degree of paralysis, surgical correction of the herniation is typically suggested. This is usually an emergency surgery to minimize any permanent neurologic damage. The goal of surgery is to evaluate the herniation and relieve the pressure on the spinal cord. This is done by removing a portion of the bony vertebra over the affected part of the spinal cord (called a laminectomy).
"
"After surgery, the same activity restrictions apply, focusing on conservative management to allow the spinal cord to heal. Unfortunately, even with surgery, some dogs will not regain function and will have lasting neurological issues.
"
"IVDD surgery itself can cost between $2,000 and $5,000, depending on where you live and the individual veterinary office. This does not include pre-op and post-op treatment, consultations, lab work, medications, or other added potential costs that may be needed to treat the condition.
"
"Prognosis varies significantly depending on the degree and the location of the injury. Most disc ruptures entail minimal neurological issues and the pup patient will have an excellent chance to return to walking. However, if the pet has lost the ability to sense pain in its legs before surgery is performed, it may never walk again.
"
"The spinal cord recovers slowly, and extra care must be taken to prohibit running, jumping, going up or down stairs, playing with other dogs, and hopping on or off furniture. If your dog is diagnosed with a mild to moderate IVDD injury, treatment may include steroid and anti-inflammatory medications to help reduce pain and swelling, combined with strictly reduced activity for approximately four to six weeks. Recovery from IVDD surgery requires six to eight weeks of restricted activity.
"
"It is not uncommon for a dog (mainly Dachshunds) to have additional herniations in other regions of the spine after surgery. Though it is difficult to prevent future disc herniations, the likelihood can be limited by avoiding activities such as jumping and explosive movements (e.g., frisbee, stairs). Dogs with back problems should be kept at a healthy weight to allow a quicker recovery from surgery and to avoid future strain on the back.
"
"Surgery outcomes are most successful in dogs that have not lost their ability to walk. If your dog’s surgery is not successful in returning them to normal mobility, a dog wheelchair can help your pup enjoy a happy and active life while living with IVDD.

"
"These tests can be useful in detecting and diagnosing the underlying cause of jaundice. Since jaundice is a symptom that is easily detected during a routine physical exam, your veterinarian will be able to narrow down the list of tests needed to expedite a diagnosis. 
"
"To provide a definitive diagnosis, your vet may need to take a sample of your dog’s liver. This can be done either surgically or through an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy, where a needle is inserted directly into the liver.
"
"The samples obtained can be submitted for culture (to detect evidence of bacterial infection), histopathology (to examine cell and tissue structure), or toxicology.

"Feeding tubes, which might be recommended to slow disease progression and provide the liver with time to regenerate. 
"
"When jaundice is attributed to diseases affecting red blood cells, blood transfusions may be necessary, along with long-term immunosuppression using steroids or other medications like azathioprine or cyclosporine.
"
"Certain conditions such as cancer, portosystemic shunts, gallbladder stones/mucoceles, and bile duct obstruction may be amendable with chemotherapy or surgery. 
"
"Since the liver plays a vital role in digestion and nutrient metabolism, providing a diet that lessens stress on the liver can be helpful. The diet should be highly palatable and provide enough calories for a dog to maintain body weight, or easy to digest. Depending on the underlying cause, some dogs may be prescribed special diets like Hill’s® l/d or Royal Canin® Hepatic, which are formulated to provide adequate protein, more antioxidants, and lower amounts of certain minerals like copper that can be harmful to a dog’s liver.
"
"Smaller, more frequent meals may be accepted more easily by your dog. Be sure to discuss an appropriate diet for your dog with your veterinarian. 
"
"The liver has the unique ability to regenerate, and for certain diseases, when caught early and treated aggressively, dogs can have a good prognosis and go on to live a normal life. Conditions like gallbladder mucoceles and certain types of infections and toxin ingestions are good examples.
"
"Other conditions, such as IMHA or acquired liver shunts, can be managed with lifelong medications and diet.
"
"It’s important that you adhere to your veterinarian’s recommendations and recheck guidelines since these dogs will require ongoing monitoring. 
"
"For some dogs with extensive disease or a poor prognosis, humane euthanasia may be recommended by your vet.
"
"Most diseases that lead to jaundice in dogs are not preventable, but there are some that can be avoided. Here are some tips for reducing your dog’s risk:
"
"Do not administer any human medications or improper dosages of drugs to your dog and keep these items securely out of your dog’s reach. 
"
"Keep your dog on tick prevention, check regularly for ticks, and stay current with vaccinations, particularly for leptospirosis. 
"
"Take steps to avoid sources of possible bacterial contamination:
"
"Restrict access to standing water.
"
"Avoid contact with wildlife.
"
"Use pest control as needed.
"
"Control and prevent access to garbage.
"
"Treatment for jaundice requires proper diagnosis and therapy of the underlying disease process, which requires veterinary expertise.
"
"Dogs with jaundice are seriously ill and should be evaluated immediately. Do not delay getting your dog the care they need!

"Dog noses are fascinating little structures. Not only do dogs use their noses for breathing, dog noses also drain excessive tears from the eyes through tear ducts. In addition, they have sweat glands, which help to cool the body through sweating.
"
"Dog noses are also involved in collecting information about the environment. They do this through sniffing, but not all of the “information” is carried through the nasal passage. When a dog licks her nose, she transfers all sorts of scents to specialized scent detection olfactory glands located on the roof the mouth. This allows the dog to process her environment.
"
"Check out your dog the next time she is intently sniffing something; you will notice that she sniff, sniff, sniffs, and then licks her nose, transferring all the information about what other dogs, cats, squirrels, or other creatures might have left — a “scent mail”, if you will — for her to read.
"
"Clients often ask me if their dog’s nose is warm and dry, does that mean the dog is sick? Not necessarily, I tell them. Some dogs have dry noses because they just don’t lick their noses often. Sometimes, however, a dog will have a warm, dry nose in relation to a fever, but it can get tricky. That is because if a dog has the flu, she can have a fever with a warm, dry, nose, or a wet, runny nose.
"
"Dogs can also lick their noses excessively due to neurological conditions (partial seizures), excessive anxiety, behavioral reasons (dogs will lick their muzzles to signal submission), or because their nose itches from allergies.
"
"If your dog is acting sick, feels warm, seems to licking her nose excessively, and/or is coughing or sneezing, then it is time to the see your veterinarian to figure out what is wrong, and then fix it.
"
"There are some diseases that can cause a chronically dry nose. Auto-immune disorders, such as lupus or pemphigus, can cause changes in the surface of the nose that leads to dryness, cracking, and bleeding.
"
"Auto-immune disorders are diagnosed with blood and urine testing, and a biopsy of the nose. They are treated with immuno-suppressive drugs, such as prednisone.
"
"Severe allergic reactions to pollen, mold, food, etc. can lead to redness and swelling of the nose, as well as to excessive rubbing and scratching of the face. Allergies can be treated with anti-histamines, and in severe cases, steroids must also be prescribed.
"
"Excessive sun exposure, especially in dogs that have pink skin, can cause sunburned skin on the nose that can peel and crack.
"
"Still other dogs, especially brachycephalic breeds such as Pugs and Bulldogs, can’t lick their nose very well because of the conformation of their skull. These dogs will often develop a lumpy, crusty, chalky, cracked, uncomfortable nose in place of the cute little black button that used to sit on their face.
"
"For a case of chronically dry nose, your dog may benefit from a prescription lotion specifically designed to hydrate and nourish the skin on the nose.
"
"Because dogs are nose lickers, whatever lotion is used must be safe for ingestion. Most skin lotions that are sold over the counter are not safe for ingestion. It is for this reason that I do not recommend treating the nose with any over the counter lotions unless your veterinarian has specifically recommended it to you.
"
"If you notice changes in the way the skin on your dog’s nose looks, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian to discuss options in diagnosis and treatment.

"In order to pump blood to the lungs and body, the heart must work in a coordinated fashion. The heart has an electrical conduction system that is responsible for controlling the heart rate. This electrical conduction system generates electrical impulses (waves), which propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body. There are two nodes (masses of tissue) present in the heart that play an important role in this conduction system. The sinus node, or sinoatrial (SA) node, is a clustered collection of similar cells located in the right atrium, its purpose being to generate electrical impulses and to serve as the heart's pacemaker. The other node is called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Like the SA node, it is a clustered collection of similar cells situated in the right atrium, close to the ventricle. The AV node receives impulses from the SA node, and after a small delay, directs the impulses to the ventricles. This delay allows for the atrium to eject blood into the ventricle before the ventricular muscles contract. The AV node can also take the place of the SA node as the heart's pacemaker, should the SA node be affected adversely by a pathological condition of the heart.
"
"Ventricular premature complexes are a type of irregular heart beat. An electrical impulse is initiated within the ventricles instead of the SA node, causing the ventricles to contract too early (thus the “premature” in ventricular premature complexes).
"
"Ventricular premature complexes on a recording of an electrocardiogram (ECG) are characterized by abnormal (too wide and/or oddly shaped) QRS complexes, the state that indicates the change in electrical potential in a single heartbeat. They are not associated with P waves.
"
"Other factors that may predispose a dog to ventricular premature complexes are:
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The electrolyte panel will show if there is hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. If present, bloodwork will also confirm pancreatitis.
"
"An echocardiogram of the heart should be performed to check for structural heart disease. Long-term ambulatory (Holter) recording of the ECG can be done to detect transient ventricular arrhythmias in patients with unexplained fainting or weakness.
"
"
"
"Most patients can be treated on an outpatient basis. However, patients with an electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) should be hospitalized temporarily for  fluid therapy with electrolytes to correct the imbalance. Oxygen therapy will need to be given if your dog is hypoxemic. Your veterinarian may prescribe anti-arrhythmic drugs to your dog, depending on the underlying cause of the ventricular premature complexes.
"
"The prognosis is uncertain and depends on whether the underlying cause can be treated. Be aware that the arrhythmia may worsen and/or fainting or sudden death can occur. If the heart has a structural disease (which your veterinarian will inform you of, if this is the case) or if your dog is showing clinical signs of the arrhythmia, you will need to restrict your dog's activity. Your doctor will advise you on an appropriate physical routine, and will schedule follow-up appointments with you for your dog as is necessary to treat the underlying disease.

"When the sinus node's conduction impulses are blocked or inhibited from reaching the ventricles, the role of pacemaker is taken over by the lower heart, resulting in indioventricular rhythm, or ventricular escape complexes; that is, irregular heartbeats. Accelerated idioventricular rhythms occur mainly due to a fluctuation in the heartbeat. Sometimes the ECG reading will show a dog's heart beat rate at less than 65 beats per minute (bpm). The normal rate for dogs is 70-180 bpm – but varies according to age and breed. For puppies, the rate is 70-120 bpm, and for toy breeds, the rate is 70-220 bpm.
"
"This electrical conduction system generates electrical impulses (waves), which propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body.

This delay allows for the atrium to eject blood into the ventricle before the ventricular muscles contract.
"
"Clinical examination will show an ECG reading a P wave that is absent or is hidden between the QRS complex (the recorded measurement for a single heartbeat). Rarely does it come after the QRRS complex; the P wave is generally found occurring in the wrong place (ectopic). There is no connection between the P waves and the QRS complex on the ECG graph. Arrangement of the complex QRS is disoriented. It is very wide and  aligns with the complex of the premature ventricular system.
"
"Only dogs that have a weak body mechanism or underlying disease will suffer from this disease, healthy dogs are not affected by this disorder. In addition, this disease does occur due to gene organization and does not appear to have any hereditary basis. However, a disposition has been found to occur in some breeds more than others. For example, Springer Spaniels are known to present with atrial standstill – an absence of electrical activity in the atria, which shuts down the heart mechanism and affects the blood flow. In addition, other breeds, like Pugs, Dalmatians, and the Schnauzers, are known to suffer conduction irregularities. The prevalence of this disease has not yet been determined.
"
"Although there are some cases where there are no visible symptoms whatsoever, some of the more typical ones include:
"
"Sinus bradycardia or sinus arrest
"
"AV block
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. Any previous illnesses, especially those that required medication, will need to be covered fro your veterinarian to make a prompt and accurate diagnosis. Standard laboratory tests include a complete blood profile, a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The blood test will show any metabolic abnormalities that are present in your dog's body. Your veterinarian will also check for possible side effects due to medications, such as digoxin, tranquilizers, or anethetics that have been used to treat your dog.
"
"An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat), or may show a structural heart problem. If a mass is suspected it can be visualized on X-Ray or ultrasound, and in the case that one is found, your veterinarian may need to take a sample of the mass for biopsy.
"
"Slow heart beat rate, and varying P and QRS waves can also help in diagnosing idioventricular rhythm.
"
"
"
"Idioventricular rhythm does not have any standard treatment since it is a secondary disease. That is, it is secondary to another underlying condition, it does not exist as a solitary condition. The underlying condition will need to be treated, along with treatment that is done to alleviate the outward symptoms. The focus will be on increasing the heart rate and maintaining a stable rhythm. Medications may be prescribed for increasing the heart rate, or for blocking the vagal tone. If the medication therapy is not effective, a pacemaker implant may be used for maintaining the heartbeat and stabilizing the heart valves.

"Your dog will need a lot of rest in order to recover properly. Cage rest is recommended in this case, since it can both give an animal a sense of security, and prevent the animal from overexerting itself. There is no need to alter your dog's diet plan, unless there is a specific health concern that would lead your veterinarian to make that recommendation. If the underlying cause cannot be diagnosed or treated, the prognosis for recovery is guarded to poor. One of the possible serious complications is congestive heart failure due to a prolonged state of bradycardia.

"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in dogs is a condition where the intestinal muscles don’t function normally, and it causes diarrhea and constipation. True IBS is not common in dogs. Irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, which means that there is no cause that can be found for a dog’s diarrhea through testing.
"
"Irritable bowel syndrome in dogs causes two main symptoms: diarrhea and constipation. Typically, the diarrhea is very watery with some form to no form. The diarrhea or constipation can be chronic, or it can resolve with repeated episodes. Each episode can come on quickly, and the dog can have a painful abdomen, gas, and borborygmi, which is a “gas bubble” sound in their stomach.
"
"Arrhythmia is caused by an abnormal variation in the cycling of impulses that regulate the heart's beating action, resulting in an irregular rhythm. The heart may beat too fast, too slow, or it may skip beats. An irregular heart beat is the primary symptom of arrhythmia.
"
"The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat, or contract, by firing off electrical surges (also called the heart's pacemaker). The sinus discharge rate depends on two opposing influences of the nervous system: stimulation from the vagus nerves (nerves that originate in the lower brain stem [medulla] and send signals to the autonomic organs of the body) decreases the spontaneous discharge rate and predominates over sympathetic stimulation (mediating the neuronal and hormonal stress response commonly known as the fight-or-flight response). During inhalation, feedback from the respiratory and cardiac centers produce cardiac acceleration by decreasing restraints on the vagus nerves; the opposite occurs during exhalation.
"
"Sinus arrhythmia also depends on reflexes involving stretch receptors in the lung, pressure-volume sensory receptors in the heart, blood vessels, and chemical factors of the blood. There is generally no consequence in blood flow, but marked sinus arrhythmia may produce a long enough pause in the heart's beating action to produce loss of consciousness if not accompanied by an escape rhythm.
"
"Arrhythmia is relatively common in dogs and is not always a cause for concern. An occasional irregular heart beat may not cause any other health problems. However, because an irregular beat may be an early symptom of a more serious underlying condition, it is wise to have it checked out by your veterinarian. Some breeds appear to be predisposed to sinus arrhythmia, most notably brachycephalic breeds like bulldogs, lhasa apsos, Pekingese, pugs, shar-peis, shih tzus, and boxers.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to whether there are any underlying disorders, or if there are other organs that are being affected by this disorder. This information may help to make the diagnosis that much easier to conclude.
"
"An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). X-rays of the head and neck may be used to assess for abnormal anatomic conformation that might predispose your dog to airway problems. If upper airway disease is suspected, your veterinarian can use a minimally invasive technique called a pharyngoscopy or laryngoscopy, by which a tubular device with a camera attached is inserted into the respiratory tract (pharynx and larynx, respectively) in order to visually examine the space.
"
"Generally, specific treatment is required only when the disorder is associated with symptomatic slow heartbeat. If it is not related to respiration, the underlying cause will be treated. If your dog is suffering respiratory distress, it will need to be hospitalized until it is stable. Activity will not be restricted unless the specific disease calls for it (e.g., brachycephalic animals may need to limit exercise, especially in high ambient temperatures). Your veterinarian will recommend caloric restriction if your dog is overweight,since this can severely compromise the airway. The only medications required will be those that are used for treating the underlying cause.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule you to bring your dog in for rechecks only if there is a specific disease that requires it. If your dog has a common type of arrhythmia, that is, an occasional heart beat irregularity, and the health is not being compromised, you will not need further treatment beyond the regular scheduled health check-ups.
"
"Irritable bowel syndrome in dogs is a primary motility disorder. This means that the muscles of the intestines do not contract in a normal manner.
"
"Normal intestine muscle moves in a rhythmic pattern called peristalsis that moves food from the mouth to the anus. In irritable bowel syndrome, the muscles don’t contract in unison, or they move too fast or too slow.
"
"The root of the abnormal motility seen in IBS can be food intolerance or stress-related. 
"
"Unfortunately, the symptoms of IBS in dogs are also the symptoms of hundreds of other diseases. IBS is considered a diagnosis of exclusion, which means that your veterinarian has to rule out many other diseases before being able to say that your dog has IBS. 
"
"Typically, this starts with bloodwork to look for abnormal blood cell counts or abnormal levels of liver and kidney enzymes. Tests might also include:
"
"Imaging of the abdomen, with x-rays or an ultrasound, to check for tumors, abnormal structure of the intestines, blockages, severe constipation, and abnormal movement of the intestines
"
"Blood tests to look at pancreas functions
"
"A biopsy of the intestines  
"
"A culture of the feces to check for bacterial infection
"
"PCR testing for viruses  
"
"A final important part of diagnosing IBS in dogs is starting a diet trial and seeing what response your dog has to the diet.
"
"Once your veterinarian has determined that your dog has IBS, it can be managed through medication and food. When your dog is having an episode of IBS, the use of antidiarrheal medication and probiotics helps to stop diarrhea and balance the gut microbiota.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend a diet change. Feeding a diet that is highly digestible and has a higher fiber content helps to alleviate inflammation in the gut and stop diarrhea. Diets such as Royal Canin® Gastrointestinal High Fiber or Hill®’s Prescription Diet w/d are highly digestible and have fiber to help make intestinal movement normal and prevent diarrhea and constipation.
"
"Irritable bowel syndrome in dogs is commonly triggered by a stressful event. Avoiding stress, or preparing a pet for stress with the use of medications can help prevent or lessen the severity of episodes.
"
"Many dogs will recover from IBS episodes within one week with treatment. Some dogs will continue to have problems with IBS and even with treatment; these dogs will require a prescription diet for life to help prevent future episodes.
"
"Dogs with IBS should be fed a highly digestible diet with a high soluble fiber content. Generally, this will be a prescription diet such as Royal Canin® Gastrointestinal High Fiber or Hill®’s Prescription Diet w/d. 
"
"IBS causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, or constipation. It has no cause that can be found—there is no bacteria or viral agent present, and biopsies of the intestine show no inflammation or cancer present. IBS is often caused by stressful events and mostly affects the large intestine.
"
"IBD, on the other hand, affects the large and small intestine, and on biopsy, there are inflammatory cells present. IBD causes vomiting and diarrhea. IBS can occur in episodes, while IBD is a chronic disease that requires lifelong therapy.
"
"True IBS is rare in dogs. The symptoms of IBS—diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain—are common with many other diseases, so it is important to have your dog evaluated if they have these symptoms to determine the appropriate treatment.

"Sometimes referred to as iris cysts or uveal cysts, iridociliary cysts are often benign and require no treatment. However, occasionally they may be large enough to interfere with vision or with the function of the eye.
"
"Iridiociliary cysts may be attached to various parts of the interior of the eye. They may be lightly or darkly pigmented and are semitransparent. They may be spherical to ovoid in shape. They can vary considerably in size and there may be more than one. They may be seen in one or both eyes.
"
"In most cases, these cysts are an incidental finding. Only when they are large enough to impair vision or interfere with the normal functioning of the eye are they problematic. Glaucoma can be a complication associated with iridociliary cysts.
"
"Cysts may be congenital or acquired.
"
"There is a breed predilection in Boston terriers, golden retrievers and Labrador retrievers for iridociliary cysts. In golden retrievers, a syndrome of pigmentary uveitis and iridociliary cysts is seen. These cysts have also been associated with glaucoma in golden retrievers and in Great Danes.
"
"Iridociliary cysts are diagnosed with an ocular examination.
"
"
"
"In most cases, no treatment is necessary. If uveitis or glaucoma is present, these diseases will need to be treated appropriately. Laser coagulation can be used to remove particularly large cysts if necessary.

"A reovirus infection is caused by a group of viruses that contain double-stranded RNA (ribonucleic acid), and which have special characteristics with respect to their genetic material. This infection limits the absorption of nutrients from the intestines and results in diarrhea and dehydration.
"
"Located within the dog's intestinal walls, they will destroy  of dogs and cats, destroying cells in the area they reside in. As a result there is limited absorption of nutrition from the intestines, further resulting in diarrhea and dehydration.
"
"The virus is transmitted through contact with infected feces, or by inhalation of airborne virus particles. These viruses can suppress the immune system, causing the affected animal to develop various infections. The dog's outward conditions, meanwhile, will vary and depend on the type of reovirus.
"
"Reovirus infections can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this intestinal virus affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"A dog with a reovirus infection will usually have mild symptoms such as diarrhea, irritation and inflammation of the nose, and cold-like symptoms (rhinitis). However, it may succumb to more serious complications, including conjunctivitis, pneumonia, infection of the brain tissue (encephalitis), and respiratory tract irritation.
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct a full physical examination and complete blood profile on the dog, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Diagnostic procedures will be aimed at differentiating a reoviral infection from other milder respiratory infections that are caused by bacteria.
"
"Your doctor will also need to include a detailed study of the tissue characteristics, along with the viral structure, in order to confirm a diagnosis.

"Synechiae are adhesions between the iris and other structures in the eye. Iris bombe occurs when there is a complete adhesion between the iris and the capsule of the lens of the eye creating a 360 degree area of adhesion. This results in a billowing of the iris forward into the eye.
"
"Iris bombe can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of eye problem affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"Symptoms seen with iris bombe include:
"
"Diagnosis is based on an ophthalmic examination, which involves examining the structures of the eye. Tonometry may be performed to measure the intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball.)
"
"
"
"In some cases, treatment may not be necessary. However, when glaucoma occurs, it must be treated. In cases like this, laser surgery may be necessary to release the adhesions.

"The double-stranded, wheel-shaped rotavirus causes inflammation of the intestines and in severe cases, dysfunction in the intestinal walls. It is the leading cause of diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset in dogs. And although it can be seen in dogs at any age, puppies are more prone to rotavirus infections, especially those less than 12 weeks old.
"
"Cats are also susceptible to rotavirus infections. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"The primary symptom of a rotavirus infection is mild to moderate watery diarrhea. In severe cases, dogs may die from dehydration, extreme weight loss, and/or an unwillingness to eat. Dogs may also exhibit fatigue or lethargy.
"
"The rotavirus is typically transmitted through contact with contaminated fecal matter. Dogs with underdeveloped or weak immune systems and those living in overly stressed environments are most at risk for the infection.
"
"In dogs, your doctor will likely try to rule out other conditions before diagnosing rotavirus. Some causes for inflammation of the intestine may include parvovirus (a rash disease), coronavirus (a virus affecting the intestines), astrovirus (causes diarrhea), herpesvirus, distemper virus, and canine reovirus (also called kennel cough).
"
"Lab tests to detect the virus may include laboratory examination of tissue samples, or microscopic exploration of feces. One such test is ELISA (or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), a biochemical technique. Your veterinarian may also be able to identify the virus using a technique called virus isolation.
"
"To formally diagnose rotavirus, a veterinarian will examine the intestinal villi (the small hairs lining the intestine) and other cells within the intestinal wall, using special instruments to detect the rotavirus and antibodies the virus may have produced.
"
"
"
"Once the rotavirus is formally diagnosed, your veterinarian will begin treatment to ensure a prompt recovery. Treatment involves symptomatic relief to relieve the dog's diarrhea and to help replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Your doctor will also advise temporary dietary restrictions to help alleviate some of your dog's intestinal discomfort.
"
"Antibiotics are generally not prescribed because they are only useful for bacterial, not viral infections.
"
"Because rotaviruses are zoonotic, it is important that pet owners keep infected dogs away from young children, infants in particular. When handling the fecal matter of an infected animal, it is especially important to use precautions, such as wearing latex gloves and disinfecting the animal's living area.
"
"Humans living in developing countries are most at risk, often experiencing life-threatening diarrhea. Estimates suggest that in developing countries up to 500,000 children under age five die every year from rotavirus infections.
"
"The best protection for a puppy is to consume the milk of an immune bitch, as they produce antibodies that may protect against the rotavirus.

"As it is generally not a life threatening condition, reovirus vaccines have not been developed, and medications are usually not prescribed for these infections. Treatment, instead, will focus on ensuring you dog remains hydrated, that its airways are clear, and that its nervous system is functioning properly.
"
"If any of the dog's body systems are disordered, your veterinarian will prescribe medication to treat its specific ailment.
"
"Follow your veterinarian's advice and avoid exposing any other healthy pets to your dog. Some reoviruses are contagious, even infect children and infants at times. Therefore, it probably best to isolate your dog until it has recovered.
"
"Be aware that some respiratory symptoms may return during your pet's recovery period. If these complications should become serious, bring your dog back to the veterinarian immediately.

"Strongyloidiasis is an intestinal infection with the parasite Strongyloides stercoralis (S. canis). Typically, only the female nematode will be present in the dog's intestinal lining, causing, among other things, severe diarrhea. S. stercoralis is relatively host-specific, but there is a potential for transmission to humans.
"
"There are several ways your dog may become infected with S. stercoralis, including skin penetration, ingestion of contaminated feces, and nursing from an infected bitch. There is an increased prevalence of stronglyoidiasis in kennels, especially when there is poor sanitation and high temperatures and humidity.
"
"The challenge your veterinarian will face will be distinguishing the cause of the dog's symptoms, which may be due to several other parasites or bacteria or viruses. He or she may culture a sample of your dog's feces, or perform a colonoscopy on the animal to identify the infective agent.
"
"
"
"Unless intravenous fluid supplementation is needed to stabilize your dehydrated dog, it will be treated as an outpatient. Preferred anthelmintic medication, which destroy and remove internal parasites, include ivermectin and fenbendazole.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to schedule monthly fecal examinations monthly for the first six months after treatment to assure clearance of infection. During this time, your dog will intermittently shed parasitic larvae and require regular deworming sessions. He or she will also recommend a thorough cleaning of your pet's area and/or kennel to eradicate any potential larvae. You should, however, take precaution when handling the dog or items used by the animal, as humans can sometimes become infected with S. stercoralis., causing rashes, severe abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea.

"A leiomyoma is a relatively harmless and non-spreading tumor that arises from the smooth muscle of the stomach and intestinal tract. The main concern is that this type of tumor can block the normal progress of fluids and solids through the digestive tract, or displace organs, resulting in secondary health complications. It typically occurs in middle-aged to older dogs, generally over six years of age. Otherwise, there is no gender or breed predisposition.

"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. He or she will first be looking for evidence of a foreign body in the digestive tract, or an inflammatory bowel disease, parasitic infection, or pancreatitis. 
"
"Once a tumor has been confirmed, your veterinarian will need to differentiate it from a cancerous gland tumor. There are different types of cancerous tumors that can affect the digestive tract, including leiomyosarcoma, a cancer that grows from the smooth muscle of the digestive tract; and lymphoma, a solid neoplasm that originates in the lymphocytes -- a type of white blood cell in the bloodstream.
"
"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your doctor may need to order an abdominal ultrasound, which may reveal a thickened wall of the stomach or bowel. Gastric leiomyoma is most common at the esophageal–gastric junction, where the esophagus meets the stomach cavity. If necessary, a special imaging technique called a contrast study may be used. This study will involve giving the dog an oral dose of liquid material (barium) that shows up on X-rays. Films are then taken at various stages to examine the passage of the barium through the body. This technique may reveal a space-occupying mass in the digestive tract. Double-contrast radiography of the large intestine and rectum may also be used to reveal a space-occupying mass in these organs.
"
"Your veterinarian may also perform an upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, by which a flexible tube with an attached camera is inserted into the space to be examined, in this case the gastrointestinal tract, allowing the doctor to visually inspect the space for abnormalities. These devices also have attachments for gathering samples of tissue and fluid, so that a biopsy can be performed to confirm the preemptive diagnosis. If a tumor is suspected, your doctor will need to perform a mucosal biopsy, and if possible, will take a tissue sample of the mass in the gastrointestinal tract. This method is often not useful for the diagnosis of deep tumors. In these cases, a more invasive surgical biopsy is often required to confirm the diagnosis.
"
"
"
"Surgical resection (removal) is the treatment of choice. This method is generally curative if the tumor can be removed safely. In many cases, owing to their benign nature, even large leiomyomas with narrow margins can be removed successfully.
"
"If your doctor is able to perform a complete resection, normal postoperative care will be required; no additional follow-up will be necessary. However, your doctor will want to monitor your dog's blood glucose postoperatively, particularly if your dog was hypoglycemic (low in blood sugar) prior to surgery.

"Apudoma is a gastrointestinal tumor found in dogs and cats which secretes peptide hormones -- hormones that play a role in regulating metabolism, growth, development, and tissue function. In the long run, the tumor(s) can cause ulcers, damage the esophagus because of chronic reflux, and damage the lining of the intestines.
"
"The cause of apudoma is currently not known.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to rule out the following diseases:
"
"The veterinarian will then run blood tests and chemistry analysis to identify if the animal has iron-deficiency anemia as a result of the gastrointestinal bleeding. Other concerns may include inadequate protein in the blood stream and an imbalance in electrolytes, due to the excessive vomiting.
"
"In addition, an ultrasound of the abdomen can be used to determine whether there is a tumor in the animal's pancreas, as well as an aspirate of any masses to test for mast cell disease. An endoscopy and biopsy of the upper digestive tract may also be recommended.
"
"  
"
"
"
"Unfortunately, most of the apudoma tumors are cancerous (malignant) and by the time they’re discovered, it’s too late to treat them. However, aggressive medical management can sometimes relieve the symptoms and give the animal additional months (or even years) to live. Exploring a pancreatic mass surgically is important for diagnosis, but also to establish a treatment regimen.
"
"Your pet will need frequent physical examinations, as well as careful observation at home. The veterinarian may also want to conduct X-rays and ultrasound exams from time to time to measure the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of the treatment. As there is no cure for the disease, the best you can hope for is to keep your pet comfortable and pain free for a few months, or even years.
"
"A dog's health is largely dependent on the body's ability to digest and make use of the food that is a part of the dog's regular diet. When the digestive process goes off track, a diseased condition will follow. Protein losing enteropathy is one type of condition that affects a dog's ability to function fully; enteropathy being any abnormal condition relating to the intestines. There are a number of diseases that can damage the intestines enough to cause this extra protein loss.
"
"Nutrients make their way through the body by way of the bloodstream. From the stomach, the food that has been eaten enters into the intestines, where it is divided into what is useful for the body and what is not. The useful, nutritious bits are picked up by the bloodstream as it passes through the intestines, carrying them to the rest of the body, where they are converted into various types of energy.
"
"As the bloodstream picks up these nutrients, a small amount of protein leaks from the blood vessels back into the intestines. Usually these proteins are digested in the intestines, absorbed back into the blood, and used by the body to make more protein, but when the intestines are damaged, more protein leaks out into the intestines than the body can replace.
"
"Although this condition can affect any breed or age of dog, some dog breeds are more likely than others to suffer from protein losing enteropathy, including the soft-coated wheaten terrier, basenji, Yorkshire terrier and Norwegian lundehund.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. A thorough physical examination will be performed, and will include standard laboratory work – a complete blood count, biochemical profile and urinalysis. Your veterinarian will use these samples to determine your dog's blood protein level and blood calcium level. There are several causes that will need to be ruled out in order to make a diagnosis. Your veterinarian will order stool (fecal) tests to check for intestinal parasites, intestinal infections, and other indicators that your dog is losing protein from its intestines.
"
"Your veterinarian may also check the blood vitamin levels, which will be low if your dog is losing protein from its intestines. X-ray and ultrasound images of your dog's chest and abdomen will allow your veterinarian to visually examine these internal structures for evidence of internal ulcerations or tumors, and will also display the heart's capabilities, and whether its performance appears to be abnormal. If your veterinarian needs a better visual of the stomach and intestines than external devices can provide, an endoscopy may be performed for a better view. In this test, a small camera, attached to a tube, will be passed through your dog's mouth or anus into the intestines so that the walls of the stomach and intestinal tract can be closely inspected for ulcers, tissue masses (tumors), or abnormalities in the wall or cell structure. The endoscopic device also allows for taking samples of tissue while it is inserted, and is a much less invasive method for performing a biopsy. Bioptic analysis is an especially useful diagnostic tool for determining why an animal is losing protein through its intestines.
"
"
"
"Treatment will depend on the underlying disease that is causing your dog to lose protein through its intestines. If your dog's protein level is dangerously low, it may need a transfusion to replace some of the blood protein.
"
"In most cases there is no cure for protein loss through the intestines. Your veterinarian will work with you to develop a treatment plan to help you manage your dog's symptoms, including exercise, and a diet that will ensure that the best possible amount of nutrients are being absorbed by your dog's body. During follow-up visits, complete blood counts and biochemical profiles will be done to make sure that your dog's blood protein level is stable and not becoming dangerously low. Your veterinarian will also check your dog to make sure it is not having trouble with breathing and does not have fluid built up in its belly.

"Ileus (functional or paralytic) is a term used to denote temporary and reversible obstruction in the intestines caused by bowel motility problems. Problems with peristalsis (or wave-like contractions that help move food along the digestive tract) results in the accumulation of intestinal contents in certain areas of the intestines. Therefore, ileus is not a primary disease, rather a result due to some other disease or condition affecting motility of intestine.
"
"After recording a detailed history and performing a complete physical examination, routine laboratory tests will be conducted. These tests include complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The main objective of the diagnostic effort is to find the underlying cause of this problem. Results of routine laboratory testing may reveal some information related to the underlying disease. Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound will help in finding various abnormalities including: presence of gas, fluid, mechanical obstruction (e.g., foreign body), tumor in abdomen, and other such conditions.
"
"For confirmation, your veterinarian may use more specific testing like Barium-Impregnated Polyethylene Spheres (BIPS). Barium is a chemical used in certain radiological studies to enhance visualization of anatomical structures. BIPS are markers given orally and will demonstrate the extent of intestinal obstruction and motility disorder. Your veterinarian will assess the time it takes for these markers to move along the intestines and how much delay is involved. This test also helps in the localization of the anatomical site involved.
"
"Endoscopy is also an option for diagnosis, especially for an assessment of mechanical obstruction. Your veterinarian will look directly into the stomach and intestine using an instrument called an endoscope. A rigid or flexible tube will be inserted into your dog’s stomach, where your veterinarian will be able to visually inspect and take pictures. In some cases, exploratory surgery may need to be performed to rule out mechanical obstruction. X-ray, computed tomography scan, magnetic imaging test, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid circulate around brain and spinal cord) may be required in animals with suspected spinal cord injury.
"
"
"
"As ileus is the result of some other underlying disease, treating the underlying cause is of utmost importance for resolution of this problem. For example, your veterinarian will use fluid therapy to address fluid and electrolyte derangements, which is common in dogs with ileus. In some dogs, drugs to enhance intestinal motility are also given to stimulate intestinal movements.  During treatment, your veterinarian will use a stethoscope to listen to the abdomen in order to find the status gut sounds and motility.
"
"If the primary underlying cause is identified and corrected, the prognosis is excellent in affected animals. But determining the exact underlying cause may be difficult in some animals. Follow directions given by your veterinarian regarding care and nutrition of your dog, and call your veterinarian immediately if you see any untoward symptom in your dog.
"
"In patients with a history of infections, regular temperature monitoring may be required at home. If medicines are prescribed for your dog, strictly follow the exact frequency and dosage of each drug. In addition, do not stop or alter treatment prior to consulting with your veterinarian.

"Interdigital cysts are not true cysts. They are inflamed and infected tissue in the webbing between a dog’s toes. Once inflamed, these lesions are called furuncles. Furuncles are more commonly found on the top of the front feet; however, all four feet can be affected. With little space between the toes to spread, the furuncle ruptures through the skin and produces a draining tract.
"
"Interdigital cysts or furuncles are painful and are the most common cause of draining tracts between the toes in dogs. Other causes of draining tracts are a reaction to a foreign object in the foot, infection of the hair follicle, or cancer.
"
"Any dog can develop interdigital cysts, but dogs that are short-haired, allergy-prone, overweight, or obese are more likely to develop them.
"
"Short bristly hairs in the webbing and increased webbing between the toes make these breeds more likely to get interdigital cysts:
"
"Shar-Pei
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"English Bulldog
"
"Mastiff
"
"Great Dane
"
"Boxer
"
"Basset Hound
"
"Symptoms of interdigital cysts on dogs include inflamed, reddened skin in the webbing between the toes that may have extended from the bottom to the top of the paw. The swellings are deep reddish-purple, shiny, and hairless and range in size from 1-2 centimeters. They are also movable, which is why they are misnamed as cysts. They can break through the skin and produce a bloody discharge.
"
"Interdigital cysts are painful, so dogs may limp, lick, and bite on the affected paw. There may be several nodules with new lesions developing as others resolve. 
"
"Interdigital cysts develop when hair follicles are traumatized, causing the microscopic opening of the hair follicle to enlarge. With limited space to expand, these follicles rupture and release their contents. The body sees this released material as foreign and creates an inflammatory reaction to it, as it does with bacteria, fungi, or mites.
"
"The initial trauma is usually related to excessive weight on the feet, conformational changes (presence of increased webbing or gait abnormalities), or foreign material embedded in the skin. The presence of foreign material in the skin prevents complete healing of the infection. Until it is removed, the cyst or furuncle will recur.
"
"The Demodex mite, a skin parasite, can cause interdigital cysts or furuncles as well as canine atopic dermatitis, an underlying skin condition. Until the mites are killed and the allergy causing atopic dermatitis is controlled, interdigital cysts will recur.
"
"The veterinarian diagnoses interdigital cysts or furuncles on your dog based on their history. First, they examine the dog’s paws looking for any discharge. To identify the cause of the initial trauma, the vet performs a combination of the following skin tests:
"
"Skin scraping or examining plucked hairs to rule out infection due to Demodex mites
"
"Impression smears, cytology, or culture to rule out other contaminants and determine the best antibiotic choice
"
"Skin biopsy to confirm changes to the hair follicle
"
"Bloodwork including hormone levels to rule out underlying disease
"
"Elimination diet trial to rule out food allergies
"
"Intradermal skin testing to rule out environmental allergens
"
"There are three major treatment options of interdigital cysts in dogs: medical therapy, surgery, and CO2 laser:
"
"Medical therapy: Medications include oral or topical anti-inflammatories, like steroids, and antibiotics. In severe cases, treatment is continued for four weeks after symptoms improve.
"
"Antibiotics alone may result in improvement, but without controlling the underlying cause of trauma the lesions tend to recur. Dogs often need systemic antibiotics of oral or long-lasting injectable medications for at least four weeks.
"
"Anti-inflammatories applied topically work best with only one lesion. Oral anti-inflammatories are needed for resistant cases or for dogs with multiple lesions.
"
"Surgery: Surgery removes the affected webbing and stitches the adjacent toes together, preventing the webbing from regrowing. This procedure changes the shape of the paw and can cause future orthopedic problems. Postoperative care is time-intensive and requires bandage changes 1-2 times daily. Foot licking and pain may still occur, so underlying conditions must be controlled.
"
"CO2 laser: Carbon dioxide lasers remove unhealthy, thin layers of skin with minimal damage to the surrounding area. Healthy skin can return without altering the shape of the paw. To achieve the best outcome, multiple laser procedures are needed.
"
"Despite treatment and identification of an underlying disease, some dogs have chronic recurrent lesions. These lesions are best controlled with long-term topical medications, like cyclosporine, and weekly or biweekly medicated baths.
"
"Successful recovery and management of interdigital cysts on dogs can take months to achieve. It is dependent on managing the cause of the underlying trauma, decreasing re-exposure to traumas, and rebuilding healthy skin. Factors like wet, hard, or uneven environments, dirty kennels, or uncontrolled allergies prevent complete resolution of interdigital cysts.
"
"Lifelong routine management is required to maintain remission. In most cases, medication to moderate the immune system’s response to environmental trauma is needed for long-term control.
"
"Yes. Lesions that recur despite therapy indicate your pet has an underlying disease (for example, canine atopic dermatitis, hypothyroidism, or another concurrent infection). Re-exposure to the trauma will also cause the interdigital cysts to recur.
"
"Trauma and environmental factors play a role in the development of interdigital cysts or furuncles in dogs. A clean and dry environment is best for dogs to sleep and play in. Dirty kennels and walking in large amounts of gravel, sand, pebbles, or glass increase the chance for trauma, infection, and interdigital cysts. Some dog breeds are also prone to developing interdigital cysts due to increased webbing between their toes, propensity for weight gain, and genetic conformation.
"
"Many natural products and techniques that claim to treat interdigital cysts are better at preventing interdigital cyst than treating them. Since the true underlying cause is trauma, prevention is aimed at limiting or removing the trauma and decreasing the risk of infection and inflammation. Topical therapy  such as bathing and overall good hygiene is a key part of initial therapy against active lesions, along with medical care and management of chronic, recurrent lesions. Products with chlorhexidine and miconazole are recommended. Paw butters are beneficial after a cyst has healed, to keep paw pads supple.
"
"Yes. Interdigital cysts are painful for dogs because they continue to rupture within the skin, producing more layers of cysts, a larger inflamed area, and increased pressure when walking.

"Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor originating in the glandular and epithelial tissue (the lining of the internal organs). This type of malignant tumor growth can take place in many parts of the body, including the gastrointestinal system of dogs. It may invade any part of the gastrointestinal system, including the stomach, the small and large intestine, and rectum. It commonly affects older dogs, usually more than six years of age. No particular breed is known to be predisposed and it is more common in male dogs than females. This type of cancer usually has a poor prognosis.
"
"Symptoms are most commonly related to the gastrointestinal system and include:
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog’s health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination on your dog, with blood tests, fecal tests and a biochemistry profile. The blood tests usually show mild to severe anemia, which is mainly due to gradual blood loss through the feces. Feces samples will also be observed under microscope to examine for the presence of hidden blood that is not visible grossly. Contrast radiography (using an injected contrast chemical agent to view the internal organs) may reveal the presence, location, and size of the neoplasm. Ultrasound is also a valuable tool in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Using ultrasound, your veterinarian may take a sample from the intestines or stomach, using a needle, to look for the presence of neoplastic cells in the sample fluid. An endoscope, a tubular diagnostic viewing tool that is inserted into the body, may also be used to collect a sample biopsy. If none of the above-mentioned procedures works well in confirming a diagnosis, your veterinarian may decide to perform surgery, which will ultimately establish the diagnosis.
"
"
"
"Surgery is the treatment of choice in adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal system, but a permanent cure is seldom achieved because metastasis (i.e., spreading) is common in affected patients. In cases of adenocarcinoma of the stomach, it is often difficult to remove all of the neoplastic tissue. In cases of neoplasm of intestines, the affected portion of the intestine is removed and the healthy portions of the intestine are sutured back together. Chemotherapy may be advised but it is usually unsuccessful. Painkillers are advised for lessening the pain associated with this neoplasm.
"
"If surgery is performed on your dog, you may need to revisit your attending veterinarian every three months after surgery for progress evaluations. At each visit, your veterinarian will perform a physical examination, including X-ray and ultrasound imaging to see if tumor is re-growing or not.
"
"These tumors typically grow rapidly, metastasizing to other parts and organs of the body. In cases of gastric adenocarcinoma, the survival time is usually two months, whereas in cases of intestinal neoplasm it is about ten months. But survival time is variable and can only be predicted by your veterinarian after complete evaluation of your dog.

"Insulinoma is a tumor of the pancreas that is most likely malignant and has already metastasized at time of diagnosis.
"
"The tumor is made up of cells that produce excessive insulin, which causes low blood sugar.
"
"When eating, the body releases insulin to break down sugar (glucose) in food. When the blood sugar decreases, the brain releases hormones that tell the pancreas to stop producing insulin.  However, the neoplastic cells (abnormal cells that make up the tumor) do not respond to the hormones and continue the production of insulin. The end result is very low blood sugar.
"
"The only consistent symptom of insulinoma in dogs is hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is when your dog’s blood sugar is too low, usually below 40. Normal blood sugar is between 80 and 120. 
"
"Clinical signs of low blood sugar:
"
"Very lethargic or low energy
"
"Wobbly
"
"Collapse
"
"Seizures
"
"Pale gums
"
"Nausea
"
"No underlying cause has been identified for insulinomas. It is found most often in large-breed middle-aged and older dogs. Young dogs are still able to develop insulinomas, but it is rare.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a full physical exam that will determine the clinical signs, but that’s not enough information for a definitive diagnosis.
"
"A blood diagnostic panel is then performed to evaluate the causes of the clinical signs; low blood sugar is the first key to a diagnosis. If the blood glucose is less than 60, the veterinarian will submit blood for insulin measurement. High insulin concentration with low blood sugar will confirm the diagnosis for insulinoma. Insulin to glucose ratio is another blood test that may be performed to confirm insulinoma. 
"
"Other diagnostics may include an ultrasound, which is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create a picture of organs, tissues, and other body structures. A CT may also be ordered, a diagnostic imaging test that uses a series of x-ray images taken at different angles of the body. Both are used to find the tumor. Even though a CT is more effective than ultrasound, both are helpful in analyzing the surrounding lymph nodes and liver for metastasis, when the tumor spreads to other parts of the body.
"
"Additionally, histopathology is an analysis of cells in tissues, and the only definitive way to diagnose. Cell samples from the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen are taken to assess for metastasis of the cancer. Radiographs of the chest and abdomen are also used to look for metastasis. An example would be finding lesions in the lungs.
"
"Malignancy is when cancer cells have already migrated to other areas of the body. It is common with insulinoma in dogs. More than half of dog patients have malignancy by the time of their diagnosis. 
"
"Stage I: Stage I insulinoma is confined to the pancreas. Cancer has not been detected in other organs or lymph nodes.
"
"Stage II: Stage II insulinoma has some infiltration of cancer cells in the surrounding tissues. This is usually found in a lymph node of that region.
"
"Stage III: Stage III insulinoma has spread to surrounding organs and lymph nodes.
"
"Surgical removal of the tumor is the treatment of choice, as it removes the cells causing the clinical symptoms and provides a better survival outcome. Surgery is recommended even for dogs with Stage III to provide a better quality of life.
"
"The survival rate is highly affected by the degree or stage of metastasis that has occurred at the time of diagnosis and what treatment is being provided. Surgical treatment with supplemental medical treatment provides the longest survival time. This can be up to 1.5 years in Stage I and Stage II. Survival time of about 6 months is usually seen in Stage III.
"
"Medical management is not a cure, but it is used to make the dog comfortable and happy. The goal of medical management is to maintain normal blood glucose and slow the growth of the tumor. It entails medication, supplements, and diet. 
"
"Medications that help increase blood glucose or decrease insulin are used to help maintain a healthy blood glucose level. Prednisone is commonly used to reduce the release of insulin while stimulating glucose production in the liver. Diazoxide and octreotide medications are also available to help maintain a good blood glucose level. 
"
"Supplements may be used when hypoglycemia is suspected. Nutri-Cal is a common supplement often recommended to dogs with insulinoma. Karo syrup is another supplement to have on hand for dogs that need insulin or glucose management. Both are good at giving a spike in blood glucose levels during a hypoglycemic crisis. These supplements may also be recommended to help prevent hypoglycemia by giving small amounts a few times a day.
"
"Diet is critical in medical treatment. Feeding multiple small meals during the day decreases the spike in glucose intake, which is what stimulates insulin production. Decreasing the severity of spikes in glucose will decrease the release of insulin.
"
"Foods that are prescribed for dogs with diabetes have complex carbohydrates less likely to cause a large spike in glucose after eating. Recommendations for prescription diet foods include:
"
"Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Diets EN Gastroenteric Fiber Balance
"
"Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Adult Glycobalance  
"
"Sadly, insulinomas are highly malignant and are not completely curable. Removal of the tumor with medical management will provide the most qualitative and quantitative results. Medical management needs to be continued for life after surgical removal of the tumor.
"
"If surgery is not an option, the next goal is to provide the best quality of life for your pet. Diet changes with medications can help maintain a good blood glucose level, decreasing clinical symptoms. Life expectancy may be shortened but you can still provide a good quality of life.
"
"Yes, hypoglycemia can be due to several other diseases. These diseases include but not limited to hypoadrenocorticism, other cancers of the pancreas, some liver diseases, and severe infection. Hypoglycemia can also be result of lack of nutrition especially in small breeds.

"Cutaneous vasculitis is inflammation of the blood vessels due to a proliferation of neutrophils, lymphocytes, or, rarely, with eosinophil deposition. Neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils are types of white blood cells that are important components of the immune system.
"
"Phlebitis is characterized by a condition known as superficial thrombophlebitis, which refers to an inflammation of superficial veins (or veins close to the surface of the body). Phlebitis is generally due to an infection or because of thrombosis -- the formation of a clot (or thrombus) inside a blood vessel, which in turn obstructs the flow of blood in the body.
"
"Superficial venous thrombophlebitis is the most common form of this condition, and is usually localized in one area.
"
"Conversely, deep tissue thrombophlebitis is associated with clinical signs of sepsis, in which a bacterial infection occurs due to the presence of pathogenic organisms and their toxins in the blood or tissues. This type of thrombophlebitis is also associated with deep tissue thromboembolism, in which a clot or thrombus formed in one part of the body breaks free and migrates to another blood vessel, where it causes blockage.
"
"Phlebitis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"The main symptom of phlebitis is a localized inflammation, which is characterized by warmth, swelling, pain, hardened vessels, or a redness of the skin known as erythema. If at least two of the aforementioned signs are present, this can be taken as a sign of local inflammation. Drainage or fever may also be present, both being associated with the body's response to such infections.
"
"There is no specific age, breed, or gender of dog that is known to be more susceptible to the development of phlebitis. However, very young or elderly dogs may be at higher risk simply due to a less developed or poorly functioning immune system.
"
"Other characteristics that are considered risk factors for the development of phlebitis include obesity, lack of mobility, poor vein quality, chronic heart or kidney disease, pregnancy, and/or an immunodeficiency disorder in which the dog's immune system does not function properly.
"
"The main cause of phlebitis is intravenous (IV) catheter use. Poor catheter quality or care may lead to bacterial colonization of a catheter, which can then infect the dog. Catheters are often used during surgery, or in emergency situations for treating trauma victims.
"
"A number of diagnostic procedures are necessary for properly diagnosing phlebitis. The Doppler test is an inexpensive means for testing blood flow in the dog's veins, and may reveal any blood circulation irregularities and blockage. Blood cultures may also indicate signs associated with systematic inflammations. Additional diagnostic techniques may include x-ray imaging and urine analysis.
"
"Dog of any age, gender, and breed may be affected. However, dachshunds, collies, Shetland sheepdogs, German shepherds, and rottweilers are at high risk.
"
"Your veterinarian will begin by taking the normal fluid samples, followed by samples of the affected tissue for analysis. The results of the laboratory tests, including the complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis, are usually found to be within normal ranges. Your veterinarian may order more specific tests to rule out any other diseases that are known to cause similar symptoms.
"
"Sample from the upper layers of the skin will need to be taken for laboratory analysis, and your doctor may need to enlist the assistance of a veterinary pathologist to determine if there are true abnormalities. The veterinary pathologist may need to examine several layers of skin to determine the nature and types of changes, such as whether deposition of single or mixed type of white blood cells (WBCs) -- neutrophils, lymphocytes, or eiosinophils -- are gathering in and around the blood vessels.
"
"The pathologist may also observe necrotized (dead) blood vessels, hemorrhages, or edema within the skin layers. In cases with systemic infections underlying this disorder, further laboratory testing may be ordered to isolate the causative infectious organism.
"
"
"
"Treating the underlying disease is of prime importance in resolving the symptoms. Antibiotics will be administered if infection is present, and intravenous fluids will be given if your dog is dehydrated. In cases of immune-mediated diseases (in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues), drugs for suppressing the abnormal immune system response will be given.
"
"If your dogs need to be treated with drugs to suppress the immune system, you will need to monitor the dog closely for any irregularities, change in health status, or new instances of illness. These types of drugs have the potential for serious side-effects, since the immune system is more vulnerable as a result of the immune suppression. You will need to do as much as possible to protect tour dog from any new infections, and provide for him a healthy diet and a stress-free living environment.
"
"Follow-up examinations will be conducted around every two weeks to monitor the progress of therapy and make adjustments as needed. Routine laboratory testing and monitoring the level of immune system suppression is also required for these patients. The doses of drugs being used to suppress the immune system will be reduced if there is too much suppression and the dog is suffering as a result.
"
"The overall prognosis largely depends on the successful treatment of the underlying disease. If the underlying disease cannot be diagnosed and treated, the prognosis is generally not good.

"If infection is suspected, antibiotic treatment will be the most likely treatment. The specific antibiotic prescribed to your dog will depend on the location of the infection, as well as the suspected contaminants behind the infection (if no culture is available at the time). Additional medications may help to make your dog more comfortable by alleviating related symptoms.
"
"After the initial treatment, antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on the follow-up culture tests. Certain veins, known as phlebotic veins, should be avoided for IV therapy or blood collection until your dog has completely recovered. With proper antibiotic treatment, the most severe cases may still take up to three weeks to resolve.
"
"Because the main cause of phlebitis is poor quality catheters or improper catheter care, this is the primary area to target when thinking about prevention. Any IV catheter sites should be cleaned regularly with antimicrobials and treated with antimicrobial ointment, in order to avoid bacterial infection that may lead to phlebitis. Sterile dressings should be used, and catheters should be changed within 24 hours, especially if they were placed in an emergency situation. Longer catheters may reduce the incidence of phlebitis.

"Lymphocytic-plasmacytic gastroenteritis is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which lymphocytes and plasma cells enter the lining of the stomach and intestines. It is thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response to environmental stimuli due to loss of normal immune regulation, in which bacteria in the intestine may be a trigger. Continued antigen exposure, along with unregulated inflammation, results in disease, although the exact mechanisms and underlying factors remain unknown.
"
"Lymphocyic-plasmacytic gastroenteritis is the most common form of IBD affecting dogs (and cats). Basenjis, Lundenhunds, and Soft-coated Wheaton Terriers have particular familial forms of IBD.
"
"Signs vary dramatically from patient to patient depending on disease severity and the organ affected. Symptoms to look for include:
"
"Your veterinarian will do a complete physical exam and take a thorough history from you. A chemical blood profile, urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel will be ordered. Depending on their results, he or she may run intestinal tests or take blood to check the function of your dog’s thyroid and pancreas.
"
"An endoscopy may be performed, which is very useful for the veterinarian to get a clearer look at the condition of the stomach and intestines, and to take samples for testing. In addition, a fecal sample will be taken for microscopic analysis to check for parasites.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will keep your dog in the hospital if it is severely dehydrated due to chronic vomiting and diarrhea. There, your pet will be given fluids intravenously. (It should not be fed by mouth while it is still vomiting.) If your pet is severely underweight, your veterinarian may insert a stomach tube to feed your pet.
"
"Depending on the underlying cause, he or she will change your pet’s diet, which is called elimination diets. Medication is also available depending on the underlying cause of the disease.
"
"You will be advised to bring the dog back for a follow-up appointment. If the animal is still very ill or on strong medication, less time will pass between check-ups. As your pet stabilizes, your veterinarian will want to examine your pet less often.
"
"You will also work with the veterinarian to formulate a new diet and assess the results on a continual basis until there are no more signs of illness.

"Dermatomyositis is an inherited inflammatory disease of the skin, muscles, and blood vessels. It typically develops in young collies, Shetland sheepdogs, and their crossbreeds. Similar symptoms have been reported in other breeds, such as the Beauceron Shepherd, Welsh Corgi, Lakeland terrier, Chow Chow, German Shepherd, and Kuvasz, as well as individual dogs. However, the condition in these dogs currently is classified as ischemic dermatopathy (low blood supply to the skin) and not dermatomyositis as previously reported. Studies suggest that dermatomyositis is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (the chromosome is inherited from both parents), with variable expression. Skin lesions typically develop before six months of age, and may develop as early as seven weeks. The full extent of lesions usually is present by one year of age, with lessening afflictions thereafter. Adult-onset dermatomyositis can occur, but it is rare.
"
"Signs of dermatomyositis can vary from subtle skin lesions and inflammation of muscles, to severe skin lesions and a generalized decrease in muscle mass (known as muscle atrophy), with an enlarged esophagus (the tube running from the throat to the stomach). Skin lesions around the eyes, lips, face, and inner surface of the prick ears will vary in intensity; the entire face may be involved. The tip of the tail and bony prominences can also be affected.
"
"Lesions may increase and decrease over time. They are characterized by variable degrees of crusted areas, with loss of the top surface of the skin (they are referred to as erosions or ulcers, based on the depth of tissue loss) and alopecia. Reddening of the skin (erythema), and accumulations of surface skin cells, such as seen in dandruff, or scaling skin, may be manifestations of this disease. The initial skin lesions may leave scars on the skin. More severely affected dogs may have difficulty eating, drinking, and swallowing.
"
"Symptoms of  dermatomyositis are usually seen in affected dogs before they are six months of age. Several litter-mates may be affected, but the severity of the disease often varies significantly among dogs that are affected by this disease. Foot-pad ulcers and ulcers in the mouth as well as nail abnormalities or loss may occur, along with inflammation of the muscles. Signs may be absent, or they may vary from a subtle decrease in the mass of the muscles extending from the top and side of the head, behind the eye, to the lower jaw, or they may be too generalized, with loss of muscle mass at equal points of the body. A stiff gait may also be present. There will often be a decrease in muscle mass of the muscles extending from the bone below the eye to the lower jaw muscle that acts to close the jaw, and in the muscles extending from the top and side of the head and behind the eye, to the lower jaw muscles that act to close the jaw. Dogs that have been diagnosed with an enlarged esophagus may come down with pneumonia. Conditions that can lead to pneumonia will need to be avoided.
"
"Causes for dermatomyositis can usually be traced to a hereditary source, but can also be sourced to an immune-mediated disease, or to infectious agents.
"
"
"
"Most dogs can be treated as outpatients, but dogs with severe inflammation of the muscles, and an enlarged esophagus, may need to be hospitalized for supportive care. If the condition is so severe that treatment will be ineffectual, euthanasia may be indicated and recommended by your veterinarian.
"
"To protect your pet’s skin from further irritation or damage you will need to avoid activities that may traumatize the skin. Keep your pet indoors during the day to avoid exposure to intense sunlight, since ultraviolet-light exposure may worsen skin lesions. You may need to change your pet’s diet if it has an enlarged esophagus, or has difficulty eating and/or swallowing.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend hypoallergenic shampoos and treatment for secondary bacterial skin infections. Vitamin E, essential fatty-acid supplements, steroids to decrease inflammation, and a medication to improve blood flow may also be prescribed. Infected animals should not be bred out, and it is strongly recommended that intact animals be neutered.

"Systemic vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels that is usually the result of an injury to the endothelial cell layer, which covers the internal surfaces of heart, the lymph vessels, and the interior surface of the blood vessels. It can also be caused by infection or inflammation that has reached the endothelial cell layer from other parts of the body. For example, bacteria, viruses, toxins, parasites, or by-products of the immune system can accumulate at the endothelial layer and can lead to an inflammation response in multiple sites of the body
"
"Symptoms may vary depending on which of the various organs are involved -- such as the liver, kidneys or brain.
"
"Systemic vasculitis may be directly related to infections, including bacterial, viral, or parasitic. Some dogs may develop the disorder due to an immune-mediated disease, where the immune system over reacts and attacks its own body system. Other underlying causes for systemic vasculitis include:
"
"Your doctor will begin with the standard fluid analyses, including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolytes, and urinalysis. Any abnormalities that show up in the results of the laboratory tests will depend on the underlying disease or disorder. Your veterinarian may need to conduct various tests to conclusively diagnose the primary disease responsible for the symptoms.
"
"Because this is a disorder of the internal organs, internal visual diagnostics will need to be used to judge the severity of the disorder and to determine a course of action. X-rays will be conducted to diagnose whether heartworm disease is the culprit, and your veterinarian may also take samples of skin tissue in order to diagnose inflammation of blood vessels, and what is present in the tissue to be causing the inflammatory response.
"
"If food or drug allergy is suspected, the first recommendation is usually to discontinue the use of the suspected food or drug and to judge the response. If this is the case, your veterinarian will advise on the appropriate diet to change to for your dog while determining the cause. It is not advisable to make dramatic diet changes without the guidance of a health professional.
"
"
"
"The primary goal of therapy is to treat the underlying condition responsible for the inflammation of the blood vessels. In cases of underlying immune-mediated disorder, your veterinarian will prescribe drugs for the suppression of the abnormal immune system response.
"
"You may need to revisit your veterinarian at regular intervals for an evaluation of your dog's response to treatment and so that adjustments can be made as needed. Your veterinarian will probably need to run regular blood tests, especially early on in treatment. It is also critical to administer all of the prescribed drugs, at their prescribed doses and times, for the entirety of the time your doctor has ordered. Even a single missed dose can compromise the progress of the therapy.
"
"While under medical care, your dog will need to be fed a diet based on optimum, well-balanced nutrition. The type of food that is appropriate during this time may be dependent on your dog's age, breed, and overall health status. Make sure to consult with your veterinarian if you have any questions, and stay to the treatment and diet guidelines as closely as possible.
"
"If your dogs need to be treated with drugs to suppress the immune system, you will need to monitor the dog closely for any irregularities, change in health status, or new instances of illness. These types of drugs have the potential for serious side-effects, since the immune system is more vulnerable as a result of the immune suppression.

"Bile is a bitter fluid secreted by the liver and released into the gallbladder, to be stored until is is released into the duodenum -- the small intestine -- after a meal is taken. Bile is an essential component in digestion, emulsifying the fats in food, thereby aiding in their absorption in the small intestine.
"
"Under abnormal circumstances, however, bile can be released into the abdominal cavity, irritating the organ and causing inflammation. This may occur after injury, infection of the gallbladder, swelling of the gallbladder, blockage of the gallbladder’s ducts, or bile leakage.
"
"Bile peritonitis is usually the result of a more serious underlying condition. In fact, when caused by an infection, bile peritonitis kills as many as 75 percent of those animals infected with the disease.
"
"Signs can be acute or chronic. However, symptoms for infectious bile peritonitis are generally acute, while those for non-infectious bile peritonitis are long-term. Such symptoms include:
"
"Bile peritonitis is generally caused by inflammation of the gallbladder or an injury that causes the dog's gallbladder to rupture or break. Moreover, inflammation of the gallbladder may be due to infection or a blockage of the gallbladder ducts, which can be caused by:
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted as part of a standard exam, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.
"
"If your dog is suffering from bile peritonitis, high liver enzymes will be present in the blood chemical profile and bile will be present in the urine. Abdominal x-rays and  ultrasound will enable your veterinarian to visualize the liver and gallbladder area in the course of determining the origin of the bile leakage. Using an ultrasound to guide the process, your veterinarian may take a sample of your dog's liver for biopsy, along with abdominal fluid that is present in the abdominal cavity. These samples will be sent to the laboratory for analysis.
"
"
"
"Treatment will depend on what is causing the bile to escape from your dog's gallbladder into its abdomen. Fluid therapy is standard for preventing dehydration, and antibiotics will be prescribed to prevent infection. Other drugs and the need for surgery will be entirely dependent on the cause of the leakage. However, the cause for bile peritonitis is often of a serious nature, and can be life threatening if not treated early and effectively.
"
"Recovery is slow and regular follow-up appointments to your veterinarian are essential for following the progress and adjusting the drugs or treatment techniques as necessary. Bloodwork and samples of abdominal fluid will be taken at each visit. This will allow your veterinarian to see if the infection and/or bile leakage are still occurring. X-rays and ultrasounds may also be repeated at each appointment.

"Gastrointestinal reflux, or acid reflux, is one of the most common causes of esophagitis, the term applied to inflammation of the esophagus in dogs. Acid reflux is the result of stomach acids passing into the esophageal canal, causing irritation to the tissue lining of the esophagus, the muscular tube that carries food down from the mouth cavity to the stomach.
"
"Young dogs born with congenital esophageal abnormalities are at an increased risk for esophagitis. Older dogs that are being treated with anesthesia for surgery, or for other reasons, may also develop this condition. One of the most important complications of esophagitis is aspiration pneumonia, which occurs due to the entrance of food particles or liquid drops into lungs.
"
"Your veterinarian will examine your dog thoroughly after taking a full history from you. You will need to give your veterinarian as much information as you can about your dog's health, including the onset of symptoms, and any possible incidents that might have preceded this condition.
"
"Routine laboratory testing will include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and a urinalysis, though these tests usually return as normal in such patients. However, in cases of pneumonia, changes related to the infection may be seen in laboratory results. Radiographic studies, including X-ray or ultrasound imaging, may help in the diagnosis of esophagitis. An advanced type of radiography called barium contrast radiography may reveal changes in the esophagus due to inflammation. In barium contrast radiography, barium sulfate is administered orally to the dog. The particles are suspended in the esophagus, making the esophageal canal easier to visualize on X-ray.
"
"Endoscopy is also an option for diagnosis in these patients and is often a more reliable procedure for diagnosis of esophagitis. Endoscopy is an internal diagnostic tool which uses an endoscope, a rigid but flexible tube equipped with a camera and methods for retrieving tissue samples, that can be inserted into a hollow cavity, such as the esophagus. Using this method, your veterinarian can look directly into the esophagus in order to visually inspect it, to take pictures, and to take a sample for biopsy.
"
"Endoscopy may also be used to remove a foreign body, if required.

"If gastrointestinal reflux is the cause of the esophagitis, your veterinarian will treat the cause and the symptoms to reduce their amount and frequency, and also to prevent the esophagus from narrowing in response to the stress and trauma.
"
"If your dog is found to have a case of mild esophagitis it may be treated as an outpatient and will not likely need to be admitted into hospital. However, if your dog is suffering from complications like pneumonia, it will need to be admitted into hospital for intensive care and treatment. Fluids will be required for patients suffering from dehydration, and oxygen will be supplemented until your dog's breathing has improved and it is out of danger. Antibiotics are often required to treat pneumonia in affected patients, but this is not always the case.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend withholding water and food for a few days. While your dog is recovering, there are various methods for giving nutrition, including intravenous nutrition.
"
"When your dog is able to ingest food again, a soft, palatable and highly nutritious food is recommended. Follow up progress checkups are an important part of after care, and endoscopy examinations are usually performed to verify that the esophagus is healing properly. The prognosis for affected animals is good if the esophagitis is recognized and treated promptly and aggressively. However, if the condition has progressed to the point that the esophagus has formed a stricture (narrowing), the prognosis is usually very poor.

"Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a potentially life-threatening disease  of the heart that causes arrhythmia, an abnormally fast heartbeat. Ventricular tachycardia can degenerate into  ventricular fibrillation, a condition in which the ventricles (the  bottom two heart chambers) become disorganized, contracting chaotically.  This state can result in asystole – a sudden lack of electrical  activity in the heart – and sudden death. VT  may be due to an underlying heart disease, a metabolic disease, or an  electrolyte imbalance.
"
"The heart is divided into four chambers: the two top chambers are called the atria (singular: atrium) and the bottom chambers are called the ventricles. The heart has an electrical conduction system that is responsible for controlling the heart rate. This electrical conduction system generates electrical impulses (waves), which propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body. Ventricular tachycardia is related to abnormal behavior in the ventricles.
"
"Ventricular tachycardia  may occur in structurally normal hearts, as hereditary arrhythmias, or may be a consequence of myocardial abnormalities associated with cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), significant valvular disease, or myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation). To date, there is no medical therapy available that is known to prevent sudden death in dogs afflicted with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
"
"If your dog is unstable, your doctor will apply treatment based on the symptoms before diagnosing the cause of the ventricular tachycardia.  (See the treatment section below.)  If your dog is stable, your veterinarian will begin with a complete physical exam of your dog. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The electrolyte panel will show if there is hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. The bloodwork may show evidence of pancreatitis and hyperthyroidism.
"
"An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat), and an echocardiogram (ultrasound imaging for the heart) will be performed to check for structural heart disease. A long-term ambulatory (portable) electrocardiograph recording of the heart's electrical activity, using a Holter monitor, can be used for detecting temporary ventricular arrhythmias in patients with unexplained syncope or weakness. The Holter can be especially useful for animals, since it can be worn as a vest, allowing your dog freedom of normal movement, which, when taken into account with a diary kept (by the pet caretaker) while the monitor is being worn, can give your veterinarian a reference frame for when the heartbeat irregularities are most likely to occur.
"
"
"
"If your dog is stable, electrolyte abnormalities will be corrected using fluid administration. Echocardiogram and use a 24-Holter to establish a true baseline of the arrhythmia quantity and quality.
"
"If your dog is unstable (inactive and lying down, weak, or frequent fainting), immediate intravenous treatment in a hospital setting with continuous ECG monitoring may be required. Once the arrhythmia is controlled and your dog's blood pressure has stabilized, oral medication should be started. The medication will be based on your dog's overall health, and how well your dog is able to tolerate the episodes of VT and how frequently they occur. Medications may be given to suppress future episodes, and your dog's activity level will probably need to be minimized. A follow-up 24-hour Holter will be required to test the efficacy of the anti-arrhythmic medication.
"
"Unfortunately, dogs with ventricular tachycardia will sometimes die suddenly. Exciting situations (i.e., those that cause the heart to speed up) will need to be avoided in order to avoid provoking a ventricular tachycardia episode. This appears to be especially true in regards to the Boxer breed. Your veterinarian will schedule subsequent follow-up appointments with you for your dog as necessary.

"Urinary retention is the medical term given to incomplete emptying (or voiding) of urine that is not associated with obstruction of the urinary tract, whereas ""functional"" is defined as being caused by a problem with the normal action of an organ.
"
"Complications resulting from functional urinary retention may come from a lower urinary tract infection that ascends into the bladder; rupture of the urinary bladder or urethra; and permanent injury and atony (weakness/loss of coordination) to the detrusor muscle, the muscular layer of the urinary bladder wall, which contracts, pushes down on the contents of the bladder, and causes the urine to leave the body through the urethra.
"
"This condition is more common in male than in female dogs.
"
"Hypercontractility of the Urinary Bladder Detrusor Muscle (Detrusor Atony)
"
"Functional Urinary Obstruction
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The urinalysis may reveal evidence of urinary tract infection or inflammation.
"
"A neurologic examination will include a brief assessment of the lower, caudal spine. Peripheral nerve function will be apparent from the examination of anal tone, tail tone, and perineal reflexes (the muscle between the anal and urethral openings). Urethral catheterization may be required to rule out urethral obstruction. If there is no obstruction the catheter should pass easily through the urethra.
"
"Myelography, epidurography, or computed tomography (CT scans) can be used to determine if lesions are present on the spine, indicating a neurological cause. Another imaging technique veterinarians use involves injecting a radiocontrasting agent into the dog's body to follow the course of the urine from the kidneys through the urethral tract by X-ray.
"
"Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis to settle on the underlying cause. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.
"
"Dysmetria and hypermetria are outward symptoms of a dysfunction of the pathways that control voluntary movement in a dog. More specifically, dysmetria is characterized by the dog's inability to judge the rate, range, and force of its movements -- literally, an inability to measure space. Hypermetria, meanwhile, describes the action of overreaching, or high stepping, the intended location.
"
"Signs of cerebellar disease that may be present include:
"
"Trauma to the brain or back is often the primary cause for spinal or brain injury, leading to lack of coordination or overreaching of the  limbs. Lesions on the cerebellum, the part of the brain that is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements and balance, or on the nerves leading to the cerebellum, are believed to be one of the causes for these symptoms. Lesions can be caused by strokes, or by tumors located near these nerves.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. If there are no other signs of cerebellar disease, it will be important to establish whether a high-stepping thoracic limb gait is normal for your dog. Some dogs, especially small breeds, have a normally occurring high-stepping gait in their front limbs, so your veterinarian will want to differentiate what is normal as opposed to what might be an underlying cause for the odd movements. If there are no other signs of cerebellar disease, it is important to establish from the owner whether a high-stepping thoracic limb gait is normal for his or her dog. Diagnostic imaging, such as with X-ray or ultrasound, is generally performed to review possible injury or damage to the brain and spine, and is especially recommended for older animals.
"
"Your veterinarian will check your dog's reactions and responses to stimulus. One test that is standard is checking the dog's menace response, or menace reflex, an involuntary eye response that occurs when a finger is stabbed toward the the eyes. If the dog does not reflexively close its eyes and jerk away when your veterinarian does this, your doctor can assume that there is a of loss of eye sight, or neurological dysfunction.
"
"
"
"If the condition is severe and/or rapidly progressive, hospitalization is recommended for an immediate diagnostic work-up and treatment. If the condition is mild or slowly progressive, treatment is often done on an outpatient basis. Generally, dogs that are suffering from this condition are confined to ensure that they are not at risk of being injured while they are healing. You will need to set up a place in the house where your dog can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Trips outdoors for bladder and bowel relief should be kept short and easy for your dog to handle during the recovery period. You may consider cage rest for a short time, if it is difficult to keep your dog confined to one place.
"
"However, it is important that your dog is not left alone for extended times, as this can be a very stressful time for the dog. Your dog's healing process will benefit from being comforted by you.
"
"It is recommended that periodic neurologic examinations be performed to monitor your dog's progress.

"Here are some of the possible causes that will be considered and either discounted or confirmed:
"
"
"
"Unless there is a severe underlying condition that is causing this urinary disorder, your dog will likely be treated on an inpatients basis until adequate urinary function returns. Urinary tract infection, if present, will be identified specifically and treat appropriately. Your veterinarian will address primary disorders such as electrolyte disturbances and neurologic lesions and correct them if possible. Azotemia, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances associated with acute urine retention will be managed appropriately. Your doctor will also manage excess levels of urea and other nitrogenous waste products in the blood (uremia or azotemia), electrolyte imbalances, and acid–base disturbances associated with sudden (acute) urine retention
"
"In some cases, complete voiding function does not return, in which case lifetime management of your dog's urinary health will be required on your part. Frequent manual compression will be needed for release of urine, and intermittent or indwelling urinary catheterization may be required to ensure urine flow and to keep the urinary bladder small.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform periodic urinalysis to detect urinary tract infection if your dog has been diagnosed with chronic urine retention.

"Immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMPA) is a term that encompasses multiple conditions leading to joint inflammation (arthritis) in dogs due to molecules being deposited in the joints by the immune system.
"
"Normally, the immune system combats external threats like viruses and bacteria by binding and disarming them with protective antibodies, forming molecules called immune complexes. In most cases of IMPA in dogs, immune complexes accumulate abnormally in the joint fluid, attracting cells that fight infection to the wrong places and causing damage to the smooth cartilage that covers the bones of the joint.
"
"Most cases of IMPA in dogs are considered idiopathic, meaning that an obvious cause of the immune reaction cannot be found. This is known as primary IMPA.
"
"Immune complexes in IMPA can also be created because of infection, inflammation, or cancer in other parts of the body, and this is termed secondary IMPA. It’s important to differentiate the two, if possible, because managing the cause in secondary IMPA is crucial for getting your dog to feel better.
"
"While IMPA is considered a rare disease in dogs, the clinical signs can closely resemble other conditions—suggesting that it might be underdiagnosed and potentially more common than we think.
"
"IMPA in dogs can be a very painful and debilitating condition, and clinical signs should be evaluated promptly—ideally within days of onset.
"
"Dogs struggling to rise because of extreme pain, exhibiting fever, or showing no interest in food may benefit from emergency care.
"
"Signs of immune-mediated polyarthritis in dogs may include:
"
"Lameness or limping
"
"Joint swelling and pain (usually affecting multiple joints)
"
"Fever
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Lethargy
"
"Most cases of primary IMPA in dogs are considered idiopathic, with no identified cause of the excessive immune response.
"
"Certain breeds—including Shar-Pei, Akitas, Duck Tolling Retrievers, and Greyhounds—show possible genetic predispositions, although any breed can be affected.
"
"Several potential causes exist for secondary IMPA in dogs, as any overreaction of a dog’s immune system can lead to deposition of immune complexes in the joints.
"
"Inflammation or infection of the nervous system, heart, liver, and GI tract have all been implicated as potential causes. Tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease may also predispose dogs to IMPA. Rarer causes include drug reactions and cancerous tumors.
"
"Diagnosing IMPA in dogs requires testing to rule out other diseases with similar symptoms.
"
"Your vet will start with a thorough physical exam of your pup to pinpoint areas of pain and inflammation. Suspicion for the disease will be higher in cases where pain is relatively sudden and affecting multiple joints, especially in predisposed breeds.
"
"Tests may include a complete blood count, blood chemistry, urinalysis, tick-borne disease testing, and radiographs of the chest and abdomen. These tests will help your vet rule out other causes of joint pain and look for disease processes that may be leading to secondary IMPA.
"
"If abdominal radiographs are inconclusive, an abdominal ultrasound may be recommended. Radiographs of the joints themselves can help rule out fractures, ligament injuries, and bone cancer.
"
"To rule out joint infection before treating for IMPA in dogs, an evaluation of the joint fluid is needed. Sampling of this fluid, called arthrocentesis, is uncomfortable and requires anesthesia and sterile preparation of the joint to avoid contamination. Analysis of inflammatory cell ratios and protein levels in the joint can provide indications of IMPA.
"
"IMPA in dogs is treatable, with the prognosis depending heavily on the type of IMPA suspected and whether it is primary or secondary. If pain and inflammation can be quickly controlled before significant joint damage occurs, your dog can live a long and happy life.
"
"Primary IMPA is treated with medications that suppress the immune system (such as steroids or cyclosporine) to halt the deposit of immune complexes. In cases of severe joint damage, pain medications and joint support medications may also be needed. Some dogs can be weaned off of medications after six to eight months, while others may require lifelong therapy.
"
"For secondary IMPA, the underlying cause of the immune reaction must be identified and treated or the immune reaction is likely to recur. In some cases, controlling the underlying condition is all that’s needed, while others may still require some level of suppression of the immune system. The many possible causes for the same clinical signs make IMPA one of the more challenging autoimmune syndromes to manage.
"
"Once immune system suppression has been initiated and the underlying causes of IMPA have been controlled or cured, clinical recovery is often quick, with dogs feeling much better within days to weeks.
"
"In most cases, after your dog has been symptom-free for at least two to four weeks, your vet will try to decrease the doses of the immunosuppressive medications.
"
"This weaning process can take many months, especially if multiple medications were needed to control your dog’s symptoms. Some dogs may exhibit clinical signs at lower medication doses and need to stay on higher doses long-term.
"
"Severe cases of IMPA in dogsmay result in long-term joint damage, requiring additional comfort management, because joint cartilage currently can’t be regrown.
"
"Maintaining your dog at a healthy weight is crucial to reducing stress on damaged joints. Low-impact activities like swimming can keep joints moving and healthy without causing further injury.
"
"Talk to your vet about rehabilitation, massage, and laser therapy for pain control. Joint supplements like Movoflex®, Dasuquin®, omega-3 fatty acids like Welactin®, and Adequan® are generally safe to be given alongside medications that treat Immune-mediated polyarthritis in dogs.
"
"Primary IMPA in dogs can be very difficult to predict and prevent.
"
"You can minimize inflammatory conditions by keeping up to date on your dog vaccinations and parasite prevention products.
"
"Regular annual exams and screening blood work can also assist you and your vet in identifying potential systemic disease early, which can help prevent the onset of an overactive immune system.
"
"Stage four arthritis—characterized by severe joint damage—can significantly impact your dog’s quality of life, leading some pet parents to consider humane euthanasia.
"
"The lifespan with this disease depends heavily on your ability to control your dog’s pain. Pain management often involves a combination of medications. Talk to your vet to explore medication and other pain-control options.
"
"There is evidence to suggest that certain genes make some dogs more likely to have the excessive immune response leading to IMPA.

"Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) in dogs is a blood disease in which the dog’s immune system attacks and destroys the body’s platelets. ITP is a serious disease and is common in middle-aged dogs.
"
"ITP can be classified as either a primary or secondary disease. In primary, or idiopathic, ITP, there’s no known reason why the immune system is destroying the body’s platelets. In secondary ITP, the immune system destroys platelets in response to an underlying condition, such as cancer, infection, or toxin or drug exposure.
"
"Due to the severity of ITP’s effects, the disease is a medical emergency and should be treated by your dog’s veterinarian or the nearest veterinary emergency hospital as soon as possible.
"
"Platelets are a type of blood cell that play an important role in blood clotting. Platelets are produced in the bone marrow and released into the bloodstream.
"
"Dogs normally have between 200,000 and 500,000 platelets per microliter of blood, but only 20,000 to 50,000 per microliter are needed to prevent spontaneous bleeding and bruising. 
"
"Platelets are stored in the spleen and travel through the bloodstream to areas of blood vessel damage. There, they bind together and form a plug to seal the hole in the leaking vessel. If damaged blood vessels are not repaired quickly by the platelets, bleeding—ranging from a small bruise to serious internal hemorrhaging—can occur.
"
"Platelets are normally removed from the body by the liver if they are not used within eight to 12 days. This, in turn, signals the bone marrow to make new platelets.
"
"Although dogs with ITP produce platelets normally, the platelets are destroyed by the immune system after approximately one day. They aren’t regenerated quickly enough to resolve the symptoms before a dog could succumb to this condition.
"
"Since platelets form blood clots to stop and prevent bleeding, a platelet deficiency caused by ITP typically causes internal bleeding and bruising. Signs you may observe in your dog include:
"
"Abnormal bruising
"
"Petechiae: Small pinpoint bruises found on skin and mucosal surfaces (e.g., gums, vulva, or penis)
"
"Ecchymoses: Large bruises
"
"Abnormal bleeding
"
"Melena: Black, tarry stool from bleeding in the stomach or upper small intestines
"
"Bloody diarrhea or blood in the stool
"
"Bleeding from the gums
"
"Epistaxis (nosebleed)
"
"Blood spots in the eyes
"
"Hematemesis (bloody vomit)
"
"Bloody vaginal discharge
"
"Blood in the urine
"
"Lethargy
"
"Reluctance to exercise
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Pale mucus membranes
"
"Fever
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes
"
"Rapid or difficulty breathing
"
"Anemia, which may develop from blood loss
"
"ITP is a relatively common disease that occurs most often in middle-aged, female dogs.
"
"While any dog breed can be affected by ITP, including mixed-breed dogs, Cocker Spaniels, Standard and Toy Poodles, and Old English Sheepdogs are thought to have a genetic predisposition. A familial predisposition has been seen in families of Cocker Spaniels and Scottish Terriers.
"
"Primary ITP is more common than secondary ITP in dogs. Triggers for secondary ITP include:
"
"Medications
"
"Sulfa, cephalosporin, and penicillin antibiotics
"
"Phenobarbital
"
"Fenbendazole
"
"Infectious diseases
"
"Tick-borne diseases (e.g., Lyme disease, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever)
"
"Leishmaniasis
"
"Leptospirosis
"
"Heartworm disease
"
"Parvo
"
"Canine distemper
"
"Salmonellosis
"
"Cancer, most commonly lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma
"
"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
"
"Toxins (e.g., zinc and xylitol)
"
"Venomous snake bites
"
"While it has been suspected that ITP may also be a rare side effect of vaccine administration, studies have not proven an association.
"
"If your dog is showing signs of ITP, particularly abnormal bruising or bleeding, your veterinarian will take a complete medical history, including any medications your dog is taking and recent tick exposure. If your dog has a familial connection that predisposes them to ITP, it is important to inform the veterinary team.
"
"Your vet will then perform a physical examination and likely recommend diagnostic testing. Blood work may include:
"
"A complete blood count (CBC), which includes a total platelet count
"
"A biochemistry profile, which is the checking of organ function and electrolytes
"
"Coagulation times, to make sure a dog’s body can perform a blood clot properly
"
"Tick disease panel, to check for tick-borne diseases such as Lyme
"
"Additionally, a urinalysis and fecal evaluation are typically performed.
"
"Your dog’s blood can also be evaluated under a microscope to confirm low platelet numbers. Additional testing, such as a bone marrow biopsy and imaging techniques, including X-rays and ultrasound, can assess for other underlying causes of ITP.
"
"Primary ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that all causes of secondary ITP must first be ruled out.
"
"Dogs with ITP are usually hospitalized for stabilization and treatment. Treatment may include a blood transfusion, especially if a sudden and excessive blood loss occurred, or a plasma transfusion to help increase platelet numbers quickly.
"
"The mainstay of ITP therapy is medication to suppress the immune system, to stop your dog’s body from destroying its platelets. Steroids such as prednisone are often used, and although they can cause undesirable side effects, including increased thirst, urination, and hunger, the benefits outweigh these short-lived effects.
"
"Supportive care measures, such as supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, antibiotics, and anti-nausea medications, may be used depending on your dog’s symptoms. Rarely, if medications do not control a dog’s ITP or the condition recurs repeatedly, a splenectomy—a surgical procedure to remove the spleen—may be performed.
"
"In ITP, a dog’s immune system attacks platelets. The spleen then removes those platelets from the body. If the spleen is removed, then a dog will have more platelets because the organ won't be removing them.
"
"Once your dog is feeling better and returns home, they will need frequent veterinary rechecks to monitor their progress and therapy.
"
"Immunosuppressive medications are often continued for several months and sometimes for the rest of the dog’s life, depending on the underlying cause of the ITP. With this treatment, the goal is to find the lowest possible dose of medication to keep the immune system at bay.
"
"Most dogs can live a long, happy life after an ITP diagnosis, especially if the underlying cause is treated promptly and aggressively. Full recovery occurs in 70% to 90% of dogs with ITP.
"
"Indications that a dog might not recover completely include:
"
"Black, tarry stool
"
"Increased blood urea nitrogen test (BUN)
"
"Underlying illness severe enough to warrant a blood transfusion
"
"ITP recurrence can be as high as 30% and often occurs two to three months after the initial diagnosis. Removal of the spleen results in remission in 60% of dogs affected with recurrent ITP. 
"
"Unfortunately, for dogs who can’t tolerate immunosuppressive medications, blood transfusions, or splenectomy surgery, ITP can be fatal or may warrant humane euthanasia.
"
"Some causes of secondary ITP can be prevented. Year-round tick prevention is important for all dogs, and especially for dogs who spend a lot of time outside, particularly in the woods or hiking.
"
"Preventing exposure to infectious diseases and venomous snakes can also help decrease your dog’s risk.
"
"Although 70% to 90% of dogs with ITP will fully recover, up to 30% will die or be humanely euthanized due to a poor prognosis.
"
"With quick and aggressive treatment, ITP may not affect your dog’s lifespan.
"
"There are no known natural treatments to suppress the immune system once your dog develops ITP.
"
"Some all-natural tick preventives, such as Wondercide, can help decrease your dog’s risk of developing a tick-borne disease, but they should always be used in conjunction with veterinary-prescribed tick prevention.

"and destroys its own red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in anemia. IMHA can either be primary (no identifiable cause) or secondary (triggered by an underlying condition). In either case, the body no longer recognizes RBCs as part of itself and forms antibodies against the RBCs which results in their destruction by the body. 
"
"Anemia is defined as a deficiency of red blood cells, hemoglobin, or both in the blood. RBCs are the main way oxygen is carried to the tissues and organs of the body. Hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein within RBCs that actually carries the oxygen molecules. 
"
"In anemic dogs, the decrease in RBCs and/or hemoglobin leads to decreased oxygen flow to the body’s organs. This can result in organ damage and even organ failure. Since anemia can quickly become life-threatening, it is a medical emergency. If a pet parent suspects its dog is anemic, go immediately to a local emergency veterinary hospital.

"Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used in humans to relieve pain and reduce fever. It is available in many over-the-counter formulations (Advil, Motrin, Midol, etc.) as well as in prescription-strength medications. Though relatively safe for people, ibuprofen can be toxic for dogs.

"Despite its name, inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, is not a disease but a syndrome that is caused by chronic irritation of the intestinal tract. It stems from multiple factors, which are usually a group of symptoms that occur because of a single disease or combination of diseases.
"
"Whatever the cause, the result is inflammation within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Often coupled with a defective immune system, this inflammation leads to a greater allergic response triggering more inflammation, pain, and thickening of the GI tract. Over time, this results in an inability to digest and absorb nutrients properly. Regardless of its cause or causes, IBD significantly impacts your dog’s quality of life and should not be ignored. 
"
"IBD can affect any part of the GI tract, including the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, or any combination.
"
"IBD should not be confused with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome); IBS is a disease that affects the intestinal muscles, specifically those of the large intestine, and causes constipation and diarrhea in dogs. Fortunately, IBS in dogs is extremely rare.

"The cause of IMHA can be primary or secondary. Primary IMHA is idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown. The body wakes up one day and starts attacking its RBCs seemingly for no reason. Approximately 75% of dogs with IMHA will have primary IMHA. It can occur independently, or with other autoimmune diseases. 
"
"While no cause is identified, there may be a genetic component. The most common breeds with genetic predispositions for IMHA include:

"
"English Springer Spaniel
"
"Old English Sheepdog
"
"Irish Setter
"
"Poodle

"Secondary IMHA means the body attacks the RBCs in response to an underlying problem with them. Common causes of secondary IMHA include:
"
"Parasite such as tick borne diseases including Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Mycoplasma, Babesia
"
"Viral: Chronic persistent upper respiratory or gastrointestinal viruses
"
"Bacterial: Leptospira, various acute and chronic infections

"Ultimately, the cause of poisoning is that the dog ate Advil or another medication containing ibuprofen. Although most cases of ibuprofen ingestion in dogs are accidental, there are instances in which pet owners administer ibuprofen-containing medications to their dog, believing them to be safe.
"
"Giving dogs ibuprofen or other OTC human medications can be extremely hazardous to a pet’s health. You should always consult a veterinarian before administering any nonprescribed medications.
"
"Ibuprofen inhibits COX enzymes, which normally have a protective effect on the mucosal barrier of the gastrointestinal tract, keep blood flowing normally to the kidneys, and help regulate platelet function.
"
"When COX enzymes are inhibited, the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract becomes damaged. This causes symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and intestinal upset, and causes gastric ulcers to form. Reduced blood flow to the kidneys results in kidney damage. Reduced platelet aggregation leads to an increased tendency to bleed abnormally.
"
"After asking you questions regarding the dog's medical history, your veterinarian will perform blood and urine tests in order to assess possible kidney compromise. These test will also check for the appearance of gastrointestinal, renal and neurological signs associated with ibuprofen toxicity in dogs.
"
"Tell your veterinarian if you think or know that your dog ate ibuprofen (or any other medication). She is not going to judge you; she is trying to treat your pet quickly and effectively. We all know that accidents happen.
"
"Do not induce vomiting at home. Activated charcoal may be used to absorb any excess ibuprofen poison in the stomach that has not been vomited out. In some cases, gastric lavage (“pumping the stomach”) may also be necessary. Your veterinarian will determine the best course of action to take with your dog. 
"
"In situations where the kidneys have become damaged due to ibuprofen poisoning, fluid therapy and blood or plasma transfusions will be required. Controlling vomiting in dogs with antiemetic prescription pet medications may be recommended as well as the use of gastrointestinal protectants. Gastric perforation will require surgical correction. Anticonvulsant medications (seizure medications for dogs) may be necessary if seizures occur.
"
"Ibuprofen and dogs do not mix. Keep your pets from accidentally ingesting Advil or other medications containing ibuprofen by securing all drugs in a location that’s inaccessible to your dog.

"
"Excess gas
"
"Melena (black tarry stools)
"
"If left untreated, these symptoms will lead to poor absorption of nutrients, weight loss, abdominal distension, swelling of the extremities, and, in extreme cases, blood clots, which are often fatal.
"
"As a syndrome, IBD often stems from different causes and, unfortunately, in most cases, the underlying cause is never known. Conditions often associated with IBD, all of which cause inflammation of the GI tract and trigger an immune response, include:
"
"Parasitism, often seen with Giardia
"
"Bacterial infections and other infectious agents
"
"Dysbiosis, the alteration of normal bacterial populations within the GI tract
"
"Food allergy or sensitivity
"
"Overactive or exaggerated immune response (often termed “autoimmune”)
"
"Additionally, genetic factors may be a consideration, as some breeds such as Yorkshire Terriers, German Shepherds, and Boxers, are predisposed to the condition.
"
"A physical exam by your veterinarian may offer IBD as a possible diagnosis, but in and of itself the physical exam is not diagnostic. Laboratory testing such as bloodwork, urinalysis, and even imaging such as x-rays and an ultrasound may be recommended. The results of these tests would be supportive of IBD, but ultimately, biopsies of the intestinal tract are needed for a true diagnosis.
"
"As the gold standard, biopsy can be performed via endoscopy, colonoscopy, or exploratory surgery. However, because biopsy can be cost-prohibitive and is invasive, in many cases IBD is presumed.
"
"Supportive information gathered from the above tests may show signs of:
"
"Anemia (low red blood cell count), due to chronic blood loss or inflammation
"
"Low proteins (albumin, cholesterol)
"
"Increased liver enzymes (ALT, ALP)
"
"Gas and fluid distended intestinal segments
"
"Increased thickness of the intestinal walls
"
"Additional tests your veterinarian may recommend include a stool exam for cases of parasitism, blood tests to help determine absorption ability, and an ACTH stimulation test to rule out Addison’s disease (adrenal insufficiency).
"
"Unfortunately, there is no cure for IBD; however, it can be controlled and managed. It’s important to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines throughout treatment, since a combination of medications is typically required to ensure your dog’s well-being.
"
"Anti-inflammatories and immunosuppressives are the mainstay of treatment, with prednisone, budesonide, and azathioprine being the most commonly prescribed. These medications are not without risks. It’s important to discuss the side effects with your veterinarian and to not discontinue their use without your veterinarian’s recommendation. 
"
"Additionally, as food sensitivity is an important factor in IBD, your veterinarian will most likely prescribe a change of diet. This may entail a novel protein diet (consisting of less commonly used sources of protein, such as fish, duck, rabbit, venison, or kangaroo) or a hydrolyzed diet, where the protein is chemically broken into pieces so small that the immune system is less likely to react. In some cases, this may be effective as the sole therapy. 
"
"Based on results of the in-house blood tests, your vet will likely start treatment. However, your veterinarian will probably send additional confirmatory testing to the laboratory. You may hear words such as “Coombs test”, “CBC with pathology review”, and “reticulocyte count”–all designed to give your veterinarian additional information. Baseline serum chemistry (blood tests that measure amounts of certain chemicals in a sample of blood to determine how well certain organs are working) and urinalysis will also be performed. 
"
"The next phase of testing is designed to screen your pet for secondary causes of IMHA. This involves chest X-rays, abdominal ultrasound, and infectious disease testing.
"
"IMHA cannot be cured, but it can be placed into remission and successfully managed in many dogs. Nevertheless, it is a life-threatening condition that will require hospitalization and aggressive therapy, in most cases. 
"
"Occasionally, anemia can be detected early via bloodwork screening. In these cases, IMHA may be detected in its early stages and managed by medications on an outpatient basis. However, most cases will require hospitalization for IV fluids and blood transfusions. The main goal of blood transfusions is to stabilize the pet patient and provide time for the other treatments and medications to take effect. Sometimes dogs will require multiple transfusions. 
"
"The mainstay of treatment for IMHA is immunosuppressive therapy. In the short-term, this is achieved with high-dose steroids such as prednisone, but long-term immunosuppressive medications such as mycophenolate, cyclosporine, and azathioprine are typically started at the same time. 
"
"If the dog was diagnosed with secondary IMHA, additional therapy (such as antibiotics) will be geared toward treatment of the underlying cause. Anticoagulant therapy with clopidogrel (plavix) may also be recommended. 
"
"IMHA cases can be complex, so your veterinarian will create a treatment plan specific to your dog and may consult with or refer you to a veterinary internal medicine specialist. 
"
"Early diagnosis and aggressive therapy are keys to a successful outcomes in IMHA cases. Even with therapy, only approximately 50% of IMHA patients will survive long enough to be discharged from the hospital.   
"
"Most dogs will need to be hospitalized at a 24-hour veterinary emergency hospital for 2-7 days while they receive treatment for IMHA including blood transfusions to help stabilize them.
"
"Once released, the dog will need regular rechecks with their internal medicine specialist or veterinarian to assess its red blood cell count. Over many months, the high dose prednisone is typically weaned down and eventually discontinued, but the long-term immunosuppressive medication(s) may be continued for life.
"
"IMHA is never cured, but with strict adherence to rechecks and medication schedules, it can be successfully managed. Relapse rates range from 11-15%. 
"
"It is important to alert any new veterinary professionals about your dog’s  IMHA condition, even if it is in remission. It is also wise to chart all current medications your dog may be taking.  Future medications, medical conditions, or vaccines have the potential to overstimulate the immune system of a dog with a previous autoimmune condition, and can trigger a remission. Your veterinarian will work with you to manage your dog’s long-term needs.

"
"Given the limitations of stool exams, deworming and an antibiotic trial may also be recommended. Recent studies have shown that probiotics and prebiotics are beneficial in restoring and maintaining GI health and help promote the growth of good bacteria.
"
"Even with the right combination and dose of medications, it is not uncommon for IBD  treatment to take a while. Be patient; it often takes several weeks to see improvement in your dog’s symptoms but working with your veterinarian and adhering to the re-check guidelines and lab tests will be key to tracking your dog’s response to treatment.
"
"IBD is a lifelong condition with no cure. Do not stop treatment without first consulting your veterinarian. Most likely, the drugs originally prescribed will be slowly tapered over the course of several weeks to months, to ensure that the lowest effective dose that controls symptoms and minimizes reactions is used. Your dog’s prognosis will depend on the extent of the syndrome, with a lower chance of long-term recovery for pets with low protein levels. 
"
"Because the immune system is affected, caution should be taken with any medications or injections (such as vaccines) that could cause its stimulation, so be sure to discuss the inherent risks and benefits with your veterinarian prior to administration.

"Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disease in dogs that results in decreased production of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are produced by the thyroid glands, which are located on either side of the neck near the throat. These hormones serve an important role in metabolism. When the glands are not producing enough hormones, the dog’s body functions slow down. 
"
"Dogs with hypothyroidism usually have either inflammation of the thyroid glands or degeneration (deterioration) of the glands. Fortunately, thyroid tumors are fairly uncommon in dogs. 
"
"When it does occur, hypothyroidism is most common in middle-aged dogs, with medium-to-large breed dogs being more commonly affected. Golden Retrievers, Dobermans, Dachshunds, Miniature Schnauzers, Cocker Spaniels, and Irish Setters are among the breeds more predisposed.  
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Dogs with hypothyroidism often show one or more of the following clinical signs: 
"
"Weight gain: This often occurs without an increase in appetite. Many pet parents note that their dog seems to be gaining lots of weight even though they don’t eat that much food. 
"
"Lethargy and laziness: Your dog may prefer to sleep and lie around all day rather than run and play. 
"
"Heat-seeking behavior: Because of their low thyroid hormone and resulting low metabolism, dogs with hypothyroidism constantly run a little cold. Your dog may prefer to lie near the fireplace or on the heat vent to try and stay warm. 
"
"Chronic skin and ear infections: While allergies are relatively common in dogs, chronic skin and ear infections may be a sign of an underlying issue with hypothyroidism. 
"
"Dry and brittle hair with a thinning hair coat: Sometimes a dog with hypothyroidism will lose hair from their back on either side. They may also lose hair from their tail, giving it a rat tail type appearance. 
"
"Increased pigmentation of the skin 
"
"Inability to regrow hair after it’s been shaved 
"
"There are other, less common, signs of hypothyroidism that some dogs develop. Dogs may have reproductive problems, or develop issues with their nervous systems, including nerve pain or dragging their hind legs.  
"
"Dogs with low thyroid may have small, white fat deposits on the surface of their eyes or end up with an eye condition called dry eye, where they don’t produce enough tears. Some dogs even have thickening of the facial skin so the muscles of the face droop.  
"
"The two most common causes of hypothyroidism in dogs are inflammation of the thyroid gland (lymphocytic thyroiditis) and degeneration of the thyroid gland (idiopathic thyroid gland atrophy).  
"
"While we are not sure why these two conditions spontaneously occur in some dogs, we know there is a genetic predisposition. Another rare cause of hypothyroidism in dogs includes cancer. Fortunately, these other causes are only responsible for a small percentage of hypothyroid patients.  
"
"Majority of patients with hypothyroidism have either inflammation of their thyroid gland or degeneration of their thyroid gland, and both conditions can be managed with medication.  
"
"Your veterinarian will start with a physical examination of your dog, including a thorough medical history.  It’s important to share any unusual behaviors you’ve noted in your dog and be sure to include a time frame of when you first noticed these behaviors or physical changes.  
"
"Your vet may want to run some basic bloodwork and a urinalysis to establish your dog’s overall health. If your dog has changes in their skin, your vet may want to do skin scrapes or smears (sample collected by either gently scraping the surface of the skin with a scalpel or by pressing a microscope slide to the skin) to look under a microscope and rule out any secondary skin infections.  
"
"Hypothyroidism is diagnosed with a blood test. Your veterinarian will want to draw blood from your dog to either test in their clinic or send off to an external laboratory for testing.  
"
"Most commonly, this disease is diagnosed by running a screening test called a total thyroxine level (Total T4, or TT4). This test determines your dog’s main thyroid hormone level. If it is low, and your dog has clinical signs of hypothyroidism, this is suggestive of a diagnosis.  
"
"Many veterinarians will then run additional blood tests, either a free T4 level or a full thyroid panel, to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Sometimes dogs can have a low total T4 but not necessarily have hypothyroidism. Occasionally, a dog can have a total T4 that is at the low end of the normal range but still have hypothyroidism. These confirmatory tests can be especially helpful in such cases.  
"
"Hypothyroidism is treated with an oral medication called levothyroxine. This medication is a synthetic form of the thyroid hormone your dog is missing. It is important to note that hypothyroidism is treatable but not curable.  
"
"Your dog will need to stay on their thyroid replacement hormone for life. This pill comes in several different strengths, so your veterinarian will select the appropriate dose for your dog based on weight. They will likely want to re-check bloodwork in one month to ensure no dose changes are required.  
"
"Untreated hypothyroidism can shorten your dog’s life span, as nearly every organ in the body is affected by thyroid hormone and by the metabolism. Dogs with untreated hypothyroidism develop high cholesterol, decreased immune function, a slowed heart rate, and neuromuscular signs.  
"
"These neuromuscular signs may include unsteadiness, a head tilt, and even seizures. While hypothyroidism responds well to treatment, untreated hypothyroidism can have a negative effect on your dog’s quality of life.  
"
"Management of hypothyroidism in dogs requires lifelong therapy with oral thyroid hormone replacement. Tolerance of medication may change over time, so your dog may require dose adjustments from time to time. It is recommended that you have your dog's blood thyroid levels checked every 6-12 months to ensure they are still on the appropriate dose of their medication. It is very important that your dog not be given too little or too much thyroid hormone in the long term.  
"
"Once your dog’s thyroid levels have been restored to normal, your dog may lose weight as their body condition improves and will likely have more energy. While it can take months for your dog’s hair to grow back, they will likely experience an improvement in their skin and hair coat over time.  
"
"Hypothyroidism may result in decreased tear production in dogs. Monitor your dog’s eyes for any development of green-yellow discharge. Talk to your veterinarian if you notice any changes in your dog’s eyes.  
"
"Hypothyroidism is manageable, but it is not curable. It is usually treated with lifelong oral synthetic thyroid hormone replacement (levothyroxine medication).
"
"Thyroid medication can be overdosed, and it is very important that your dog is on the correct dose of medication to manage their hypothyroidism.  
"
"Your vet will start your dog on a standard dose based on your dog’s weight and will want to repeat bloodwork in one month to ensure the dose is correct. More than one re-check appointment is possible to get the medication dosage correct. 
"
"Metabolism and tolerance of the medication may change over time, requiring periodic dose adjustments. It is recommended that your dog’s thyroid levels be re-checked every 6-12 months. Signs of an overdose of thyroid medication include excessive weight loss, irritability/hyperactivity, increased drinking and/or panting, and lack of sleep.  
"
"Dogs with hypothyroidism can live normal, healthy lives when the disease is managed with medication. While the disease is not curable, it has an excellent prognosis and patients generally respond well to treatment. Medically managed patients have a normal life expectancy.

"Hypoglycemia or “low blood sugar” refers to a low level of circulating glucose in the bloodstream. Glucose is a small sugar molecule that comes from dog food and is utilized by their cells for energy. When the amount of sugar in the bloodstream becomes too low, the body starts to show symptoms of not having enough energy to operate. The brain especially needs a steady supply of glucose to function.
"
"Low levels of glucose can be extremely dangerous to a dog, and this condition needs to be treated quickly. If you suspect hypoglycemia, bring your pet to a veterinarian immediately.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The symptoms of hypoglycemia result from insufficient energy reaching organs of the body. These symptoms can come on suddenly or gradually depending on the cause and can also wax and wane.
"
"If you see any of the following symptoms, please contact your veterinarian immediately:
"
"Lack of appetite (anorexia)
"
"Lack of energy/lethargy
"
"Vomiting
"
"Hyperthyroidism is a rare condition caused by the overproduction of hormones made by the thyroid gland found in the neck region. This condition is most often caused by a cancerous tumor within the thyroid, but a benign thyroid mass, diet, and certain supplements can also be contributing factors.
"
"The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland that is on both sides of a dog’s windpipe (trachea). This gland makes thyroid hormones that aid in metabolism and regulation of calcium. When a dog has hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland is overstimulated causing large amounts of thyroid hormones to be produced and released into the body.  These excess thyroid hormones lead to an increase in a dog’s metabolism and higher calcium levels.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Hyperthyroid dogs have an increased metabolism, which leads to hyperactivity and weight loss despite a ravenous (large) appetite. They also tend to have increased calcium, which can cause the following symptoms:
"
"Increased thirst
"
"Increased urination
"
"Decreased energy level
"
"Vomiting
"
"Difficulty defecating (constipation)
"
"Hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD) is an orthopedic developmental disorder that can cause limping, pain, and swelling of a dog’s joints. It can be seen in rapidly growing large breed and giant breed dogs, such as Great Danes, Weimaraners, Labrador Retrievers, and Standard Poodles.
"
"Vets can diagnose HOD in dogs as early as a few months old, and it occurs most frequently in dogs less than 1 year old. Male puppies appear to have a greater likelihood of being affected than female puppies.
"
"HOD in dogs most commonly affects long bones, such as the radius, ulna, and tibia in your dog’s legs. However, it can also occur on bones that make up your pet’s jaw, ribs, or vertebrae, among other locations.
"
"There is a portion of these long bones called the metaphysis that includes something called the growth plate. Growth plates are areas of actively growing cartilage that later hardens into bone during maturity. HOD is seen in young dogs because it affects the metaphysis, which is a rapidly changing area in youth due to the growth plate.
"
"If your dog has HOD, there will be an issue with the blood flow to the metaphysis region of the bone. The change in blood flow means the bone can’t harden properly. When new bone continues to grow without properly hardening first, it causes inflammation and symptoms of HOD in dogs.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The most common sign of hypertrophic osteodystrophy in dogs is a persistent limping—most often in the front legs. Your puppy may pull away or yelp in pain when you touch their legs, and their legs may feel warm. You may also notice leg swelling, particularly near the joints.
"
"Some dogs exhibit diarrhea for a short time before the limping. Your puppy may also feel generally unwell, which will show up as a fever, reduced appetite, or fatigue. They may not want to go for walks or play, and puppies in extreme pain may even be reluctant to stand up.
"
"HOD can come and go until the growth plates have fully matured. With that being said, the disorder sometimes clears up after only one episode. Although HOD is most common in the long bones of a dog’s front legs, keep in mind that it can occur in other bones as well.
"
"Disorientation/weakness/ “star-gazing”
"
"Tremors/seizures
"
"Fainting, loss of consciousness, coma
"
"There are four main categories of issues that can contribute to a dog’s blood sugar dropping lower than normal. Diseases can fall into one or more of these categories:
"
"Poor dietary intake of glucose or glucose-making molecules
"
"Puppy or toy breed hypoglycemia
"
"Malnutrition
"
"Hunting dog hypoglycemia
"
"Increased glucose demand
"
"Insulin overdose in diabetics
"
"Xylitol toxicity
"
"Insulinoma
"
"Cancer
"
"Insufficient utilization of or the inability to make body stores of energy molecules
"
"Portosystemic shunt
"
"Chronic renal failure
"
"Liver failure
"
"Liver cancer
"
"Severe infection or sepsis
"
"Endocrine-system abnormalities causing hormonal imbalances
"
"Addison's disease, a.k.a. hypoadrenocorticism
"
"Hyperpituitarism
"
"After examining your pet and obtaining a medical history, your veterinarian will initiate testing. These tests may include:
"
"Blood glucose test—a simple bedside test that looks at blood sugar levels only.
"
"Chemistry/complete blood count—a more in-depth blood test that checks red and white blood cell levels, glucose level, electrolytes, and organ function. This may be done in the hospital but may also need to be sent out to a laboratory.
"
"Additional testing might be needed, based on initial results and your pet’s clinical signs and medication history:
"
"Bloodwork
"
"Bile acids—to look for liver damage
"
"If the cause of the hyperthyroidism is a cancerous mass in the thyroid gland, then this tumor can often be palpated (touched) within the neck region and cause coughing, difficulty breathing, difficulty eating, and alter the tone of a dog’s bark.
"
"The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in dogs is a cancerous thyroid mass that can be either a thyroid carcinoma or thyroid adenocarcinoma that overproduces thyroid hormones. Thyroid masses usually exist within the thyroid gland. However, there can be thyroid tissue in abnormal places. This is referred to as an ectopic thyroid tissue, and can be present under a dog’s tongue, or at the base of the heart. As a result, thyroid tumors can occasionally be found in those areas and lead to hyperthyroidism. Rarely, a benign mass called a thyroid adenoma within the thyroid gland can also cause hyperthyroidism.
"
"Dogs that consume commercial raw meat diets contaminated with thyroid tissue can develop hyperthyroidism. Supplements that contain kelp or seaweed can trigger hyperthyroidism if ingested. This condition can also occur because of overmedication with thyroid supplements when a dog has hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).
"
"Any breed of dog is susceptible to getting hyperthyroidism. However, the dog breeds that have a higher incidence of developing a thyroid tumor are Beagles, Boxers, Golden Retrievers, and Siberian Huskies. Hyperthyroidism occurs most often in older dogs.
"
"The following diagnostics are needed to diagnose a dog with hyperthyroidism:
"
"Routine physical exam: A veterinarian may palpate a mass in the neck region or find a mass under the tongue. An elevated heart rate, elevated temperature, weak pulses, or rapid weight loss may also be noted. Enlarged lymph nodes may or may not be found during the exam.
"
"Comprehensive bloodwork: This consists of a blood cell count (CBC), chemistry panel that includes calcium level, and a thyroid panel. The bloodwork results usually include abnormal thyroid levels and an elevated calcium level.
"
"Urinalysis: Dogs with hyperthyroidism often drink more water and urinate more frequently.  A urinalysis test is needed to rule out the most common causes of increased thirst and urination such as a urinary tract infection, kidney disease, and diabetes. The urinalysis results for a dog with hyperthyroidism are normal. 
"
"Ultrasound of the neck: If a mass is palpable in the neck region, ultrasound is used to determine if the mass is within the thyroid gland and the size of the tumor.  
"
"Ultrasound of the heart: Also called an Echo, this may be needed to check for an ectopic thyroid mass that can be found at the base of the heart.
"
"CT scan or MRI: This advanced imaging may be needed to measure the mass and diagnose if the tumor has adhered to surrounding tissue. This will help figure out if the mass can be surgically removed.
"
"Thyroid scintigraphy: This diagnostic test, also known as a thyroid scan, may be offered to visualize the thyroid gland to determine if a mass is present.
"
"A biopsy or fine needle aspirate and cytology of a thyroid mass are not recommended because the thyroid gland is very vascular (comprised of blood vessels), and aspirates or biopsies of the tumor are often inconclusive because of the amount of red blood cells in the sample. There is also a risk of severe hemorrhage if a needle or biopsy tool is inserted into a thyroid tumor.
"
"Surgery: If a thyroid tumor is found and is not attached to surrounding tissue, then surgical removal of the thyroid tumor, called a thyroidectomy, is recommended. Surgery can also be performed to remove a thyroid mass under the tongue or at the base of the heart. If surgery cannot be performed quickly, then an oral medication called methimazole may be prescribed to manage thyroid levels until surgery.
"
"If a thyroid tumor is attached to surrounding tissue, then surgical removal of the entire tumor is not possible. A surgeon can surgically remove most of the tumor (debulk the tumor) and then schedule chemotherapy and/or radiation to treat the tumor cells that remain.
"
"Aspiration pneumonia is a common complication after a thyroidectomy, so the patient pet needs to be watched closely for signs of respiratory distress.
"
"Radiation therapy: Radiation can be pursued if metastatic cancer is present, or if surgery is too dangerous to pursue based on the size of the mass or how invasive it is to surrounding tissues.
"
"High-dose radioactive iodine (I-131) therapy: This is an effective treatment option for cancerous thyroid masses that cannot be surgically removed or have metastasized. It is also used if some residual cancerous cells are left behind following a thyroidectomy.
"
"Chemotherapy: There are several chemotherapy drugs that have been used for treating hyperthyroidism caused by a cancerous thyroid mass. The drugs that have been found to be most effective are toceranib phosphate (Palladia), doxorubicin, and cisplatin.
"
"Diet change or discontinuing seaweed/kelp supplements: For dogs that have hyperthyroidism due to consuming commercial raw meat diets containing thyroid tissue—or supplements with seaweed or kelp— the best treatment involves stopping the diet or supplement.
"
"Adjusting thyroid supplement dose: Dogs receiving an overdose of thyroid supplementation for management of hypothyroidism need to have their dosage decreased to prevent symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
"
"Palliative care for cancerous thyroid tumors: If a pet parent does not wish to pursue surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation to treat their dog, Methimazole medication and Hill’s y/d diet can be used to manage hyperthyroidism by decreasing production of thyroid hormones. This treatment option provides palliative care and helps to reduce symptoms for a period. It does not address the thyroid tumor, so growth of the tumor continues, and it can still spread to other areas of the body.

"Hypertrophic osteodystrophy is a developmental disorder, and the exact cause remains unknown at this time. It has been hypothesized that there may be a genetic component causing HOD in dogs.
"
"Another contributing factor can be eating an unbalanced diet for a growing, large breed puppy. Make sure your large breed puppy has an appropriate puppy diet that offers the right nutrients for large breeds. Ask your vet for a recommendation or ask them about any dog food formulas you are considering.
"
"Large breed and giant breed dogs are prone to HOD. These include but are not limited to the following:
"
"Great Danes
"
"Weimaraners
"
"Boxers
"
"Labrador Retrievers
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Standard Poodles
"
"Great Pyrenees
"
"X-rays are very important in diagnosing hypertrophic osteodystrophy in dogs. Your vet may suspect HOD based on your puppy’s breed, age, physical exam results, and symptoms, but an x-ray is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis.
"
"Your puppy may also undergo additional tests, like bloodwork or urinalysis, as there can be other conditions that need to be treated alongside the pain, such as diarrhea, anorexia, or pneumonia.
"
"Treatment for hypertrophic osteodystrophy includes managing your dog’s symptoms and relieving their pain. HOD is a very painful condition, which is why it is super important to seek medical care for your puppy.
"
"Your vet will most likely prescribe a (dog-safe) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for pain control and give you instructions for exercise restriction.
"
"Your vet will review your dog’s diet, and if they are not on a balanced diet intended for growing large breed and giant breed puppies, they will likely be switched to one. Your vet may also advise removing supplements from your dog’s diet.
"
"If your dog needs additional treatment, steroids may be prescribed during an episode of HOD. If your vet prescribes your puppy a steroid, it is especially important to follow dosing and tapering instructions to prevent further problems.
"
"Some puppies can develop diarrhea, fevers, and pneumonia, which all require further treatment specific to those conditions. If your dog is not getting up and lies in the same spot all day, you will need to regularly turn them to prevent bedsores as well.
"
"Severe cases of HOD in dogs may require more intensive management, potentially including a hospital stay for IV fluid therapy, nutritional management (sometimes, a feeding tube is necessary), and stronger pain management than you can give your dog at home.
"
"The most severe cases can result in euthanasia if it is the only humane option when your dog’s pain cannot be managed and their quality of life deteriorates.
"
"It is important to understand that HOD symptoms can only be managed; there is no cure for HOD in dogs.
"
"Most dogs with mild to moderate HOD will recover and go on to lead a normal life. Untreated or severe cases may result in limb deformities, which can cause long-term effects on your dog’s posture and their ability to walk, run, and play.
"
"After treatment, your dog may feel better in as little as 7-10 days, but keep in mind that the signs may reoccur. For puppies that experience additional episodes of HOD while they are growing, institute pain management as needed each time.
"
"The clinical signs associated with HOD in dogs can resolve in as little as one week with appropriate treatment. However, there is a chance of relapse until your dog’s long bones have finished growing. HOD in dogs cannot be cured, but it can be managed.
"
"There is a suspected genetic component to HOD in Weimaraners, but the research is ongoing in this breed as well as other large breed and giant breed dogs. Until further research is completed, we cannot know for sure whether HOD in dogs is truly hereditary.

"Hormone-level testing— may include resting cortisol levels or an ACTH stim test to look for Addison’s disease
"
"Insulin/glucose ratio test—checks for circulating insulin and glucose levels to look for a potential cancer in the pancreas called an insulinoma
"
"Imaging— may include radiographs/x-rays or abdominal ultrasound to check for certain types of cancer, liver disease, adrenal gland disease, or other possible causes.
"
"Treatment will depend on the severity of the situation. For pets with minimal symptoms, oral liquid glucose may be sufficient. For moderate to severe symptoms, your pet will likely be admitted to the hospital for care, which will, at a minimum, consist of intravenous (IV) fluid therapy that contains a sugar called dextrose to help bring your pet’s blood sugar up, even if it’s not eating. Additional treatments may be needed based on the initial cause of your pet’s hypoglycemia.
"
"In a pet patient that had mild uncomplicated hypoglycemia, recovery is generally swift, and feeding the dog frequent small meals high in fats, protein, and complex carbohydrates will most likely be recommended. This is especially true for toy breeds and puppies recovering from hypoglycemia. Monitoring these patients to ensure they are eating is important to recovery.
"
"Pets with moderate-to-severe or complex hypoglycemia may be hospitalized, and recovery is guarded. Treatment of the underlying cause of hypoglycemia is often necessary. For diabetic dogs, your veterinarian may recommend that you do not administer insulin, or the specialist may adjust the insulin dosage for a period after your pet is home.
"
"Prevention of hypoglycemia is highly dependent on the cause. For diabetic dogs, routine glucose monitoring after insulin administration is necessary. This may be done at home or in your vet’s office. With puppies and toy breeds, it is important to ensure that these pets are eating a high-quality diet in small, frequent meals to keep their glucose levels regulated. Patients that have underlying disease processes should be monitored frequently at their vet’s office.
"
"The four most common symptoms of hypoglycemia are:
"
"Weakness/lethargy
"
"Vomiting
"
"Seizures
"
"Fainting
"
"Hypoglycemia will last until adequate amounts of glucose are provided to the organs lacking this energy source. The lower a pet’s blood sugar has become and the longer the levels have been low, the longer it will take to recover. Pets with underlying issues that contributed to the low blood sugar level will also take longer to recover.
"
"When a dog’s blood sugar levels are too low, the body lacks the energy to perform normal functions. Symptoms can occur rapidly or gradually, depending on the cause, and may include weakness, vomiting, seizures, or fainting.

"Prognosis depends on the cause of the hyperthyroidism. If there is a benign tumor, then surgery is curative. If diet or a supplement is the cause of the hyperthyroidism, discontinuing these will resolve the condition. Decreasing the dosage of the thyroid supplement for hypothyroid dogs that are overmedicated will resolve the hyperthyroid symptoms.
"
"Treating a cancerous thyroid tumor can be challenging and will depend on a few factors. If the tumor is moveable and not adhered to surrounding tissue, then surgical removal can prolong the dog’s life by approximately three years. In contrast, if the tumor is large or adhered to surrounding tissue, then surgical removal is unlikely to remove the entire tumor, and further treatment is needed to manage the cancer. Radiation or radioactive iodine therapy for non-metastatic thyroid tumors can also yield a survival time of between one and three years.
"
"Cancerous thyroid tumors have a high probability of spreading to other areas of the body, like the regional lymph nodes. This is called metastasis. If metastasis is present, then the prognosis is poor, and chemotherapy would be needed to try to treat the cancer in various locations of the body. Survival time is typically less than a year with treatment for metastasized thyroid tumors.
"
"Dogs that have a thyroidectomy may become hypothyroid after surgery, which means that they have low thyroid hormones and need to take a long-term thyroid supplement to manage hypothyroidism. Also, some dogs will develop low calcium levels after surgery and need to be started on a calcium supplement.
"
"Any dog breed can acquire hyperthyroidism. However, the dog breeds that have a higher incidence of developing a thyroid tumor are Beagles, Boxers, Golden Retrievers, and Siberian Huskies.
"
"A goiter refers to an enlargement of the thyroid gland due a benign medical condition, such as congenital hypothyroidism, or a side effect to an oral antibiotic called trimethoprim-sulfa. Once the underlying cause is treated, the goiter resolves.
"
"A dog that has a non-adhered, cancerous thyroid tumor has a life expectancy of up to three years if surgery, radiation, or radioactive iodine therapy is performed to treat hyperthyroidism. If metastasis is present, then survival time is less than a year with treatment options such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or radioactive iodine therapy.

"Hyperthermia is a general term for an abnormal increased body temperature. In dogs, the normal high-end temperature is 102.5-103 F. Dogs with temperatures above 103 F are considered hyperthermic. Increasing body temperatures, if they grow or remain high enough, can cause whole-body inflammation or blood-related issues such as coagulation complications, and this may lead to multi-organ failure.
"
"Once a dog’s body temperature starts rising, regardless of cause, it is a life-threatening emergency. If a dog shows signs of hyperthermia, immediately contact an emergency veterinarian and start the following cooling process:
"
"Begin cooling your dog while on your way to a veterinarian.
"
"Soak the dog in water, especially around the groin, armpits, and neck.
"
"Do not use cold water or ice, because this can cause blood vessel constriction and delay cooling. Use lukewarm to cool water.
"
"Use car vents and fans to blow air on the dog.
"
"Offer small amounts of cool (not cold) drinking water.
"
"Do not submerge the dog’s head in water.
"
"Contact an emergency veterinarian to let them know you are on the way, and ask for any other instructions.
"
"Depending on the cause, hyperthermia can progress rapidly, leading to life-altering permanent systemic damage, sometimes within minutes. Delaying veterinary treatment more than 90 minutes often results in a decreased survival rate. 
"
"Regardless of the cause, hyperthermia causes extreme damage to the body. Initially, dogs may seem distressed, pant, or be unsteady or restless. They may drool, or their gums may turn blue or bright red. As hyperthermia progresses, clinical signs include:
"
"Collapse
"
"Spontaneous bleeding
"
"Dehydration
"
"Seizures
"
"Extreme lethargy, progressing to a comatose state
"
"In general, hyperthermia has two causes:
"
"Infections (such as bacteria or viruses) trigger a fever, where the body’s core temperature rises as a response.
"
"External conditions, where other factors cause the body to increase in temperature. In this scenario, a dog’s body cannot dissipate the heat appropriately, so the body temperature continues to rise.
"
"The most common external conditions causing hyperthermia include the following:
"
"Heatstroke often occurs when the temperature outside is high and there is a lack of good ventilation. This type of heatstroke occurs in the absence of exercise, is also known as non-exertional, and is the most common type of heatstroke that veterinarians treat.
"
"Exercise-induced heatstroke, or exertional heatstroke, occurs after strenuous play or activity.
"
"Malignant hyperthermia is a rare reaction to anesthesia or other drugs in which muscles experience increased contractions and break down, causing increased body temperature.
"
"Toxicity from substances such as hops, excessive thyroid hormone, or compounds that lead to seizures can also cause hyperthermia.
"
"Hyperthermia occurs more often in the summer, especially in hot and humid climates, but can occur at any time in any environment. Risk factors for hyperthermia include:
"
"Brachycephalic, or short-nosed, breeds, such as Pugs, English Bulldogs, and Boston Terriers
"
"Overweight dogs
"
"Dogs with breathing conditions, such as laryngeal paralysis or obstructive airway disease
"
"Age: Young puppies and senior dogs are each at higher risk
"
"Hyperthyroidism
"
"Thick hair coats
"
"Young male dogs may be more likely to suffer from exercise-induced heatstroke
"
"Dogs most commonly suffer from hyperthermia and heatstroke when they are trapped in a vehicle or other enclosed places like sheds or kennels.
"
"Other causes include excessive exercise, especially in hot or humid environments. The heat production from muscle activity, often while hiking, hunting, or jogging with owners, raises the body temperature to potentially dangerous levels.
"
"Dogs are unable to sweat like humans, and instead use panting to cool their body off. This makes it difficult for Pugs and other brachycephalic breeds, with their flat faces, to dissipate heat as efficiently as other breeds.
"
"Malignant hyperthermia is a genetic condition in which a dog is susceptible to hyperthermia from anesthesia. Malignant hyperthermia can occur in any breed, but the following breeds may be at higher risk:
"
"St. Bernard
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"Greyhound
"
"Border Collie
"
"English Springer Spaniel
"
"Irish Wolfhound
"
"Cocker Spaniel
"
"Doberman Pinscher
"
"Siberian Husky
"
"Pointer
"
"Exposure to known toxic agents such as hops, mycotoxins, and compounds that cause seizures like strychnine and metaldehyde can all cause hyperthermia.
"
"In all cases of hyperthermia, neurological damage can begin at 105.8 F. Temperatures above 106.7 F cause cellular death, and temperatures above 109 degrees are usually fatal.
"
"Veterinarians usually suspect hyperthermia from a dog’s behavior, physical condition, and history. Taking a dog’s temperature rectally confirms the diagnosis.
"
"Once a veterinarian confirms the diagnosis, they will order multiple tests to determine the extent of damage. This can include a complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis for a baseline evaluation.  Veterinarians will monitor these tests before, during, and after the resolution of clinical signs.
"
"Safely cooling a hyperthermic dog before getting to the hospital is key to increasing your pet’s chances of survival.

Prior to getting your dog to a veterinarian, begin cooling your dog in transit. Do not use cold water or ice, because this can cause blood vessel constriction and actually delay cooling. Instead, lukewarm or cool water and car vents and fans should be utilized. The dog can be soaked in water, especially around the groin, armpits, and neck. However, use caution to not submerge the head in water. Offer small amounts of cool drinking water and call the veterinarian on the way and ask for additional instructions.
"
"In most cases, a dog will need to be hospitalized. Once under veterinary care, dogs in respiratory distress require oxygen supplementation and may even need intubation. Dogs in this situation are scared—they feel sick, cannot get enough oxygen, and may panic, which causes a further increase of body temperature.
"
"These dogs may need sedatives to help them calm down, and all dogs will receive intravenous fluid therapy to hydrate and deliver medications. Other treatments vary, depending on the severity and clinical signs, including:
"
"Glucose supplementation
"
"Antibiotics
"
"Gastrointestinal protectants
"
"Blood products to treat bleeding disorders
"
"Cardiac drugs
"
"Pain management drugs
"
"Mild cases of heatstroke caught early may resolve the same day. More serious and complicated cases of hyperthermia likely require hospitalization with close monitoring. Correction of the body temperature stops ongoing damage to cells, but only time and extensive veterinary care can correct the injury already done. Veterinarians will continuously monitor temperature, pulse, respiration, coagulation parameters, and other blood work to monitor organ function until they all return to normal.
"
"Unfortunately, due to the severity of hyperthermia, the prognosis is guarded. Approximately half of hyperthermic patients ultimately die or are euthanized. Treatment is expensive and intensive, with hospital stays averaging 1 to 6 days. Dogs with low blood sugar, coagulation changes, cardiac arrhythmias, and kidney injury are less likely to survive until discharge. Patients are more likely to return home if they survive the first 3 days after the incident.
"
"At home, pet parents are urged to ensure their dog doesn’t overheat again. This may include more fans or air conditioning and never leaving dogs outside unsupervised. Pet parents should keep dogs quiet at home while they are recovering.
"
"The single most important preventative factor for hyperthermia is to never leave your dog inside a car or other enclosed area. Even on cooler days, the inside of a car can increase by 40 F within an hour. On hot days, only go outside for short periods of time and only exercise in early morning or late evening when temperatures are cooler.
"
"Ensure appropriate access to water, and especially monitor dogs who have previously suffered from heatstroke. Obese and overweight dogs are also more likely to become hyperthermic, so always discuss a proper and healthy weight for your dog with your veterinarian. These preventatives factors are especially critical for brachycephalic breeds but apply to all dogs.
"
"Early recognition of hyperthermia is key. If you’re concerned your dog is suffering from hyperthermia, contact your veterinarian immediately and begin cooling procedures. Dog breeds at risk for malignant hyperthermia should talk to their veterinarian about genetic testing.
"
"The most common signs are panting, restlessness, and collapse.
"
"Dogs can survive hyperthermia, but early intervention is critical.
"
"Heat, humidity, and extreme exercise are the most common triggers of hyperthermia in dogs.

"Hyperpigmentation is a darkening and thickening of a dog’s skin. It typically appears as black spots, splotches, or patches.
"
"Hyperpigmentation is not a disease, but a reaction that commonly occurs in addition to chronic inflammation associated with an underlying medical condition. 
"
"If you notice any change in the color or texture of your dog’s skin, have them examined by their veterinarian to determine the underlying cause.
"
"While hyperpigmentation is not an emergency, it’s important to ensure the medical condition causing the hyperpigmentation is treated properly. This will prevent further damage to a dog’s skin.
"
"The two main signs of hyperpigmentation are discoloration and thickening of a dog’s skin.
"
"Hyperpigmentation can occur as pinprick-sized areas of rough, light brown or black skin, and can grow to be quite large.
"
"Areas of hyperpigmentation are often hairless and commonly occur on a dog’s legs, armpits, or groin.
"
"These dark areas may be surrounded by red skin if there is an associated skin infection. Over time, hyperpigmentation can spread to the lower neck, abdomen, ankles, rear end, eyes, or ears, and is often the result of itching or friction associated with the underlying cause.
"
"Hyperpigmentation may progress to more severe skin issues—such as extensive hair loss, a secondary infection, or oozing skin—if the underlying cause is not identified and treated.

"Primary hyperpigmentation, which is not caused by an underlying medical condition, is rare and breed-specific, thought to occur only in Dachshunds. Signs typically develop before pups are a year old.
"
"Secondary hyperpigmentation is caused by inflammation or friction against the skin. Secondary hyperpigmentation can occur in any dog breed, although breeds that are predisposed to certain underlying conditions are more susceptible.
"
"Common causes of hyperpigmentation include:
"
"Obesity, commonly seen in breeds including:
"
"Labrador Retrievers, Pugs, Dachshunds, English Bulldogs, Cairn Terriers, Beagles, Cocker Spaniels, Rottweilers
"
"Hormonal abnormalities
"
"Hypothyroidism, most often seen in the following breeds:
"
"Golden Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers, Dachshunds, Miniature Schnauzer, Cocker Spaniels, Irish Setters
"
"Cushing's disease, commonly seen in breeds including:
"
"Miniature Poodles, Dachshunds, Boxers, Boston Terriers, Yorkshire Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers
"
"Allergies, most often seen in the following breeds:
"
"Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds, Basset Hounds, Jack Russell Terriers, Lhasa Apsos, Irish Setters, Yorkshire Terriers
"
"Contact dermatitis, commonly seen in breeds including:
"
"Border Collies, German Shepherds, Dalmatians, Doberman Pinschers, Great Danes, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers
"
"Skin infections (bacteria, yeast), most often seen in the following breeds:
"
"Cocker Spaniels, Standard Poodles, Shar-Peis, American Bulldogs, Doberman Pinschers, English Bulldogs, Labrador Retrievers, American Pitbull Terriers
"
"Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), commonly seen in breeds including:
"
"Afghan Hounds, Beagles, Collies, German Shepherds, Irish Setters, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers, Old English Sheepdogs, Standard Poodles, Shetland Sheepdogs
"
"Demodicosis (parasitic skin mites), most often seen in the following breeds:
"
"Juvenile onset (young dogs)—English Bulldogs, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, Shar-Peis, Dogue de Bordeaux, Pugs, French Bulldogs, Boxers.
"
"Adult onset—Shar-Peis, Shih-Tzus, West Highland White Terriers, Boxers, Border Terriers.
"
"A diagnosis of hyperpigmentation is usually made when a vet looks at the characteristic dark skin lesions. If primary hyperpigmentation is suspected, all other causes must first be ruled out first.
"
"To determine the underlying cause of secondary hyperpigmentation, your veterinarian will take a thorough medical history of your pup and perform a physical exam. Skin impression smears (a collection of material from the surface of the skin for analysis) and scrapings (collection of material from deeper in the skin) are performed to test for bacterial, yeast, or mite infections.
"
"A skin biopsy may be needed if your dog has signs of lupus.
"
"Hyperphosphatemia is the term for high phosphorus levels in the blood. Phosphorus is a mineral found in bones that, together with calcium, helps to build strong, healthy bone structure. Phosphorus also helps to maintain cell structures and aids in cell energy production. Most of the phosphorus in a dog’s body is stored in bone, but a small percentage is present in the blood.  
"
"Calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship. When phosphorus levels in the blood are high, calcium levels tend to be lower. For this reason, clinical signs of high phosphorus correlate with clinical signs of too little calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). 
"
"Phosphorus is absorbed in the small intestine and is released in the urine. The kidneys and parathyroid glands are important in maintaining phosphorus levels. Diseases associated with the kidneys, bones, parathyroid gland, or gastrointestinal tract can lead to hyperphosphatemia. The most common disease leading to hyperphosphatemia is chronic renal failure (CRF). 
"
"Signs of kidney disease can be seen in cases of chronic, or long-lasting, hyperphosphatemia. These symptoms include increased thirst and urination, diluted urine, dehydration, or inappropriate urination. In animal that already have been diagnosed with chronic renal failure, hyperphosphatemia can speed up the progression of this disease. 
"
"In high levels, phosphate can combine with calcium to create a solid. This causes a syndrome called metastatic mineralization, which means the decomposition of chemical compounds in otherwise normal tissues. The most common body systems aﬀected by metastatic mineralization are the urinary system (the kidneys in particular) and the gastrointestinal system. Symptoms of metastatic mineralization can include muscle tremors, muscle atrophy, or seizures. 
"
" 
"
"The parathyroid hormone is responsible for regulating calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, increasing blood calcium levels by causing calcium to be reabsorbed from bone. The parathyroid glands are small, hormone-secreting glands that are located on or near the thyroid glands. The term para- refers to adjacent or alongside, and thyroid refers to the actual thyroid gland; the thyroid and parathyroid glands are located side by side in the neck, near the windpipe or trachea. Hyperparathyroidism is a medical condition related to the parathyroid glands, in which over active parathyroid glands cause abnormally high levels of parathyroid hormone (also known as parathormone or PTH) to circulate in the blood.
"
" 
"
"Primary hyperparathyroidism refers to a condition in which a tumor in the parathyroid gland produces excessive levels of parathyroid hormone, leading to increased blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia).
"
" 
"
"Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be caused by a deficiency of calcium and vitamin D, and is associated with malnutrition or long-term (chronic) kidney disease.
"
" 
"
"There is no known genetic cause for primary hyperparathyroidism, but its association with certain breeds suggests a possible hereditary basis in some cases. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can develop in association with hereditary kidney disease (known as hereditary nephropathy), but is not inherited per se. Keeshonds seem to show some predilection for this disease. In dogs, the average age is ten years, with a range of 5 to 15 years of age.

"Blood and urine testing may also be performed to screen for hormonal conditions such as hypothyroidism. If Cushing's disease is suspected based on blood work and exam results, specialized blood testing and an abdominal ultrasound may be performed to assess the adrenal glands, which secrete substances such as stress hormones.
"
"If allergies are suspected, a thorough dermatology work-up including skin testing, cultures, a hypoallergenic food trial, and dermal skin testing may be needed.
"
"Treatment for secondary hyperpigmentation is based on the underlying cause. For example, thyroid supplements can be given for hypothyroidism and oral medications can be given for Cushing's disease.
"
"If your dog's hyperpigmentation is due to obesity, a weight loss plan including a special diet and exercise may be instituted.
"
"If your dog's signs are more severe, injectable and prescription medications—such as allergy medication, steroids, and immune-changing drugs—may be necessary.
"
"If a skin infection is present, the infection is often treated with oral medications (such as antibiotics, antifungals) before the underlying cause can be fully determined and treated.
"
"If skin inflammation is in its early stages, topical treatments—such as medicated shampoos, steroid ointments, and anti-itch creams, sprays, wipes, or mousse—may be helpful.
"
"Medicated shampoos can be used two to three times per week and are most effective if the lather stays on a pup’s skin at least 10 minutes before it is rinsed off. Between baths, other topical treatments can be used to soothe the skin and keep it clean and dry.
"
"There is not an easy fix for most cases and treatment requires time and patience.
"
"Unfortunately, there is no cure for primary hyperpigmentation in Dachshunds; however, treating the symptoms can help your dog feel more comfortable.
"
"Most causes of hyperpigmentation in dogs will cause them to have relapses over time.
"
"Frequent veterinary visits and following all instructions—including giving all medications and topical treatments exactly as prescribed—are key in managing your dog’s symptoms.
"
"It can take weeks to months for your dog's skin to return to normal. However, in some cases, a dog’s affected skin does not return to its normal color.
"
"Unfortunately, most causes of hyperpigmentation in dogs are not preventable.
"
"Obesity can be prevented by feeding your dog well-balanced, portioned meals, limiting treats, and providing routine exercise.
"
"Hyperpigmentation should always be a cause for concern—make a vet appointment to determine whether there is an underlying medical problem.
"
"Some causes of hyperpigmentation are easily treated, while others need constant care and routine veterinary check-ups.
"
"Fortunately, most causes of hyperpigmentation in dogs are not dangerous and the diagnosis does not typically impact your dog's lifespan or happiness.
"
"Depending on the underlying cause of your dog’s hyperpigmentation, you may be able to treat them at home. However, the initial diagnosis will require a veterinary visit. Speak with your vet about treatment options at home.

"Hyperphosphatemia in dogs can also cause lethargy, depression, or loss of appetite. 
"
"Young, growing dogs can have higher phosphorus levels due to increased growth hormone in their systems and increased need for phosphorus for bone development. Older dogs are more likely to have diseases that will eventually lead to the development of chronic ￼hyperphosphatemia. 
"
"Kidney disease is the most common cause of hyperphosphatemia in dogs. However, it can also be related to increased absorption of phosphorus through the gastrointestinal tract or through ￼transcellular shifting (transport of solutes by a cell through a cell) of phosphorus, usually from bone. 
"
"Hyperphosphatemia can also be related to: 
"
"Vitamin D toxicity  
"
"Enema intoxication through the use of phosphate-containing enemas  
"
"Urinary tract obstruction 
"
"Endocrinopathies (hyperthyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism) 
"
"Cancer  
"
"Nutritional supplementation  
"
"Bladder rupture  
"
"Bone or muscle disease  
"
"Xylitol intoxication 
"
"Snakebites 
"
"Acromegaly (overproduction of growth hormone) 
"
"Occasionally, phosphorus will be elevated in cases of serious trauma or in conditions such as acute tumor lysis syndrome (seen most commonly with end stage tumors) and rhabdomyolysis, which is a muscular disorder. 
"
"Hyperphosphatemia is diagnosed through a blood work profile called a biochemistry panel. Other diagnostic methods may be needed to discover the underlying cause of hyperphosphatemia. Those include imaging or additional bloodwork (such as thyroid testing or a complete blood count).
"
"Hospitalization may be needed in severe cases of hyperphosphatemia. Your dog may receive IV fluid therapy and medications such as dextrose, insulin, aluminum hydroxide, or calcium carbonate that can help to decrease phosphorus in the blood. 
"
"When dogs are diagnosed with chronic elevations of blood phosphorus, they are commonly treated orally with phosphate binders. Dietary restriction of phosphorus is recommended through switching your dog to a low protein or prescription renal care diets. Because phosphorus and calcium bind together, in some cases restricting calcium intake is also recommended. 
"
"Your veterinarian will be looking for cancer first and foremost for the cause for this disease. However, several other possibilities will also be considered, such as renal failure and vitamin D intoxication, which have been known to be found in some rodenticides. Other possibilities are too much calcium in the blood. A urinalysis will reveal calcium and phosphate levels.
"
" 
"
"Serum ionized calcium determination is often normal in patients with chronic renal failure and high in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia that is associated with a malignancy. If kidney stones are suspected, your veterinarian may use X-ray and ultrasound imaging of the parathyroid gland to discover whether there is tumor there. If nothing can be found using these diagnostic techniques, your veterinarian may need to use surgery to explore the area of the thyroid and parathyroid.
"
" 
"
"
"
" 
"
"Primary hyperparathyroidism generally requires inpatient care and surgery. Secondary hyperparathyroidism related to malnutrition or long-term (chronic) kidney disease in non-critical patients can be managed on an outpatient basis. Your veterinarian may recommend calcium supplements to stabilize the levels of calcium in the blood and intestines. Low phosphorus diets for secondary hyperparathyroidism related to long-term kidney disease may be recommended as well. Surgery is the treatment of choice for primary hyperparathyroidism and is often important in establishing the diagnosis. If a tumor is found, the best resolution is often surgical removal of the tumor. Medications will be prescribed according to the final diagnosis and treatment plan.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"No strategies exist for prevention of primary hyperparathyroidism; however, secondary hyperparathyroidism related to malnutrition is prevented by proper nutrition.
"
" 
"
"Postoperative low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia) is relatively common after surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands for treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, especially in patients with presurgical calcium concentrations greater than 14 mg/d. Your veterinarian will want to check serum calcium concentrations once or twice daily for at least one week after surgery, and will schedule your dog for regular blood tests to check the status of the kidney.

"Secondary hyperparathyroidism refers to the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) due to chronic kidney failure. More specifically, the cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism is absolute or relative lack of calcitriol production -- a form of vitamin D that stimulates the absorption of calcium in the intestines, calcium resorption in bone, and promotes the effectiveness of the parathyroid hormone in aiding bone resorption. Low concentrations of calcium also play a role in increased levels of PTH in blood.
"
"The majority of symptoms relate to the underlying cause of chronic kidney failure. In some patients with chronic kidney disease, bone resorption starts around the teeth and jaw, causing a loosening of the teeth and a softening of the lower jaw, a condition known in the medical community as “rubber jaw.”
"
"Any underlying disease that causes chronic kidney failure.
"
"You will need to give a detailed history of your dog’s health, the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all of the body systems.
"
"Blood testing and biochemical profiles may reveal azotemia, an accumulation of toxic amounts of nitrogenous waste products (urea) in the blood, waste products that are usually excreted in the urine and voided from the body. This condition is also referred to as uremia. There may also be abnormally higher levels of the phosphate in the blood and abnormally low levels of the calcium in the blood. For definitive diagnosis, your veterinarian will perform measurements of serum PTH concentrations. Moreover, low to normal concentrations of calcium in the blood will help in confirming a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Bone X-rays are also helpful in determining bone density, especially around the teeth.
"
" 
"
"Treating the underlying kidney disease is a major goal of therapy in patients that have been diagnosed with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Abnormally high levels of phosphorous in the blood is treated by using chemicals that bind to the excess phosphorous in the blood, and the diet is controlled to limit phosphorous ingestion by way of food.
"
"To overcome calcitriol deficiency, calcitriol is given to increase calcium levels, but in very small doses that are calculated by your veterinarian based on your dog's specific need.
"
"Depending on the severity of kidney failure, it is very important to check the serum concentrations of calcium, phosphorous and urea nitrogen weekly or monthly. If your dog is receiving calcitriol, you will need to closely monitor the dog, as calcitriol therapy may lead to some untoward symptoms or complications.
"
"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations will also need to be checked on a regular basis. Though renal secondary hyperparathyroidism treatment may slow down overall progression of kidney failure, the long-term prognosis is very poor in these patients.

"In all cases of hyperphosphatemia, the underlying cause must be found and correctly treated to have the best outcome for your dog. 
"
"Bloodwork is recommended at regular intervals in patients that have experienced frequent episodes of hyperphosphatemia or have a disease that causes hyperphosphatemia. Once diagnosed, it can be possible for the condition to be managed at home with medications including oral phosphate binders or phosphate-restricted diets. 
"
"Dogs with acute cases of hyperphosphatemia that occur because of issues like vitamin D toxicity should recover fully after treatment with IV fluid therapy and use of medications for binding the phosphorus and are unlikely to require lifelong, at home management. 
"
"A high phosphorus level in a dog means they have a disease that is interfering with the metabolism of phosphorus in their body, and it is causing phosphate levels to rise in the bloodstream. Diseases that could cause hyperphosphatemia include chronic renal failure (CRF), intoxication, hypoparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and cancer. 
"
"High phosphorus levels and the diseases that cause them can be fatal if left untreated unless they are cases associated with young, growing animals.
"
"Animals that are older with chronic renal failure are the most likely dogs to experience hyperphosphatemia. Juvenile animals are also prone to hyperphosphatemia because of phosphorus’s role in helping with bone growth and development. Cases of juvenile hyperphosphatemia tend to not be concerning for disease.

"Hydrocephalus is abnormal expansion and accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in cavities inside the brain. CSF is the liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord to support and cushion those delicate tissues and also provide nutrients to keep them healthy. CSF is normally produced in cavities in the brain and is eventually absorbed by the body as it performs its essential functions.  
"
"In hydrocephalus, the abnormal buildup of CSF can be due to: 
"
"Increased production of CSF 
"
"Decreased absorption of CSF 
"
"A blockage of CSF within the brain 
"
"This accumulation of fluid creates pressure on the brain. Because the skull prevents the brain to expand, and as a result of the pressure, significant damage to the brain can occur, resulting in behavioral and neurological issues. Possible complications include brain herniation and even death.  
"
"Hydrocephalus is an extremely complex disease that veterinarians and researchers have yet to completely determine the underlying mechanisms behind. However, in general, hydrocephalus is broken down into two major types: congenital and acquired. Dogs with congenital hydrocephalus are born with the condition, while dogs with acquired hydrocephalus are born with normal brains but develop abnormal fluid accumulation over time.  
"
"Hydrocephalus can cause a wide variety of symptoms in dogs depending on the specific cause and area of the brain that’s affected. Some dogs are asymptomatic.  
"
"Symptoms may be acute or gradually progress and can include:  
"
"Difficulty training and decreased awareness or lack of response to stimuli 
"
"Visual deficits, often blindness 
"
"Abnormal gaze (eyes fixed down and away) 
"
"Seizures 
"
"Head pressing 
"
"Large, dome-shaped head, often with congenital hydrocephalus and with open fontanelles (the soft spot on the top of the skull) 
"
"Brain dysfunction 
"
"Abnormal behavior—inappropriate vocalization, over excitability, drowsiness, circling 
"
"Gait abnormalities 
"
"Increased intracranial pressure, often leading to stupor or coma 
"
"Congenital hydrocephalus is one of the most common types of the disease. Congenital means “born with,” but does not necessarily have a genetic cause. There are numerous malformations within the brain that can cause obstruction of the CSF. Common causes of congenital hydrocephalus are: 
"
"Genetic malformation 
"
"Prenatal infection (often due to the parainfluenza virus) 
"
"Exposure to substances that are toxic to a developing fetus 
"
"Brain hemorrhage secondary to a difficult birth 
"
"Prenatal vitamin deficiency 
"
"Unfortunately, veterinarians cannot always determine a cause of congenital hydrocephalus. Veterinarians do, however, commonly diagnose congenital hydrocephalus with other malformations such as:  
"
"An abnormality of the skull and vertebra at the base of the skull creating inadequate space for the brain to function 
"
"An underdeveloped part of the brain called the cerebellum associated with cyst formation and subsequent fluid accumulation 
"
"Abnormal cavities within the spinal cord 
"
"A type of spina bifida 
"
"Certain cysts within the nervous system 
"
"Acquired hydrocephalus results when a previously normal brain develops an obstruction and subsequent dilation with CSF. Causes of acquired hydrocephalus include:  
"
"Tumors 
"
"Infection 
"
"Trauma 
"
"Brain hemorrhage 
"
"Inflammatory brain disease 
"
"A vet may suspect hydrocephalus based on a physical exam alone. The veterinarian will examine the dog’s appearance and interactions with and response to stimuli. A dog with an enlarged dome-like head, open fontanelle (soft spot on the skull), and eyes positioned down and out are often evaluated for hydrocephalus.  
"
"X-Ray 
"
"The vet may take x-rays to view your dog’s skull, and to determine if there are open plates and other signs suggesting hydrocephalus.  
"
"Ultrasound 
"
"If your dog has an open fontanelle, the vet may perform an ultrasound to visualize the dilated chambers within the brain.  
"
"CT and/or MRI 
"
"These imaging tests can provide a definitive diagnosis of hydrocephalus because they provide crucial information about internal brain structure and function that cannot be determined other ways. 
"
"In some instances, the vet may also perform electroencephalography (EEG), which detects electrical activity in the dog’s brain and a cerebrospinal fluid analysis, which measures chemicals in the dog’s spinal fluid.
"
"Treatment of hydrocephalus involves addressing the underlying cause. Not all forms of hydrocephalus return to a “normal” state, but the goal is to stop progression of disease. Age, severity, and severity of symptoms all play a role in developing a treatment plan for a dog with hydrocephalus.  
"
"Medicine to decrease production of cerebral spinal fluid is often the first treatment option, especially in dogs with mild to moderate disease. The most common medicine used to accomplish this are:    
"
"Steroids such as prednisolone and dexamethasone 
"
"Diuretics such as furosemide 
"
"Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole 
"
"In severe cases or those that don’t respond to medications, the vet may suggest neurosurgery as a treatment option. Surgery typically involves implanting a shunt to remove fluid from the brain and relocating it to another location in the body, usually the abdominal cavity. Surgery has a 50% to 90% success rate in animals with hydrocephalus. 
"
"If a dog is having seizures, the vet may administer valium and then prescribe other treatments such as antibiotics, surgery, or steroids, once the dog is stable.  
"
"Long-term medical management of hydrocephalus with steroids and diuretics may lead to Cushing’s disease and electrolyte imbalances. It is important to maintain the recommended follow-up maintenance exams with the vet to closely monitor your dog’s health.  
"
"Dogs who have surgery to place a shunt may require additional procedures to address blockages in the shunt.  
"
"Dogs with mild cases of hydrocephalus may lead normal lives with minimal medical intervention. However, more severe cases can have a poor prognosis as the disease progresses and can eventually lead to brain herniation, seizures, and even death. In general, approximately 50% of the animals respond favorably to treatment, both medical and surgical.  
"
"The prognosis for dogs with hydrocephalus ranges from good to poor, depending on age, location, and severity of symptoms. Approximately 50% of dogs respond well to treatment.
"
"Some forms of hydrocephalus are genetic.
"
"Not all puppies have clinical signs associated with hydrocephalus but once they do have signs it is unlikely they will outgrow or lessen in severity without treatment.
"
"No, but hydrocephalus can be managed with surgery and medication.
"
"Medical management can be very cost-effective and inexpensive. Surgery requires veterinary specialists and can cost between $4,000 to $10,000 for surgery and intensive care before and after.

"If your dog has been diagnosed with hematuria (blood in the urine), this is what you can expect to happen next.
"
"The veterinarian will need to determine what disorder is to blame for your dog’s hematuria. He or she will start with a physical examination and complete health history, often followed by some combination of diagnostic tests. Possibilities include:
"
"Appropriate treatment will depend on the results of these tests and the eventual diagnosis. Some of the more common disorders that cause hematuria in dogs are:
"
"Urinary Tract Infection — Canine urinary tract infections are treated with antibiotics. Sometimes a urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing is necessary to determine what antibiotic will resolve the infection. If the infection occurs in conjunction with struvite bladder stones, a special diet or urinary acidifier will also be necessary to dissolve the stones.
"
"Bladder Stones — Struvite bladder stones can usually be dissolved with a prescription diet or with medications that acidify the urine. Calcium oxalate and other types of bladder stones are best removed via surgery.
"
"Cancer — Cancer of the urinary tract can cause hematuria. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or palliative therapy.
"
"Trauma — Injuries can lead to bleeding within the urinary tract. Rest, pain relief, symptomatic/supportive care (e.g., blood transfusions), and sometimes surgery is necessary if a dog is to recover.
"
"Bleeding Disorders — Conditions that disrupt the normal formation of blood clots can cause hematuria in dogs. Treatment depends on the underlying cause (e.g., Vitamin K for some types of poisonings).
"
"Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH) — Unneutered male dogs are at risk for BPH, which can cause hematuria. Neutering is usually curative.
"
"Dogs who are under treatment for hematuria should be closely monitored and encouraged to eat and drink. When dogs are taking antibiotics for a urinary tract infection, they should take the entire course, even if their condition rapidly returns to normal. Follow your veterinarian’s instructions regarding any other medications that have been prescribed.
"
"Dietary modification is an important part of managing some dogs with hematuria. Feeding canned and/or prescription food and keeping fresh water available at all times are common recommendations.
"
"Ask your veterinarian what the possible side effects are from the medications your dog is taking. Find out when he or she next wants to see your dog for a progress check and whom you should call if an emergency arises outside of your veterinarian’s normal business hours.
"
"Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns about your dog’s condition.

"Hyperkeratosis occurs in dogs when their body is producing too much keratin. Keratin is a type of protein that makes up the skin, hair, and nails in a dog’s body. When dogs have too much keratin it appears as thickened dry calluses on their paw pads.
"
"An overproduction of keratin can also look like furry protrusions on the pads of their feet. Other places that are commonly affected include the bridge of the nose and pressure points where calluses form, like the elbows. Common medical names for this condition include canine hyperkeratosis, nasodigital hyperkeratosis, and hyperkeratosis of dog paws.
"
"Hyperkeratosis is rarely a medical emergency.
"
"However, it can lead to some discomfort when walking if the hardened skin cracks, or if your dog develops a secondary skin infection.
"
"Most dogs with hyperkeratosis can be seen by their veterinarian during normal business hours. If they seem to be comfortable and are otherwise acting normally at home, try to get them to their vet within a couple of weeks of noticing their symptoms, to ensure you’re addressing their hyperkeratosis appropriately.
"
"Thickened, hard skin on the paw pads, nose, or other pressure points
"
"Hairlike projections growing off the paw pads
"
"Cracked, dry skin on the paw pads or nose
"
"Bleeding or cracked paw pads
"
"Lameness (not common)
"
"Hyperkeratosis is common in many breeds of dogs. It’s often diagnosed in brachycephalic breeds. They have short muzzles with a smooshed-like face, and include:
"
"These breeds commonly experience hyperkeratosis on their nose and sometimes their paws.
"
"Outer layers of the skin typically wear off when a dog walks, runs, or rubs their face on their food bowls when eating. These physical characteristics can lead to a buildup of keratin on top of the nose or on the paw pads:
"
"Canine hyperkeratosis is also common in:
"
"Hyperkeratosis may also look like hard hairy skin on the elbows in senior animals. Constant pressure on thin skin, as in over the elbow, can lead to excessive keratin for protection. Since senior pets spend more time lying down and sleeping, it’s common to see hyperkeratosis in dogs aged 8 to 12.
"
"Hyperkeratosis is diagnosed by a veterinarian through a physical exam. If a dog has thickened, excess callused skin on their feet, nose, or elbows, they are likely affected by hyperkeratosis, especially if they are older or a predisposed breed.
"
"While most cases are due to genetics or age-related callus formation, this condition can sometimes be a sign of an underlying condition.
"
"Your vet may want to run some baseline tests to ensure that your dog is free from other diseases that could be causing the excess keratin. There are several autoimmune, hormonal, viral, and nutritional diseases that can cause symptoms like hyperkeratosis.
"
"Pemphigus foliaceus, lupus erythematosus, Cushing’s disease, canine distemper virus, and a zinc deficiency are all health issues that can lead to hardening and thickening of the skin on a dog’s paw pads. These issues need to be ruled out before a diagnosis can be made.
"
"Bloodwork, a urinalysis, cytology, or a skin biopsy may be recommended depending on what symptoms your dog may be experiencing. Let your vet know if your dog is displaying any other signs of illness.
"
"Canine hyperkeratosis is not curable, but it can be managed. Treatment is often aimed at softening the hard thickened skin.
"
"Treatment may not be required in dogs that have thickened skin or hairlike projections on their paw pads, nose, or elbows. If they are comfortable and otherwise acting normally without any signs of secondary skin infections, a treatment from their vet isn't needed.
"
"Dogs with more severe symptoms may need to have some of the affected skin taken off, or they may need antibiotics like cephalexin, Clavamox, or cefpodoxime for secondary skin infections. Temporary bandages may be used on the feet after the callused skin is shaved off and ointment is applied.
"
"The severity of your dog’s condition determines how much treatment is needed to keep them comfortable.
"
"Most dogs affected by hyperkeratosis live long, high-quality lives. While this condition typically doesn’t go away, some dogs may not be bothered by the extra hardened skin and require very little supportive care.
"
"Hyperkeratosis of the paws or nose is usually treated with topical products. Your vet may recommend one of the following to help keep your pup’s skin supple:
"
"Some pets benefit from the skin-softening ability of anti-seborrhea shampoos such as Keratolux, DermaBenSs™, and Douxo S3 SEB™.
"
"Provide your pup with deep bedding if their elbows are affected by hyperkeratosis; it can help ease pressure on their thin skin and make them more comfortable.
"
"Canine hyperkeratosis is usually a genetic condition. Because of this, there’s little you can do to prevent it in predisposed dogs.
"
"When it’s not genetic, hyperkeratosis is usually caused by repeat pressure over thin skin, typically in senior pups.
"
"Senior dogs may develop excess calluses. If this occurs, apply a moisturizing balm to their paw pads, nose, and elbows. This can be helpful in keeping their skin soft and free of cracks. Make sure to keep their bed well-cushioned to support their elbows and other areas that are vulnerable to excess keratin.
"
"Most dogs with hyperkeratosis have normal lifespans.
"
"Most dogs affected by hyperkeratosis don’t experience pain—it feels just like calluses to them. Occasionally, the excess tissue can lead to discomfort when it’s severe and on the pads of their feet.

"In recent years, chemicals have been developed to help in the battle against flea infestations. These relatively new pest control products are called insect growth regulators (IGRs) and insect development inhibitors (IDIs). But what exactly are they and how can they help your pets? 
"
"IGRs and IDIs are used in topical spot-on products, oral medications, injectable drugs, and in-home foggers and sprays. They do not kill adult fleas like other flea control products. They work in different ways to break the flea life cycle, by inhibiting growth and preventing fleas from developing into adults that will continue to lay eggs. In the face of a major flea infestation, an adulticide chemical will also be required to kill the adult fleas, bringing the situation under control and making the pet (and you) more comfortable.
"
"More importantly, these pest control products are safe to use around pets and people because they work to mimic insect hormones and inhibit certain development processes in insects, which does not affect mammals.
"
"Chemicals called insect growth regulators serve the purpose of mimicking a juvenile growth hormone in the insect’s body. During normal development, the levels of juvenile hormone decrease, allowing the flea larva to molt into the pupal stage. Because IGRs cause insects to be continuously exposed to a version of growth hormone, they never experience the decrease of hormone levels, and they are not able to properly molt. Affected fleas do not immediately die, but they do not reach a reproduction stage, and they die in the immature phase. When flea eggs and larvae are exposed to this kind of chemical, they will die off completely without ever reaching the adult stage. 
"
"Common IGRs found in flea preventive products and household sprays include fenoxycarb, pyriproxyfen, and methoprene. Certain varieties of these chemicals last longer in the environment than others. For example, methoprene is easily broken down in the presence of sunlight, while pyriproxyfen will last much longer in ultraviolet light. Be sure to read all labels carefully to make sure you are getting a pest control product that will work best for your needs, whether you are using it indoors or out.
"
"Chitin is a substance required for insects to develop the hard outer layer that protects them. Without chitin, flea eggs and larvae are unable to form this outer layer, leaving them vulnerable and easy to kill. Insect development inhibitors work to prevent the production of chitin in the insect and halt normal growth.
"
"Generally, IDIs are given to pets via an oral medication, which then deposits in the animal’s body fat. This allows the drug to slowly release and stay in the bloodstream for several weeks. When an adult female flea bites the treated animal, it ingests the IDI in the animal’s blood, which then affects the eggs it eventually lays, preventing further development.
"
"Common IDIs seen on the market today include diflubenzuron and lufenuron. Both of these products are safe to use in mammals.
"
"Because these products do not kill adult fleas, it may still be necessary to provide your pet with other medications that will work in tandem with the IGRs and IDIs to reduce the adult flea populations, such as a spot-on, or shampoo. However, you should check with your veterinarian to be sure the two medications will work together safely before applying them to your pet.

"If you have a pet, you’ve probably heard about tapeworms or had to deal with them before.
"
"Worms can affect a dog’s overall health and cause some seriously nasty gastrointestinal issues. However, tapeworm infestations in dogs are not usually considered dangerous or life-threatening.
"
"Here’s what you need to know about tapeworms in dogs—from what they are and how they spread to how to treat and prevent them.
"
"Tapeworms are just one type of intestinal parasite that can affect dogs.      
"
"These worms are typically flat and segmented, and each segment is called a proglottid. They almost look like a piece of rice to the human eye.
"
"There are several common tapeworm species in the cestode family of worms that can affect dogs, including:

"
"If your dog has been diagnosed with H3N2 influenza, this is what you can expect to happen next.
"
"After your dog has been diagnosed with the flu, your veterinarian will determine whether hospitalization is required. Severely affected dogs may need to stay at the veterinary clinic to receive oxygen therapy, injectable antibiotics, and to be closely monitored for a worsening in their ability to breathe. Some dogs may also receive medications that dilate their airways, thin mucus, or ease their cough.
"
"Nebulization and coupage (breathing humidified air and chest thumping) can also help dogs cough up and eliminate thick secretions that block their airways. Anti-viral medications (e.g., Tamiflu) are generally not recommended since they work best early in the course of the disease, before most dogs are brought to the veterinarian.
"
"Once dogs with H3N2 are stable enough to continue their treatment at home, they can be discharged from the hospital.
"
"Most cases of H3N2 flu in dogs can be treated at home. Supportive care is critical to a dog’s recovery. Dogs should be encouraged to eat, drink, and rest. If your dog is taking oral antibiotics, make sure to follow the instructions written on the label and give the entire course, even if your dog’s condition appears to be back to normal.

"
"The most common species of tapeworms in dogs is Dipylidium caninum.
"
"There are not many obvious symptoms of tapeworm infestation in either puppies or adult dogs. 
"
"Typically, you may notice your dog licking or biting at his anus or scooting along the ground due to an itching sensation. This occurs as the proglottid segments break away from the adult tapeworm in the intestine and migrate through the anal opening. 
"
"When that happens, you may see what looks like a small piece of rice around your dog’s anus or in their poop. You may also notice anal irritation if your dog is scooting excessively.
"
"Your dog might experience weight loss if he is heavily infected, and on occasion, dogs with heavy adult parasite burdens have vomited whole tapeworms that were dislodged during the act of vomiting.
"
"Tapeworm proglottids may often be seen “wiggling” around the anal opening as they exit the intestinal tract. After they dry out, they may resemble dried grains of rice attached to the fur around the anus and under the tail.
"
"The proglottid segments may also be visible on or in freshly passed feces, again resembling grains of white rice or sesame seeds. 
"
"The proglottid packets contain the tapeworm eggs, which are not visible to the naked eye. 
"
"Tapeworm eggs can be seen in fecal samples through a microscope, but their absence in a fecal sample does NOT necessarily mean that the dog is negative for tapeworms, as the expulsion of proglottid packets is unpredictable.
"
"Dogs get tapeworms when they ingest fleas that are infected with the tapeworm larvae. This can happen during grooming if they lick their fur and accidentally eat an infected flea.
"
"The flea is the intermediate host in the cycle of transmission of tapeworms, which means that your dog will not become infected by simply eating poop that contains proglottid packets with fertilized tapeworm eggs.
"
"So that means that your dog can’t get tapeworms from eating cat poop, either, if you have a dog that likes to hang around the litter box.
"
"A dog would need to ingest the flea that is carrying the tapeworm larvae to get tapeworms. To help understand how that works, here is a breakdown of the tapeworm life cycle.
"
"The life cycle of the tapeworm begins after a dog ingests the intermediate host—the adult flea that’s carrying tapeworm larvae.
"
"Once the adult flea has been digested, the tapeworm larvae are released into the dog’s small intestine. They attach to the intestinal wall and mature to adulthood.
"
"As the adult tapeworm continues to grow, the segmented proglottid packets that make up the body of the worm will break off. These packets exit the intestine with the feces or move through the anal orifice and attach to the fur around a dog’s hindquarters and tail.
"
"Egg packets that reach the soil are then ingested by larval fleas. They develop into immature tapeworm larvae as the larval flea also matures to adulthood.
"
"Tapeworms in dogs can be treated with a parasiticide drug called praziquantel.      
"
"This drug is available in both oral and injectable form and is dosed by weight.

"
"Once praziquantel has been administered, it causes the adult tapeworms to detach from the intestinal wall. This allows the tapeworms to be digested as they pass through the dog’s gut.      
"
"As a result, you will usually not see worms passed in the feces after treatment. 
"
"Praziquantel is available in both prescription and over-the-counter preparations. As with any over-the-counter remedy, you should talk to your veterinarian to determine a safe and effective dose before giving any medication at home.
"
"Side effects of praziquantel are not common, but they may include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and loss of appetite.
"
"While finding a remedy for tapeworms without going to vet might be tempting, there are no proven home remedy solutions. Dewormers are inexpensive and offer proven treatment for tapeworms in dogs.
"
"The “home” remedies that people claim to be effective in treating and preventing tapeworm infestation include:
"
"Garlic
"
"Apple cider vinegar
"
"Pumpkin seeds
"
"Turmeric 
"
"Garlic and apple cider vinegar have been touted as natural preventatives that make the normal gut environment “inhospitable” for the immature larvae.      
"
"Pumpkin seeds and coarsely chopped carrots allegedly “treat” tapeworm infestation by physically debriding the attached worms from the lining of the intestine, causing them to pass through the digestive tract and exit with the feces.      
"
"Turmeric has been touted as a gut anti-inflammatory that supposedly promotes gut healing following tapeworm infestation.      
"
"Consult with your veterinarian before attempting to treat your dog with any over-the-counter treatments or home remedies.
"
" Transmission of tapeworm infestation in humans is relatively uncommon, as it would require the human to ingest an infected flea.      
"
"This occurs slightly more often in children, usually in environments where good personal hygiene is not practiced or with heavy flea infestations in the home or yard.
"
"Preventing tapeworms in dogs doesn’t require much effort. Here’s how you can keep your dog free of tapeworms.
"
"The most effective means of preventing tapeworm infestation in dogs is with the regular use of approved flea prevention products.      
"
"There are a number of safe and effective products available by prescription and over the counter in topical and oral form.
"
"Maintaining a regular flea prevention schedule for your dog will significantly reduce the flea population in your home environment and protect your dog against new infestations of fleas if you regularly visit dog parks or other public areas.      
"
"Cleaning up your dog’s feces will also decrease the opportunity for the tapeworm life cycle to be perpetuated in the soil.      
"
"Practicing good personal hygiene (handwashing) and encouraging this behavior in young children will significantly reduce the risk of tapeworm transmission to humans as well.

"Inter-dog aggression, or aggressive behavior between dogs, occurs when a dog is overly aggressive toward dogs in the same household or unfamiliar dogs. This behavior is often considered normal, but some dogs can become excessively aggressive due to many factors.
"
"Inter-dog aggression occurs much more frequently in non-neutered male dogs. Common signs usually start appearing when the dog reaches puberty (between six and nine months old) or becomes socially mature at 18 to 36 months. Generally, inter-dog aggression is more of a problem between dogs of the same gender.
"
"The most common symptoms of inter-dog aggression include growling, biting, lip lifting, snapping, and lunging toward another dog. These behaviors may be accompanied by fearful or submissive body postures and expressions such as crouching, tucking the tail under, licking the lips, and backing away.
"
"Typically, before a severe inter-dog aggression incident in the same household occurs, more discreet signs of social control will become noticeable. One tactic a dog may use is staring and blocking the other dog’s entrance into a room. A specific condition sometimes triggers the aggression, even though the dogs normally get along well.
"
"The causes of this condition vary. A dog may have become overly aggressive because of its past experiences, including abuse and neglect. For example, it may not have socialized with other dogs as a puppy, or it may have had a traumatic encounter with another dog. Dogs rescued from dog fighting operations also tend to exhibit inter-dog aggression more frequently. 
"
"An owner's behavior may also influence a manifestation of the condition (e.g., if an owner shows compassion for a weaker dog by punishing the more dominant dog). Other reasons for aggression are fear, wanting to protect territory and social status, or a painful medical condition. 
"
"There is no official procedure to diagnose inter-dog aggression. Some symptoms are very similar to canine “play” behavior and excited, non-aggressive arousal. Biochemistry, urine analysis, and other laboratory tests usually yield unremarkable results. But if any abnormalities are identified, they may help the veterinarian find an underlying cause for the aggression. 
"
"If a neurological condition is suspected, advanced imaging, like CT or MRI scans, may be necessary to determine whether it is a central nervous system (CNS) disease, or to rule out other underlying neurological conditions.
"
"There is no real cure for inter-dog aggression. Instead, treatment is heavily focused on controlling the problem. Owners must learn how to avoid situations that encourage aggressive behavior in the dog, and to break up fights quickly and safely when they occur. In situations where aggressive behavior is more likely to occur (e.g., walks in the park), the dog must be kept away from potential victims and be under constant control. The owner may also want to train the dog to feel comfortable wearing a protective head halter and basket muzzle.
"
"Behavioral modification plays a crucial role in the treatment of aggression in dogs. Utilizing licensed, professional veterinary trainers is absolutely necessary. The aggressive dog is slowly conditioned to not fear or react to other dogs through a variety of positive reinforcement training techniques.
"
"Unfortunately, some owners cannot control, train, or avoid situations of dog aggression. In these cases, options include re-homing the dog to a situation that better fits their personality. Some dogs may be deemed unsafe to be around other animals, as well as humans. In these cases, humane euthanasia may be the best way to assure everyone's safety and well-being.
"
"There is no specific licensed medication used to treat inter-dog aggression. However, there are many behavioral medications that can help treat anxiety or hyperexcitability, such as Prozac, Xanax, trazodone, acepromazine, and gabapentin. Some of these drugs are used on a daily basis, while others are only used for situational events.
"
"Successful treatment of inter-dog aggression is usually measured by the decrease in severity or frequency of incidents. In addition, the treatment recommendations need to be implemented over the entire life of the dog. Even if aggressive incidents are completely eliminated for a period of time, relapses may occur if the owner does not strictly adhere to the recommendations at all times. Owners with aggressive dogs need to work closely with veterinary behaviorists and veterinarians to meet treatment goals. It takes a lot of time and patience, but many dogs are capable of controlling inter-dog aggression and leading normal, happy lives.

"Horner’s syndrome is a common neurological condition in dogs and is the name for a group of symptoms that affect one or both sides of a dog’s face, involving the eyes, eyelids, ears, and nose. The syndrome is related to a malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary bodily functions like blood pressure, heart rate, saliva and tear production, and gastrointestinal functions.
"
"The autonomic nervous system consists of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The sympathetic system controls “fight or flight” responses, such as increasing heart rate and blood flow to the muscles so the dog can escape from danger quickly. It dilates the pupils and opens the eyelids while dropping the dog’s third eyelid. The third eyelid moves back and forth across the eye’s surface for extra protection and to keep the eye moist.
"
"The parasympathetic system is responsible for the “rest and digest"" functions of the body. It constricts the pupil, lifts the third eyelid, and retracts the globe inward. Both systems consist of a network of nerve fibers that send signals from the brain to the eye.
"
"If the sympathetic nervous system is compromised, for example when the network is damaged the parasympathetic nervous system takes over. This causes symptoms largely associated with parasympathetic functions. In Horner’s syndrome, this causes a constricted pupil, elevation of the third eyelid, retraction of the eye’s globe, and a drooping upper eyelid.
"
"Horner’s syndrome can affect one side of the face (unilateral) or both (bilateral), though bilateral Horner’s syndrome is less common. Symptoms can occur suddenly and typically include:
"
"Constricted pupil
"
"Elevation of the third eyelid
"
"Retraction of the eye’s globe, which may often appear smaller compared to the other eye
"
"Drooping of the upper eyelid
"
"Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used in various forms by many women, including creams, gels, sprays and patches. However, accidental exposure of dogs to these hormone replacement products can cause serious illness. Dogs are easily poisoned by these products.
"
"Hormone replacement products can also be poisoning to cats. If you would like to learn how they affect cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"Symptoms associated with hormone replacement poisoning will vary depending on the sex of the dog.
"
"There is also concern that prolonged exposure to HRT products could cause bone marrow suppression leading to aplastic anemia (a severe blood disease) and possibly mammary tumors (breast cancer.)
"
"Hormone replacement therapies are used in women to replace estrogen and treat symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, mood swings and bone loss. HRT medications are commonly supplied as creams, gels, sprays or patches. Women are often advised to apply the medication to the wrists, inner elbows, or legs.
"
"Dogs typically become exposed by licking the HRT medication from a woman’s skin. They may also be exposed by chewing on or licking discarded patches.
"
"Diagnosis relies on the appearance of expected clinical signs and known (or suspected) exposure to an HRT product. Estrogen levels can also be measured in the blood to confirm the diagnosis, if necessary.
"
"
"
"Symptoms are often reversible by eliminating further exposure to the medication. However, symptoms may take months to resolve completely in some cases.

"Depending on where the nerve damage occurs, other symptoms may appear, including:
"
"Behavioral changes
"
"Weakness or paralysis of the forelimbs
"
"Neurologic deficits such as abnormal paw placement
"
"Cranial nerve abnormalities (abnormal vision tests, difficulty chewing)
"
"Staggering gait (ataxia)
"
"Unequal pupil sizes (anisocoria)
"
"An ear that is warm to the touch
"
"Skin that appears pink, typically on the nose and ear
"
"Any breed or age of dog can be affected by Horner’s syndrome, but it is more commonly seen in dogs aged 5–8 years old and in breeds such as:
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"Golden Retriever
"
"Doberman
"
"Weimaraner
"
"Shetland Sheepdog
"
"Collie
"
"Horner’s syndrome develops when damage occurs anywhere along the path of the sympathetic nervous system (brain to spinal cord to chest to neck to the eyes). In about half of cases, the cause for damage cannot be determined. The most known cause for sympathetic nerve damage is infection of the middle or inner ear. Other causes include:
"
"Vestibular disease
"
"Diabetes mellitus, especially unregulated or poorly managed
"
"Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD)
"
"Ocular disease
"
"Fibrocartilaginous emboli (FCE), or spinal stroke
"
"Blood clot
"
"Infectious disease or abscess formation, either bacterial or fungal causes
"
"Cancer
"
"Injury due to numerous causes (bite wounds, car-related trauma, even from pulling too hard on a leash or forelimbs)
"
"Neurological diseases
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, including both an eye and ear examination. Tests to rule out other conditions may be done, including:
"
"Schirmer Tear Test to measure tear production
"
"Fluorescein eye stain to look for corneal ulcerations and abrasions
"
"Intraocular pressure (IOP) test to measure pressure within the eye
"
"Eye dilation using medicated solution may be performed to measure how long it takes the eye to dilate. Usually, the longer it takes, the higher chance the damage occurred along the sympathetic nervous system pathway. Cytologies and/or cultures of ear debris may be examined to look for infection.
"
"Other tests such as baseline blood work including a complete blood cell count, internal organ screening, and urinalysis are routinely performed to determine any underlying or associated causes such as diabetes mellitus. 
"
"X-rays of the chest and neck may be taken to screen for signs of trauma, a herniated disc, or cancer. A referral to a specialist for advanced imaging procedures (MRI and CT scan) and/or CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) tap with biopsies may be needed. 
"
"There is no specific treatment for Horner’s syndrome other than to treat the underlying cause. Topical application of phenylephrine (a decongestant) is usually prescribed to relieve the symptoms associated with Horner’s syndrome and can be given as needed. Typically, treatment is more of a cosmetic resolution (restoring the dog’s face to a normal appearance) than a true medical one. 
"
"Prognosis varies based on the underlying cause. Because about half of cases have no known cause, there is a good chance that symptoms will resolve on their own after several weeks.  
"
"Managing the syndrome itself is usually not necessary, but it is important to manage the underlying cause if it can be identified. The key is to seek veterinary help promptly when the symptoms appear.
"
"Recovery can take a few weeks or longer, especially if the symptoms are due to nerve injury in the shoulder. For prevention, common-sense approaches will help. These include using a harness leash when walking your dog to avoid excessive pulling, and other steps to prevent your pup from injuring itself. Proactively cleaning a dog’s ears and proper treatment of infections are also preventative measures that can help prevent Horner’s syndrome.
"
"Horner’s syndrome by itself is not life-threatening, but it can be caused by more severe health issues, and prompt veterinary attention should be given if symptoms are noticed.
"
"Horner’s syndrome can resolve completely or partially without therapy. It rarely affects a dog’s quality of life unless the underlying condition is severe.
"
"Fortunately, it is not painful and does not affect eyesight. Horner’s syndrome is more of a cosmetic issue than a true medical one, but any underlying health cause should be treated.

"Tracheal perforation is a loss of the integrity of the tracheal wall, in the form of a hole or rip, allowing leakage of air into the surrounding tissues and creating air pockets under the skin, air collection in the mediastinum (in between the lungs), and potentially air in the sac around the heart, free air in the chest cavity, and air in the most posterior part of the abdominal cavity (pneumoretroperitoneum). This loss of integrity can be caused by a penetrating trauma, trauma from inside the trachea, or blunt neck or chest trauma.
"
"The severity of tracheal perforation ranges from a small perforation to complete tracheal avulsion (tearing away of the trachea). In dogs with complete avulsion, the mediastinal tissues can help to maintain the airways.
"
"The following signs may occur immediately after injury or up to a week later:
"
"Penetrating cervical (neck) wounds:
"
"Perforation by a veterinarian (iatrogenic):
"
"Blunt trauma can cause intrathoracic tracheal avulsion:
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. An arterial blood gas analysis may also be done to check oxygenation of blood. A pulse oximetry measurement may show less than normal (or even low) oxygen saturation.
"
"Side view X-rays of the neck and chest are essential for diagnosis. Air pockets under the skin, air collection in the mediastinum, free air in the chest cavity, and potentially air in the sac around the heart will be seen with tracheal perforation. In cases of tracheal avulsion, the site of disruption may be visible. Abdominal X-rays may show a pneumoretroperitoneum -- air that has escaped into the space behind the lining of the stomach (peritoneum).
"
"An examination of the interior walls of the trachea can be done by tracheoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of tracheal perforation and to estimate its severity. False-negative examinations can sometimes occur.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor healing of the surgical incisions if surgery was indicated.  Dogs that suffer from an avulsed trachea (one that has been torn away) and do not receive surgery may suffer sudden death. In fact, even with surgery, an animal with a repaired avulsed trachea  have a guarded prognosis.
"
"Call your veterinarian immediately if signs of redness, oozing or swelling are noted at the surgical incision site. The veterinarian should also be called immediately, on an emergency basis, if your dog begins to have difficulty breathing.

"Pet parents of large-breed dogs fear the words “hip dysplasia,” but it can happen to dogs of any size.
"
"So, what exactly is hip dysplasia, and why is it such a concern for pet parents? Here’s everything you need to know about hip dysplasia in dogs—from signs and symptoms to treatments and care.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Hip dysplasia is a condition that occurs during the growth stage in dogs. It results in the loosening of the hip joint, which causes dysfunction and pain.
"
"Histiocytomas in dogs are small skin growths that occur most commonly in young dogs under 3 years of age. These benign growths appear suddenly—pet owners will often say overnight—but histiocytomas generally take 1-4 weeks to sprout.
"
"Histiocytomas can occur anywhere on a dog’s body, but they usually show up on the front half, particularly the head and the ears. They are especially common in Boxers and Dachshunds, and they account for almost 1/5 of canine skin tumors.
"
"Histiocytomas in dogs typically have no symptoms other than the sudden eruption of a domed pink growth on the skin. These growths are neither painful nor itchy in most cases, although both symptoms are possible.
"
"In rare cases, nearby lymph nodes can become swollen. Histiocytomas located near a dog’s eye may cause irritation, leading to eye redness and discharge.
"
"Histiocytomas are a type of benign tumor on dogs. Tumors occur when cells multiply in an unregulated fashion. In the case of histiocytomas, the cell that’s responsible is the Langerhans cell, which is a part of the skin’s immune system.
"
"Genetic factors most likely cause these cells to overmultiply, rather than environmental factors associated with other tumors, like radiation or pet owners who smoke.
"
"Often, veterinarians make an initial diagnosis of histiocytoma in dogs based on:
"
"The appearance of the growth
"
"The location of the growth
"
"The dog’s breed and age
"
"A definitive diagnosis requires microscopic testing, typically through a needle biopsy of the growth.
"
"In most cases, histiocytomas in dogs require no treatment, especially if your dog does not experience discomfort. Since we expect histiocytomas to disappear in less than 3 months, growths that last longer are surgically removed and tested to confirm the tumor type.
"
"Your veterinarian might also recommend the removal of a histiocytoma that grows too rapidly or becomes infected. These growths can be frozen off with cryotherapy if the growth occurs on a part of the dog’s body where surgery is difficult, like their feet or eyelids.
"
"As the dog grows, the cartilage and bone of the hip begin to wear down. Over time, this causes arthritis, muscle atrophy, and limited mobility.
"
"It most commonly affects large-breed dogs, and research shows that it is hereditary.
"
"
"
"Although hip dysplasia in dogs may sometimes go undetected, common signs include:
"
"Chronic or occasional lameness
"
"Limping with no previous trauma or injury
"
"Cracking and popping sounds from joints
"
"“Bunny hopping” when running
"
"Having trouble standing
"
"Abnormal sitting positions
"
"Having trouble getting on and off furniture, going upstairs, or jumping into cars
"
"Dogs can be very stoic and may not show all of these clinical symptoms. However, this condition is very painful, regardless of whether your dog has symptoms.
"
"German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers are the most commonly affected breeds, but any large and giant breed dogs are at risk for canine hip dysplasia.
"
"If you have a large or giant-breed dog, set up monthly checkups between 8 weeks and 10 months of age to help determine if surgical options are needed.
"
"Early diagnosis of the disease can decrease or even prevent the long-term arthritis that is caused by hip dysplasia in dogs. There are several options for treating canine hip dysplasia, including a few surgical options as well as managing the condition through medications. 
"
"Your vet will consider many factors before recommending the proper treatment for your dog. Your pet should have a complete orthopedic evaluation before determining if surgery or medical management is right for you.
"
"There are many factors to consider before choosing a surgical option. In many cases, surgical intervention has a good prognosis and can return dogs to normal function for a normal life.
"
"Prior to 18 weeks of age, dogs can have a joint-saving procedure called juvenile pubic symphysiodesis. Dogs younger than 10 months can have a procedure called a triple pelvic osteotomy.
"
"For adult dogs that are skeletally mature and have increased joint pain and limited mobility, the most common procedures are total hip replacements and femoral head osteotomies.
"
"Talk to your primary care veterinarian or a board-certified veterinary surgeon to determine the best options for your pet.
"
"Surgery can eliminate pain that sometimes even life-long medical management cannot. It may decrease the risk and cost of lifelong medications, and sometimes, in the long run, it can end up being the more affordable option.
"
"The cost of surgery varies tremendously and is based on many factors, such as:
"
"Procedure type
"
"Location
"
"Your dog’s age, size, breed, and pre-existing conditions
"
"When histiocytomas require surgical removal, your dog’s recovery will be like that of most minor surgeries.
"
"Avoid bathing your dog or allowing vigorous activity until the incision heals, typically within 2 weeks.
"
"An e-collar (also known as a cone) or surgical suit may be required to prevent your dog from licking the incision. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed for pain relief.
"
"As with most aspects of veterinary medicine, costs can vary dramatically depending on your location. Rural areas tend to be cheaper, whereas urban areas are typically more expensive.
"
"Fortunately, histiocytomas in dogs can be easily removed by most general practitioners and do not require referral to a specialist in most cases. Talk to your veterinarian for more specific information about the treatment costs and options in your area.
"
"Histiocytomas in dogs are rarely lethal or even painful. However, a very rare disease called Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) causes hundreds of these growths to erupt all over the body, even in the mouth. Dogs with this condition are often euthanized due to poor quality of life.
"
"In most cases, histiocytomas in dogs go away on their own without any treatment. Treatment is warranted when a growth does not resolve itself within 3 months.
"
"No, these growths cannot be popped. Do not attempt to pop any growth or bump that you find on your dog. Instead, call your veterinarian.

"
"To give an example of how much variation there is in cost, some insurance claims for total hip replacements can range from $1,500–$7,000.
"
"But if you compare this to the cost of medical management, which includes pain medications and joint supplements, surgery can end up being much less expensive over time, and could be more effective.
"
"For example, for a dog that lives 10 years that shows signs at age 2, you might spend $4,800–$19,200 over their lifetime for medications to manage the condition:
"
"$50–$200: Cost of medications per month (Healthy Paws Pet Insurance estimate)
"
"$50 x 12 = $600 per year / $600 x 8 years = $4,800
"
"$200 x 12 = $2,400 per year / $2,400 x 8 years = $19,200
"
"This cost does not even include any prescription joint health diets that might be recommended.
"
"Medical management consists of following a multimodal approach to pain management while maintaining joint and muscle health.
"
"Oral joint supplements commonly include ingredients like omega fatty acids, glucosamine, methylsulfonylmethane and chondroitin.
"
"Injectable therapies such as polysulfated glycosaminoglycan injections can also help with joint health.
"
"You can also speak with your primary care veterinarian about a prescription dog food for joint health that can replace daily joint health supplements. Some of these options include:
"
"Hill’s Prescription Diet j/d Joint Care dry dog food
"
"Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Diets JM Joint Mobility dry dog food
"
"Royal Canin Large Breed Joint Care dry dog food
"
"Royal Canin Mobility Support Large Breed dry dog food
"
"Depending on your dog’s pain level, prescription pain medications (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are commonly used to decrease inflammation, which is major cause of pain.
"

"With proper surgical and medical management, a dog with hip dysplasia can live a normal, healthy life.
"
"Your dog should see your veterinarian every six months for a physical examination to ensure joint health and promote muscle strength and mobility.
"
"At this time, there is no known way to prevent hip dysplasia in dogs. It appears to be a hereditary condition, and many dogs, especially large and giant breeds, are born with it.
"
"It’s recommended to start joint supplements for high-risk dogs as early as 3 months of age to ensure good joint health and protect the cartilage of the joints.
"
"You should also work with your vet to make sure that you keep your dog at a healthy weight. Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the amount of stress on a dog’s joints.

"Proteinuria means there is excess protein in your dog’s urine. Although dogs usually have a small amount of protein in their urine, too much protein can be a sign of an underlying condition.
"
"The most important condition associated with proteinuria in dogs is kidney disease, but it can also be caused by infections, inflammation or bleeding along the urinary tract, tumors, high blood pressure, and other conditions. In many cases of proteinuria that are not connected to kidney disease, the condition will resolve as soon as the underlying condition is treated.
"
"Proteinuria caused by kidney disease is a sign that your dog’s kidneys aren’t functioning properly. Kidneys are normally responsible for filtering waste from the bloodstream and balancing levels of certain nutrients.
"
"In dogs with kidney disease, however, a filtering structure in the kidney called the glomerulus is not working as it should. This allows proteins that would normally be kept in the blood to spill over into the urine, where they can be detected by your dog’s vet.
"
"Proteinuria itself is not a disease—instead, it’s a sign there is an underlying condition that needs attention.
"
"The symptoms of canine proteinuria depend on the underlying condition that’s causing it. In many cases, dogs with proteinuria won’t show any symptoms at all, and the condition will be discovered during a routine urinalysis at the vet’s office.
"
"Proteinuria in dogs can be a sign of serious kidney disease, so if you see signs like lethargy or notice that your dog is drinking a lot more, you should seek out emergency veterinarian care as soon as possible.
"
"Proteinuria in dogs may also be associated with any of the following:
"
"Edema (swelling) in your dog’s legs, lower chest, or abdomen. You may see pitting edema, where a dimple remains in the swollen area after you press it.
"
"Difficulty breathing due to fluid in your dog’s chest (pleural effusion) or abdomen (known as ascites or peritoneal effusion).
"
"Blood clots. Symptoms associated with blood clots include difficulty breathing, painful limbs, vomiting, diarrhea, or collapse. The exact symptoms depend on where the blood clot is located. If your dog shows any signs that may be caused by a blood clot, they need immediate emergency care.  
"
"The causes of proteinuria include many issues that can occur anywhere along your dog’s urinary tract, including kidney disease.
"
"Hemolysis (when blood cells burst and release hemoglobin protein into the blood)
"
"Rhabdomyolysis (when muscle cells break down and release muscle protein into the blood; this can be caused by strenuous exercise, fever, or seizures)
"
"Infections (infection of the bladder, urethra, or ureter; genital infections; Lyme disease; anaplasmosis; ehrlichiosis; heartworm disease; dental disease; bacterial skin disease; endocarditis [infection on a heart valve]; Leishmaniasis)
"
"Cancers (lymphoma, mast cell tumor, multiple myeloma, transitional cell carcinoma [cancer of the urinary tract], histiocytic sarcoma)
"
"Inflammation caused by conditions like pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas), inflammatory bowel disease, and arthritis
"
"Kidney issues (injury, failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cancer of the kidney)
"
"Fanconi syndrome (abnormal functioning of tubules in the kidneys)
"
"Systemic lupus erythematosus
"
"High blood pressure
"
"Cushing’s disease (hyperadrenocorticism)
"
"Diabetes mellitus

"
"Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection more commonly seen in cats, but it can also be found in dogs. Dogs under 4 years of age are most commonly affected. Predisposed breeds include the Brittany, Pointer, Weimaraner, and other working dogs.
"
"The fungus that causes histoplasmosis in dogs, Histoplasma capsulatum, can be found anywhere in the world, but it’s especially common in the major river valleys of North and South America.
"
"The infection is normally contracted after the dog inhales the organisms, often from the droppings of birds or bats. Ingesting the fungus by eating bird and bat poop or rotting wood is another method of transmission, although this is theoretical and has not been documented.
"
"Symptoms of histoplasmosis in dogs emerge about 2-3 weeks after infection and can vary widely depending on which organs the fungus infects.
"
"Because H. capsulatum, the fungus causing the disease, spreads to the gastrointestinal tract of dogs so often, the most common symptoms are gastrointestinal, including:
"
"Straining to poop
"
"Producing diarrhea with small amounts of blood or mucus
"
"As with dogs who develop certain types of metastatic cancer, other symptoms may be vague at first:
"
"Vomiting
"
"Appetite loss
"
"Weight loss
"
"Lethargy
"
"High blood viscosity, a thickening of the blood, typically results from markedly high concentration of blood plasma proteins, although it can also result (rarely) from an extremely high red blood cell count. It is most frequently seen as a paraneoplastic syndrome (the consequence of the presence of cancer in the body), and is often associated with multiple myeloma (a cancer of the plasma cell) and other lymphoid tumors or leukemias.
"
"The clinical signs that are associated with hyperviscosity are caused by reduced blood flow through smaller vessels, high plasma volume, and associated coagulopathy (a defect in the body's mechanism for blood clotting). There are no gender or breed predilections, and it is more common in older dogs.
"
"Hyperviscosity is a syndrome, not a final diagnosis; however, your veterinarian will want to know what accounts for the symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your doctor will be specifically looking at total plasma protein count and evidence of blood disorders. Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, your veterinarian will work out a treatment plan.
"
"
"
"Generally, dogs that present with this disease are treated as inpatients. It will be the underlying disease that will be the focus of the treatment. The total treatment plan will be based upon whether the symptoms are being caused by cancer or by an inflammatory condition.
"
"Even after you take your dog home, your veterinarian will want to monitor your dog's serum or plasma proteins frequently to mark the effectiveness of the treatment. Follow-up blood tests will also be conducted, along with urinalyses from time to time, to determine how well your dog is dealing with its disease.

"Azotemia is defined as an excess level of nitrogen-based substances compounds such as urea, creatinine, and other body waste compounds in the blood.
"
"Azotemia is defined as an excess level of nitrogen-based substances compounds such as urea, creatinine, and other body waste compounds in the blood. It can be caused by higher than normal production of nitrogen-containing substances (with high protein diet or gastrointestinal bleeding), improper filtration in the kidneys (kidney disease), or reabsorption of urine back to bloodstream.
"
"Uremia, meanwhile, also leads to an accumulation of waste products in the blood, but is due to improper excretion of the waste products through the urine because of abnormal kidney function.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). The CBC results may confirm nonregenerative anemia, which is common in dogs with chronic kidney disease and failure. Hemoconcentration may also occur in some dogs with azotemia, whereby the blood thickens due to a decrease of fluid content.
"
"Along with identifying abnormally high concentrations of urea, creatinine, and other nitrogen-based compounds in the blood, a biochemistry test may reveal high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). The urinalysis, meanwhile, may reveal changes in urine specific gravity (a urinalysis parameter commonly used in the evaluation of kidney function) and abnormally high concentrations of protein in the urine.

"The most common test to detect proteinuria in dogs is a routine urinalysis. In this test, urine is collected from your dog and assessed by a lab or in a veterinarian’s office.
"
"If high levels of protein are detected in your dog’s urine, your vet will recommend follow-up testing with a second test called a urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR). The UPCR test is considered the gold standard test to measure protein levels in dogs. It will likely be conducted along with other tests to measure your dog’s kidney health. During the UPCR test, urine will be collected from your dog and analyzed in a lab to detect the exact levels of protein in the urine. This helps your vet identify what’s causing the condition.
"
"If a UPCR shows significant proteinuria (a value greater than 0.5), your vet should confirm it by testing two additional samples of urine taken directly from your dog’s bladder with a needle. Additional testing is recommended because proteinuria in dogs can be temporary and may not require treatment.
"
"A urine culture may need to be ordered to determine if a urinary tract infection is present, since a urinalysis can miss a urinary tract infection. A urine culture is the best way diagnose or rule out an infection, especially if a dog has proteinuria and is having symptoms that would support an infection.
"
"Proteinuria itself is not a condition, but it may indicate a more serious underlying health problem.
"
"If your dog has proteinuria, your vet will first identify the underlying cause. This will likely involve additional tests, along with a detailed history of your dog’s health and any changes in their behavior. They may also prescribe medications to prevent blood clots, such as a very low dose of aspirin or clopidogrel, a blood thinner.
"
"Once the underlying cause has been discovered, your vet can develop a treatment plan. Some of the conditions and related treatments that are linked to proteinuria include:
"
"Proteinuria is found in dogs with kidney disease, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and sometimes acute kidney failure. If your dog is diagnosed with kidney disease, your vet will develop a treatment plan to relieve symptoms and restore your animal’s quality of life as much as possible.
"
"Treating kidney disease in dogs can be complex and difficult, but it usually involves regular testing to monitor kidney function and medications that reduce the pressure on the kidneys and help them function better.
"
"Common medications include high blood pressure medications (see below) and possibly, diuretics such as furosemide or spironolactone, if edema is present. These medications reduce the amount of swelling or fluid in your dog’s chest or abdomen. Your dog may also be prescribed a special diet with low sodium, low protein, and omega-3 fatty acids.
"
"Infections causing proteinuria, including urinary tract infections, are often treated with antibiotics. The proteinuria often goes away after successful treatment.
"
"Elevated blood pressure can cause proteinuria in dogs by forcing protein into the urine in the kidneys. Common medications used to treat high blood pressure in dogs include amlodipine and telmisartan. Your vet may also prescribe ACE inhibitor medications including enalapril or benazepril.
"
"Multiple myelomas are tumors that produce antibodies. They also produce special Bence-Jones proteins that are small enough to pass through the kidney’s filter and into the urine. These proteins cause proteinuria and can damage the kidney. A special Bence-Jones protein test can detect these proteins if your veterinarian suspects your dog has multiple myeloma.
"
"Resolving proteinuria means treating the underlying condition. It’s best to detect proteinuria as early as possible so your vet can figure out what’s causing it and develop a treatment plan. In some cases, such as lower urinary tract infection, the condition can be treated relatively easily and the proteinuria will go away.
"
"Fever
"
"As the disease progresses, organ-specific symptoms emerge. Dogs with a heavy fungal burden in their lungs may experience:
"
"Coughing
"
"Rapid breathing
"
"Nasal discharge
"
"Jaundice (yellow skin), if the liver is affected
"
"Swollen lymph nodes
"
"Less commonly, the infection spreads to the eyes, bones, and skin, where symptoms can occur including:
"
"Blindness
"
"Limping
"
"Swollen joints
"
"Strange, unexplained skin lesions, wounds, or oozing nodules
"
"By definition, histoplasmosis in dogs is caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum (also known as H. capsulatum).
"
"Eating fungal spores in bat feces (guano) is the classic source of the infection, although the fungus can also be transmitted when dogs eat bird droppings and rotting wood, among other sources. These spores then infect a dog’s intestines.
"
"In dogs, the gastrointestinal tract is the most common site of spread, but other organs are often affected as well, including the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, eyes, joints, bones, and skin.
"
"Dogs can also inhale the spores, which then go into the lungs. Once inside the lungs, the fungus multiplies. Sometimes the infection remains in the respiratory tract, where it may or may not cause symptoms. However, the fungus commonly spreads or “disseminates” to other organs, behaving eerily like metastatic cancer.
"
"Because the symptoms can be so vague, and because the infection is uncommon in many parts of the United States, diagnosis of histoplasmosis in dogs is challenging.
"
"When presented with a sick animal with no obvious underlying cause, veterinarians often run baseline diagnostics.
"
"This set of general tests analyzes blood and urine to measure things like organ function, electrolyte levels, and cell counts. While these tests do not always give a clear-cut diagnosis, they are useful in narrowing down the list of possibilities.
"
"Dogs with histoplasmosis will show anemia (low red blood cells) and low platelet counts on these tests, as well as low protein and increased calcium, blood sugar, and liver values.
"
"Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound are two other valuable tools often used by veterinarians to diagnose azotemia and uremia. They can help in determining the presence of urinary obstructions and the size and structure of the kidneys -- smaller kidneys are commonly found in dogs with chronic kidney disease, while larger kidneys are associated with acute kidney failure or obstruction.
"
"In some dogs, a kidney tissue sample will be collected to confirm the diagnosis of kidney disease and also to eliminate the possibility of other acute or chronic kidney diseases that may be present.
"
"  
"
"
"
"The type of treatment recommended by your veterinarian will depend on the underlying cause of the diseases, though the ultimate goal is to halt the primary disease, whether it be azotemia or uremia. In the case of urinary obstruction(s), for example, your veterinarian will try to relieve the obstruction to allow normal passage of urine. In addition, if the dog is dehydrated, intravenous fluids will be administered to stabilize the animal and rectify electrolyte deficits.
"
"The overall prognosis of this disease depends on the level of kidney damage, acute or chronic states of kidney disease, and treatment.  However, as most drugs are excreted through kidneys, dogs with kidney disease or failure require extra care for selection of proper medications to avoid further damage to kidneys. Don’t give any drug to your dog without prior consultation with your veterinarian. Moreover, don’t change the brand or dose of the drug prescribed by your veterinarian without prior consultation.
"
"You’ll need to monitor the urine output of your dog at home and in some patients the owners need to properly record the urine output. This record of urine output will help your veterinarian to determine the progression of the disease and overall performance of kidneys with current therapy. Your veterinarian may repeat the laboratory tests to measure the level urea and creatinine concentrations 24 hours after starting intravenous fluids.

"Chronic causes of proteinuria, such as inflammatory bowel disease, Cushing’s disease, or diabetes mellitus, may require long-term treatment. During treatment, your vet will try to stabilize the disease and prevent long-term kidney damage.
"
"Dogs diagnosed with severe kidney disease, such as severe inherited kidney disorder, cancer in the kidney, or kidney failure, may not be able to stabilize the disease or will only be able to do so for a short time.
"
"Dogs normally have a small amount of protein in their urine. When the vet sees that there are higher-than-normal levels of protein released into your dog’s urine, your veterinarian will perform tests to rule out several possible causes of proteinuria, including kidney disease. Proteinuria should be diagnosed and confirmed by a vet.
"
"Some of the most common causes of damage to a dog’s kidney are infections. Keep your dog up to date on heartworm prevention as well as flea and tick control. Treat skin infections and dental disease early. 
"
"High protein in the urine may indicate an infection, blood in the urine, broken red blood cells, muscle proteins, or albumin in the urine. Sometimes, the protein indicates a problem in the kidney’s glomerulus (filtering apparatus), causing protein loss from the body into the urine. 
"
"This is a measurement of the ratio of urine protein to a substance called urine creatinine in your dog’s blood creatinine. Creatinine is a normal waste product found in the blood. This test is considered the gold standard for measuring proteinuria in dogs. Normal UPCR levels are less than 0.5. This test is often used in conjunction with other kidney tests to measure overall kidney function.

"As with the symptoms, however, these results are not specific to histoplasmosis and can be caused by other diseases.
"
"Diagnostic imaging like X-rays of the chest or ultrasounds of the abdomen may show nodules or masses in the lungs or other organs, similar to metastatic cancer.
"
"Histoplasmosis in dogs could cause organs that may be abnormal in appearance or size. Biopsies or needle aspirates (using a needle to remove cells) of these abnormalities are common ways veterinarians diagnose histoplasmosis.
"
"Your veterinarian may also become suspicious enough of histoplasmosis that she tests for it directly.
"
"The blood tests for histoplasmosis are very reliable but are usually only performed after other tests raise suspicion for the disease, since testing every sick animal for every infectious disease every time is not realistic.
"
"Treatment for histoplasmosis in dogs is focused on long-term antifungal medication to destroy the H. capsulatum organisms.
"
"The goal is to treat until the dog has been symptom-free for at least 1 month. Many dogs require over 6 months of antifungal treatment.
"
"Other medications or therapies may be necessary to manage the symptoms and secondary effects of the disease, like antibiotics for pneumonia or skin infections.
"
"Fluids to correct dehydration, or even feeding tubes for dogs that won’t eat, can help keep the dog comfortable until the antifungal medications can resolve the infection.
"
"Once your dog has a diagnosis of histoplasmosis, your vet will require multiple physical exams to monitor the success of treatment and to look for any new symptoms or problems that may emerge.
"
"Repeated blood and urine tests can make sure the medications are working and are not damaging your dog’s organs.
"
"Once your dog has been symptom-free for at least 1 month after testing negative for H. capsulatum, they should be retested one more time. A negative result on this final test before discontinuing medications will ensure the infection has been fully cleared and minimize the risk of relapse.
"
"Your dog should be tested 3-6 months later to look for relapse.
"
"While direct transmission from pets to people has never been documented, H. capsulatum can certainly infect people on its own.
"
"No. Dogs do not pass this infection to other dogs.
"
"In addition to putting dogs at risk for histoplasmosis, eating bird droppings can also expose dogs to caustic substances like uric acid and bacteria like salmonella, resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, and other health problems.
"
"The best way to minimize your dog’s risk of histoplasmosis is to keep your dog away from potential sources of the fungus, including bird coops and decaying wood.
"
"Yes. Bat poop can carry fungus spores that infect your dog with H. capsulatum.  Don’t allow your dog to go near caves and other places where bats live.
"
"While histoplasmosis is the most common systemic fungal disease in dogs, it is uncommon in general. Histoplasmosis in dogs can be found more often in the Midwest and South than elsewhere in the United States.

"Hookworms—specifically, Ancylostoma caninum, Ancylostoma brasiliense, and Unicinaria stenocephala—are among the most common parasitic infections in dogs, along with roundworms, tapeworms and whipworms. They are a particular cause for alarm because in addition to dogs, they can infect numerous other mammals, including humans.
"
"The parasite gets its name from its bent head and mouthparts, which allow it to “hook” onto the intestinal lining to suck blood or feed on liquefied tissue. Hookworms are found worldwide.
"
"In a recent study conducted in the United States, hookworms were found most recently in the Southeast, where a large proportion of sampled dog parks were infested.
"
"Given the life cycle of the hookworm, most symptoms are Gastrointestinal (GI) related. Your dog may experience black, tarry stools, vomiting, decreased appetite and weight loss. Additionally, because the worms feed on blood, your dog may become anemic and experience lethargy, weakness and pale gums. Skin infections, coughing and pneumonia may also be seen, but are less common.
"
"Unfortunately for pet parents, most mature, healthy dogs infected with only a few worms may not show any symptoms and would need to be determined through testing.
"
"A parasite is an organism that lives on or within another organism called the host. There, it is protected and obtains its nutrients, often to the host’s detriment. The adult hookworm lives in the host’s (GI) tract, specifically the small intestine, and feeds off its blood by latching onto the intestines. It mates and reproduces within the GI tract, and the female sheds its eggs into the host’s fecal matter. Once deposited onto the ground/soil, the eggs hatch, go through several developmental stages, and go on to infect others by way of:
"
"Penetrating the skin of an unsuspecting host, usually through the feet (most commonly seen in humans and called cutaneous larval migrans or clinically referred to as a creeping eruption.)
"
"Ingested either from contaminated soil, other animals’ feces, or eating prey
"
"Once inside the host, the hookworm migrates through the tissues to the lungs. It then can be coughed up, re-swallowed and take another trip through the small intestine to reproduce and continue its lifecycle.
"
"During their migration throughout the body, hookworms can become encysted. This means that they enter a dormant stage and remain inactive for some time, only to periodically “wake up” to begin a destructive cycle once again.  One of these wake-up times includes a dog’s pregnancy, when the worms migrate to the mammary glands and are then ingested by the pups. Hookworms can also pass to the pups through the placenta.
"
" 
"
"Most dogs are diagnosed through the examination of feces in a test called a fecal flotation with centrifugation. This is a test that is often conducted bedside in an animal hospital. The feces are first mixed with a chemical and spun down, after which it’s examined under a microscope to look for the presence of the hookworm’s characteristic oval eggs.
"
"The greater the amount of feces examined, the greater likelihood of detection.
"
"Treatment of hookworm infections in dogs is straightforward. Deworming medications, such as Fenbendazole, Pyrantel, Moxidectin, and Milbemycin are often the treatments of choice, and a second dose is usually administered a few weeks later. Most of these medications are inexpensive.
"
"However, dogs suffering from significant anemia and/or secondary complications, such as pneumonia, will most likely require more extensive therapies, such as:
"
"Blood transfusion(s)
"
"IV fluids
"
"Feeding tubes
"
"Iron and/or vitamin supplements
"
"Additional medications
"
"High-quality and high-protein diets
"
"It’s important to note that the following are more at risk for developing significant illness from a hookworm infection:
"
"Puppies
"
"Dogs in a crowded environment (shelters, boarding facilities)
"
"Dogs that suffer from any other underlying condition
"
"Fortunately, there are several things you can do as a pet owner to minimize hookworm infections in your dog, including:
"
"Ensure your dog has at least twice-yearly examinations and stool exams by your veterinarian, and more often if you have a puppy.
"
"Provide your dog with a monthly flea and heartworm preventive product that includes a dewormer.
"
"Maintain a sanitary home environment.
"
"Feed your dog good-quality dog food.
"
"Minimize stress in your dog’s life.
"
"Treat any illnesses your dog may have as soon as you notice symptoms.
"
"Restrict access to areas of the yard that may be infected. Hookworm larvae are susceptible to cold temperatures and sunlight and can only live in the soil for a few months. Additionally, you can add borax to the soil, which can be an effective control measure to kill hookworm eggs.
"
"Pick up any feces in the yard (wearing gloves to avoid being infected yourself) to reduce the risk of transmission.
"
"Treat pregnant dogs daily with an approved product during the last trimester and several days into nursing to decrease the transmission from mother to pups.
"
"Hookworms in dogs are contagious to other dogs as well as humans. They are called a zoonotic parasite for this very reason. If your dog has been diagnosed with hookworms, you should take certain precautions to ensure that you don’t also become infected. Preventive measures include:
"
"Wearing gloves when picking up and disposing of feces
"
"Immediately cleaning areas where your dog has defecated
"
"Practicing good hygiene
"
"Not sharing bedding with your dog
"
"Not walking barefoot or sitting on contaminated soil and sand
"
"Consulting with your primary physician if you suspect contracting hookworms from your dog
"
"Hookworms most certainly can kill dogs, with puppies being most at risk, as well as dogs that live mainly outdoors and are not on a routine deworming schedule.
"
"Roundworms, whipworms, tapeworms and hookworms can be seen in your dog’s feces. Hookworms will look like a thin string in your dog’s feces, but you may not be able to seem them even if your dog has hookworms. It’s important to take your dog in for an examination and bring the stool for proper examination.
"
"Unfortunately, many times you won’t know your dog is infected with hookworms. However, routine deworming products, which are often included in your dog’s heartworm prevention, can be given to treat infection. Routine stool examinations can be and should be performed by your veterinarian. The Companion Animal Parasite Council[1] recommends that dogs be tested for intestinal parasites at least four times in the first year of life and at least two times one year thereafter.

"Cholesterol is a fat-like substance found in all cells in the body.
"
"While it has a bad reputation, cholesterol itself is not bad. Some cholesterol is necessary to make certain hormones, utilize certain vitamins, and build new cells. It’s only when a dog has too much cholesterol that it can become a problem.
"
"High cholesterol is often referred to as hyperlipidemia, or too many fats in the bloodstream. This is measured by levels of both triglyceride and cholesterol, different types of fats that circulate in the blood.
"
"A dog’s cholesterol level is considered high when it’s measured outside the normal blood range (120-270 mg/dL).
"
"High cholesterol is common in dogs and not always indicative of a problem. Often, cholesterol and triglyceride levels are just temporarily high after they’ve had a high-fat meal.
"
"Other times, cholesterol may be high because of underlying disease or genetic predisposition.
"
"High cholesterol in dogs is not considered a medical emergency by itself.
"
"However, many conditions that can cause high cholesterol should be addressed by your vet.
"
"Most cases of high cholesterol in dogs show no symptoms and are often found during routine blood tests. However, if symptoms do show, they may include:
"
"White spots on the surface of the eyes
"
"Hair loss
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Loss of appetite
"
"Abdominal pain
"
"Seizures
"
"High cholesterol in dogs can be caused either through an underlying condition or a specific event. This includes:
"
"Eating a high-fat meal—Most often, high cholesterol in dogs is temporary due to a dog eating a fatty meal prior to a blood draw.
"
"If your dog’s cholesterol level is high due to a recent fatty meal, your veterinarian may want to repeat blood work after your dog has fasted for 12 hours.
"
"Hypothyroidism
"
"Diabetes mellitus or Cushing's disease
"
"Pancreatitis
"
"Protein-losing nephropathy (PLN)
"
"Certain medications—Steroids such as prednisone, prednisolone, and triamcinolone are medications that with chronic use can lead to high cholesterol.
"
"Some breeds are genetically predisposed to having high cholesterol. These breeds include:
"
"Miniature Schnauzers
"
"Beagles
"
"Shetland Sheepdogs
"
"Poodles
"
"Doberman Pinschers
"
"Rottweilers
"
"High cholesterol in dogs is diagnosed with a physical exam, blood work, and a urinalysis.
"
"If you are specifically testing your dog’s cholesterol levels, it’s important to avoid feeding them a fatty meal right before their appointment. Ideally, try to withhold food for at least 12 hours before your visit.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend additional lab work when searching for an underlying cause of high cholesterol.
"
"High cholesterol in dogs can’t be cured but it can be managed.
"
"The treatment of high cholesterol in dogs focuses on minimizing fats in your pup’s diet. A low-fat diet that is high in fiber can be helpful to reduce the amount of circulating fats in the bloodstream.
"
"A low-fat diet will probably be recommended for life, as management of high cholesterol is a lifelong commitment. Similarly, limiting high-fat treats, feeding your dog the right amount, and good exercise habits are helpful for your dog to maintain a healthy weight.
"
"If an underlying disease is present, then treatment is primarily geared toward management of the underlying health condition.
"
"High cholesterol is usually a managed condition in dogs, with a combination of a fat-restricted diet and healthy habits.
"
"Restricting fat in the diet is often accomplished with prescription diets that are considerably lower in fat content. Hill’s® i/d Low Fat, Hill’s® w/d, Royal Canin® Gastrointestinal Low Fat, and Purina® EN Gastroenteric Low Fat are all good examples.
"
"Always encourage regular exercise with your dog. Daily long walks are great for fat burning and building muscle tone.
"
"Consider a food puzzle to keep your dog’s mind engaged and slow down intake so that they feel more full while eating. Be sure to observe portion control and avoid feeding table scraps.
"
"If any medications are prescribed by your veterinarian for other underlying medical conditions, follow the instructions. Don’t skip follow-up appointments, as they are helpful in adjusting the medication and finding the best routine for your dog to stay healthy.
"
"Some dogs who have high cholesterol may benefit from a fish oil supplement such as Nordic Naturals® Omega-3 Pet™ Soft Gels. While fish oil is a type of fat, it is primarily composed of omega-3 fatty acids, which are an example of “good” cholesterol. They may help lower the “bad” cholesterol and overall fat levels in the bloodstream.
"
"Always talk to your veterinarian before giving your dog any supplements.
"
"While genetics play a large part in cholesterol levels in dogs, you can help your dog by helping them to maintain a healthy weight by:
"
"Feeding your pup the recommended amount of food based on their size and age.
"
"Avoiding too many treats or overfeeding during mealtimes.
"
"Not leaving food out all day; many pets will snack because they’re bored.
"
"Not feeding your dog table scraps or other high-fat treats that can alter their cholesterol levels.
"
"Dogs should eat a fat restricted diet to minimize their cholesterol.
"
"While eggs are OK for most healthy dogs’ cholesterol levels, this may not be the case for dogs who have high cholesterol, or hyperlipidemia.
"
"Egg yolks are a source of triglycerides and cholesterol, and are not ideal for dogs with elevated lipids (fats) in their bloodstream.

"Blood pressure is the pressure or amount of force exerted by the blood against the arterial vessel walls, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). It is measured by two numbers:
"
"Systolic: the pressure measured during heart contraction
"
"Diastolic: the pressure measured when the heart relaxes
"
"With every beat of the heart, oxygen-rich blood and nutrients are pumped throughout the body and delivered to the tissues. Higher blood pressure, also called systemic hypertension, means a higher workload, or strain, for the heart and vessels, which will cause damage to the vessels themselves as well as damage to other organs such as the eyes, kidneys, and brain.
"
"It is difficult to measure diastolic blood pressure in dogs—so, systolic blood pressure is often used as a sole criterion for diagnosing high blood pressure. In dogs, a blood pressure less than 150mmHg is considered normal, but a blood pressure of 160mmHg should be investigated as pre-hypertension. Hypertension is diagnosed when the blood pressure is measured consistently above 180mmHg.
"
"In most dogs with high blood pressure, there won’t be noticeable or overt symptoms. However, damage is often caused to the internal organs, causing or worsening kidney disease, and affecting the heart or brain.
"
"Heart murmurs and clot formation may develop, and blindness can occur suddenly with lesions seen in the retina. There may be blood in the eye, in the urine, or out of the nose (epistaxis). Behavioral changes and weakness, as well as seizures, coma, and death can occur.
"
"High blood pressure has three different causes:
"
"Primary, or idiopathic: means the cause is unknown (this cause typically is uncommon in dogs)
"
"Muscular Dystrophy is an inherited, progressive, and non-inflammatory degenerative muscular disease caused by a deficiency of dystrophyin, a muscle-membrane protein. This generalized muscle disorder is primarily seen in newborn dogs or those less than one year old. Male dogs are also more susceptible than females, as are golden retrievers, Irish terriers, Pembroke Welsh corgis, Samoyeds, rottweilers, Belgian shepherds, rat terriers, Brittany spaniels, Labrador retriever, German short-haired pointers, and miniature schnauzers -- all of which often suffer from dystrophin deficiency.
"
"Dystrophin deficiency due to inherited defect.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Creatine kinase enzyme levels may be elevated due to the dystrophin deficiency. Liver enzymes are also elevated in dogs with this disorder.
"
"The most hopeful test for reaching a definitive diagnosis, however, involves taking a muscle biopsy. The muscle tissue sample is sent to a veterinary pathologist to verify abnormal levels of dystrophin.
"
"
"
"No treatment is proven to be effective. Glucocorticosteriods are often given to dogs suffering from non-inflammatory muscular dystrophy, but their effectiveness is variable and their exact mode of action in this disease is still unknown.
"
"Dogs with this disorder are prone to aspiration pneumonia or cardiac disease and must evaluated at regular intervals for such complications. Be vigilant of complications and contact your veterinarian should problems arise. However, symptoms may stabilize after six months in Golden retrievers.
"
"Unfortunately, the overall prognosis is very poor in dogs with non-inflammatory muscular dystrophy. Often, your veterinarian will discourage breeding the animal, due to the genetic nature of the disorder.

"Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia is a congenital defect that affects the communication between the pericardium (double-wall sac containing the heart) and peritoneum (membrane that forms the lining of abdominal cavity). Like other hernias, the protrusion of the septum affects the surrounding area -- in this case, the abdomen.
"
"Symptoms will largely depend on the amount on the amount and nature of abdominal contents herniated. Some common ones include:
"
"Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia occurs at the embryologic stage, and is considered a prenatal defect.
"
" 
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically normal.
"
"Abnormalities visible on X-rays ultimately depend on size and amount of herniated abdominal contents. More advanced techniques, like contrast peritoneography, are also used for a more detailed evaluation, whereby contrast medium (chemical) is given by injection into the peritoneal cavity and then X-rayed at different angles. Another technique commonly employed for confirmation of diagnosis is echocardiography.
"
"
"
"Secondary: often attributed to an underlying disease such as:
"
"Cushing’s, kidney disease
"
"Diabetes
"
"Pheochromocytoma (adrenal tumor)
"
"Diet
"
"Polycythemia (increase in red blood cells)
"
"Side effects of certain medications (phenylpropanolamine and steroids)
"
"Dogs with any of the above conditions should have their blood pressure measured in part to treat the condition itself.
"
"There are some methods to measure a dog’s blood pressure in the hospital, and each has its own limitations and accuracy:
"
"Direct via arterial measurement: Although the most accurate, this method is also the most invasive (and risky), as it requires puncturing an artery. (This method is typically reserved for dogs in critical condition.)
"
"Indirect oscillometer: Readily available and easy to use, this method is less accurate than direct measurement.
"
"Indirect via Doppler: More accurate than the oscillometric method and easy to use, using a Doppler will enable the vet to obtain only a systolic blood pressure reading.
"
"Prior to diagnosing high blood pressure, multiple readings over the course of a few visits or occurrences should be done, to ensure the accuracy and decrease the “white coat effect.” Measuring trends and allowing the dog to acclimate to the machine and testing can be helpful in decreasing stress-related elevations.
"
"In most cases, even when the underlying disease is managed, dogs with high blood pressure will require lifelong medication for treatment. The goals of treatment are to prevent organ damage and symptoms. Usually, a single medication is prescribed, but multiple drugs may be required if the response to a single medication is minimal. Drugs such as enalapril (an ACE-I) or amlodipine (calcium channel blocker) are most common; others like phenoxybenzamine or atenolol (alpha and beta blockers), or even hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide (diuretics) can be used. In emergency settings, drugs like hydralazine and nitroprusside are routinely prescribed. 
 
"
"The good news is that, for some dogs, high blood pressure can be resolved once the underlying disease process is either treated or managed effectively. However, most dogs will require lifelong medication to manage high blood pressure.
"
"Additionally, dogs should be re-examined and their blood pressure measured within a few weeks of starting medication, as the goal of therapy is to obtain a normal blood pressure (&lt;150mmHg). It should be measured again every couple of months thereafter. Follow your veterinarian’s recommended recheck guidelines going forward.
"
"Additional tests such as bloodwork and urine testing may also be recommended at these appointments, which are important to determine any damage to other organs from the disease or side effects of the medication. Your dog probably already has follow-up appointments to manage his other underlying disease.
"
"Desensitizing your dog to having his blood pressure taken can be done at home with practice and patience. Ask your veterinarian to borrow a cuff or purchase one yourself—anything to make the process of reading his blood pressure easier and less stressful will be helpful toward managing his condition.
"
"Decreasing stressful events (for example, exposure to thunderstorms, fireworks, and strangers) can be immensely helpful in maintaining a more stable blood pressure. Salt restriction is often not necessary, but a high salt intake should be avoided. Talk to your veterinarian about possible dietary recommendations.
"
"The timeframe is variable, but with proper care, follow-up, and monitoring, a better prognosis can be afforded when your dog’s blood pressure is adequately controlled. The risks of developing more serious complications are also decreased.

"A dog with abnormally high levels of glucose in the blood is said to have hyperglycemia. A simple carbohydrate sugar that circulates in the blood, glucose is a major source of energy for the body, of which normal levels range between 75-120mg.
"
"Insulin, a hormone that is produced and released by the pancreas into the bloodstream when glucose levels rise, plays a key role in maintaining normal sugar levels. Low levels or absolute deficiency of insulin results in abnormally high blood sugar levels.
"
"Some of the causes for hyperglycemia may be pancreatitis, and the resulting inability to produce insulin; normally occurring hormones, especially in female dogs; diet; and infections of the body (such as teeth, or urinary tract).
"
"Middle aged and older dogs are more at risk for developing hyperglycemia, and it is more common in female dogs than in males. Any breed can be affected, but some smaller breeds appear to be more disposed, including beagles, cairn terriers, dachshunds, miniature poodles and schnauzers.
"
"Clinical symptoms may vary depending on the underlying disease/condition. Your dog may not be showing any serious symptoms, especially those if the increased sugar is thought to be temporary, hormonal, or stress induced hyperglycemia. Some of the more common symptoms include:
"
"Other than high stress situations, harmful drug interactions (such as with heartworm medication), and intake of nutritional solutions containing high glucose, the following are potential causes to hyperglycemia:
"
"Low glucose consumption within the body leading to high blood sugar levels
"
"High glucose production
"
"Physiological causes
"
"Infections
"

"Much like humans, dogs can suffer from hernias. An inguinal hernia is a condition in which the abdominal contents protrude through the inguinal canal or inguinal ring, an opening which occurs in the muscle wall in the groin area.
"
"Inguinal hernia can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of hernia affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"Inguinal hernias may be uncomplicated or complicated. A complicated hernia is one in which contents of the abdominal cavity have passed through the opening and become entrapped.
"
"Symptoms seen with an uncomplicated inguinal hernia are:
"
"Symptoms seen with a complicated inguinal hernia may include:
"
"In dogs, inguinal hernias may be acquired (not present at birth but developing later in life) or congenital (present at birth). Factors which predispose a dog to develop an inguinal hernia include trauma, obesity, and pregnancy.
"
"Most inguinal hernias are uncomplicated and cause no symptoms other than a swelling in the groin area. However, if contents from the abdominal cavity (such as the bladder, a loop of intestines or the uterus) pass through the opening and become entrapped there, the situation can become life-threatening.
"
"Inguinal hernias can usually be diagnosed by finding the swelling caused by the hernia on a physical examination. However, sometimes contrast radiographs (X-rays) or an abdominal ultrasound are needed to determine which abdominal contents, if any, are entrapped.
"
"
"
"Treatment is surgical correction of the opening and replacement of abdominal contents back into the abdomen if necessary.
"
"Because inguinal hernias can be hereditary, dogs with these hernias should not be bred.

"A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your veterinarian will have the blood samples tested immediately for blood sugar levels. In some cases the only abnormal finding will be the raised blood sugar. This is especially true in cases that are linked to temporary conditions, such as stress or hormones. Unless there is some underlying disease/condition present, the blood test results are usually normal.
"
"Urinalysis may reveal higher sugar levels, pus, bacteria, and an excessive number of ketone bodies in the urine, as seen in diabetes mellitus. Low insulin levels accompanied by high blood glucose levels are also indicative of diabetes mellitus. High lipase and amylase enzyme levels indicate inflammation in the pancreas. In some cases higher liver enzyme levels are also present due to fatty deposits in the liver tissue. Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound may provide important information regarding the underlying disease.
"
"More specific tests may be required to diagnose the underlying cause. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms, such as undiagnosed diseases of the pancreas (pancreatitis, amyloidosis). Previous infections may still be present as well, causing a spike in glucose levels. If your dog has had any previous infection in the body, you should tell your veterinarian about them.
"
"  
"
"
"
"As there are number of conditions that can raise blood sugar levels, the treatment depends on correction of the underlying cause. In cases of physiological rise in blood sugar levels, stress will need to be minimized or eliminated.
"
"It is never ideal to attempt decreasing the blood sugar levels abruptly as it may lead to hypoglycemia or lower blood sugar levels. In diabetic patients glucose level fluctuations are common and adjusting the insulin dose or other drugs can help resolve the problem. There are some situations in which glucose levels are high but do not indicate an increase in insulin and can even be worsened by increased insulin doses. Your veterinarian will guide you in determining when to adjust insulin levels.
"
"In case of diabetes, the dog owner’s life-long commitment and compliance is required for proper management of the disease. These animals also require special diets containing less concentrations of sugar. High-protein, low-carbohydrate, low-fat, and high fiber diet is often recommended for these patients. If your dog is diabetic, you will need to strictly follow the treatment guidelines given for your dog to avoid major fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
"
"If insulin has been recommended, it should be injected at the right time and in the right dose. Never change the brand or amount of insulin dosage on your own without prior consultation with your veterinarian.

"A hernia is most likely to occur in puppies less than a year old and is usually inherited (congenital). However, trauma may also bring on an acquired hiatal hernia, and this can occur at any age. A hernia occurs when one part of the body protrudes through a gap or opening into another part. A hiatal hernia, specifically, takes place at the opening of the diaphragm where the food pipe joins the stomach. Part of the stomach pushes through the opening, and a hernia is formed. Although this can occur in any breed or age, and with both genders, there does appear to be a predisposition for male animals, and with Chinese Shar-Pei and English bulldogs more than other breeds.
"
"X-rays may show soft-tissue density in the region of the esophageal opening (hiatus), but they may not reveal lesions. However, an enlarged esophagus can be detected using X-ray imaging. Contrast exams can show the esophagus as it is joined to the stomach and may reveal the abnormalities that are causing the problems. Your doctor can also perform an exam called an esophagoscopy, by which an internal scope is used to detect inflammation, and possibly show the end (terminal) of the esophagus sliding into the thorax.
"
"Diagnosis of hiatal hernia is based on examination and observation of one or more of the following manifestations of the condition:
"
"
"
"Surgical treatment may be necessary if your veterinarian finds the need to close the opening (hiatus), or needs to attach the stomach to the abdominal wall so that it does not protrude further. Antibiotics and therapeutic breathing treatments may be necessary if aspiration pneumonia develops as the result of associated breathing abnormalities. Your veterinarian can prescribe drugs that will promote digestion and increase the tone of the sphincter in the lower esophagus. For example, medications such as cimetidine will decrease the acidity of the reflux, and promote healing of the damaged esophagus tissue.
"
"But, not all hiatal hernias require treatment. Conservative therapy can be successful for controlling symptoms, and feeding small but frequent portions of a low-fat diet may also control symptoms. 
"
"If surgery is required for your dog, you will need to follow through with visits to your veterinarian for after care treatment. This is true even if you are managing the hiatal hernia from home. Aspiration pneumonia is one of the possible long term complications related to a hiatal hernia, so you will need to be watchful for signs of this. If you do see symptoms of pneumonia, you will need to take your dog to the veterinarian immediately, as this is a condition that can quickly progress. Some dogs may have a recurrence of all symptoms, in which case you and your veterinarian will need to go back to square one to rule out other causes and settle on a treatment plan that will work.

"Hepatozoonosis in dogs is an infectious disease caused by a single-cell organism called a protozoan. There are two main types of Hepatozoonosis: Hepatozoon canis, carried by the Brown Dog tick, and Hepatozoon americanum, carried by Gulf Cost ticks.
"
"A dog can become infected by swallowing a contaminated tick or by eating prey animals that are infected by ticks. Dogs that hunt or scavenge on outdoor prey or those that live in areas with high Brown Dog or Gulf Coast tick populations have a higher risk of exposure. In most cases, a dog will show symptoms 4 to 10 weeks after ingesting the tick.       
"
"The disease occurs in the southeast and south-central United States, specifically Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Florida, where the Gulf Coast and Brown Dog ticks are more common.
"
"Hepatozoonosis caused by H. Americanum can be debilitating and eventually fatal within a few months without treatment. Pet parents are not at risk because the disease cannot spread to humans.
"
"Infection with H. canis tends to be less severe, and since these organisms like to live in the immune system (lymph nodes and bone marrow) and blood storage organs (spleen) they tend to have symptoms of enlarged lymph nodes, pale gums, and lethargy. Some pets infected with H. canis have very mild or even unnoticeable symptoms.
"
"With H. americanum infections, symptoms can become debilitating without treatment. Symptoms may include:
"
"Fever
"
"Lethargy
"
"Weight loss
"
"Muscle or bone pain
"
"Muscle loss
"
"Discharge from the eyes
"
"Pet parents may first notice a reluctance to rise, a stiff gait when walking, and lethargy due to fever.  They may notice that the dog become hypersensitive to touch (hyperesthesia) and may scratch or self-mutilate. As the condition worsens, a dog may lose muscle.
"
"Unlike most tick-borne diseases, which are transmitted from a tick bite, hepatozoonosis is transmitted by swallowing an infected tick. Dogs can also acquire the infection by eating a tick-contaminated carcass of a wild animal. Recent studies have also shown that dogs can get the infection from eating a wild animal that has the infection, even if the dog does not eat a tick directly.
"
"Fortunately, this disease cannot be transmitted from dog to dog.    
"
"Diagnosis of hepatozoonosis in dogs starts with a comprehensive history of the dog’s daily routine, geographic location, and recent tick exposure.  Other methods for diagnosis may include:
"
"Physical examination
"
"Complete blood count
"
"Blood chemistry analysis
"
"Urinalysis
"
"X-rays
"
"PCR testing
"
"Muscle biopsy
"
"A veterinarian will look for anemia in the blood, and for high levels of a type of white blood cells called neutrophils. Rarely, the disease-causing protozoan can be seen in your pet’s blood sample. In x-rays, a vet will look for bone lesions. These tests are all used to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as diskospondylitis, meningitis, canine distemper, and polyarthritis (as well as other tick-borne diseases in dogs).
"
"Once these initial tests are done, your veterinarian will likely send out a PCR test to confirm infection. A PCR test looks for the protozoan’s DNA in a dog’s bloodstream. A biopsy of muscle tissue may be necessary to confirm the presence of the protozoan, as this is the primary location for the organism to live.
"
"While there is no long-term cure for hepatozoonosis, treatments can help alleviate the symptoms and increase survival time. Treatments include hydration, assisted feeding of a high-calorie diet, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories to reduce inflammation and pain medication. 
"
"Anti-protozoa medication will likely be prescribed, which can increase lifespan and quality of life. Two  therapy options are commonly used. The most common therapy uses three medications, which together are referred to as TCP:
"
"T for trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (an antibiotic)
"
"C for clindamycin (also an antibiotic)
"
"P for pyrimethamine (an anti-parasitic)
"
"Another therapy options utilizes ponazuril, an anti-parasitic that may be used alone.
"
"Your veterinarian will likely recommend long-term treatment with decoquinate (an anti-parasiticide that can be mixed with food) twice daily for 2 years to reduce chances of symptoms returning.
"
"This therapy does not clear the protozoa completely from the dog’s system, but it reduces their number to lower the inflammation and accompanying symptoms. Relapse of symptoms is likely as remission tends to only last 2-6 months after decoquinate is discontinued. Without treatment, the body becomes debilitated and the muscles waste away, which can lead to death within months. 
"
"With H. canis infection, treatment generally consists of use of an anti-protozoal medication called imidocarb twice monthly for multiple months. Healthy dogs without additional diseases can potentially be cleared of the protozoan with consistent care.
"
"The triple combination therapy is commonly prescribed for 14 days. By this time, if the dog is responding to therapy, movement and activity should improve as pain recedes. Dogs have used decoquinate therapy for years, and the consensus is that the therapy increases survival time and good quality of life.  It is important to mention that dogs with hepatozoonosis cannot be cured, and management of the disease is a lifelong process.
"
"The only effective way to prevent Hepatozoonosis is to prevent your dog from ingesting ticks.  There are many safe and effective tick treatments to ask your veterinarian about that can be administered every 1-3 months.
"
"Other strategies include:
"
"Using year-round tick control on your dog in endemic areas
"
"Preventing your dog from eating prey animals outside where ticks are common
"
"Keeping your house and yard free of ticks (which may require professional pest control assistance)
"
"No, canine hepatozoonosis cannot be spread to humans.

"Hemangiosarcoma is an aggressive form of cancer that develops from blood vessels. It can occur anywhere in the body but most often affects a dog’s spleen, heart, liver, or skin.
"
"Symptoms of hemangiosarcoma vary depending on the body systems involved. Hemangiosarcoma tumors are composed of abnormal blood and blood vessels that are fragile, invasive, and easily ruptured. When a tumor ruptures, it hemorrhages into a body cavity like the chest or abdomen, causing many of the clinical signs associated with hemangiosarcoma.
"
"Hemoabdomen is internal bleeding in the abdomen. Internal bleeding is just what it sounds like—blood loss that happens inside the body.
"
"Bleeding is always scary, but internal bleeding can be terrifying. So many questions need answers fast: How much blood is involved? Where is it coming from, and why? How can it be stopped? Will my dog survive?
"
"The abdomen is the most common place for blood to collect inside the body—around the liver, spleen, stomach, intestines, and other abdominal organs. Blood can also collect in other areas, such as the chest cavity (thorax), in a condition called hemothorax.
"
"Hemoabdomen is something that a vet will discover through a physical examination and diagnostic tests. Although you won’t see it directly, you may be able to notice visible signs of it.
"
"Here’s what you need to know about the signs of hemoabdomen, what causes it, and how it’s treated.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Many of the symptoms associated with internal bleeding are similar to those seen with external bleeding. This is because no matter whether your dog’s blood stays inside their body or makes its way outside, it’s still not in the cardiovascular system where it needs to be. If your dog has a hemoabdomen, you might notice:
"
"Rapid breathing
"
"A faster heart rate than normal
"
"Heatstroke is the most severe condition in a spectrum of heat-related illnesses. The first sign a dog may be developing heat-induced illness is typically heat cramps, characterized by muscle spasms. This is often related to dehydration and electrolyte depletion.
"
"If the dog continues to be exposed to the heat, this will likely progress to heat exhaustion. Heat exhaustion is characterized by fatigue and weakness but may also include vomiting and diarrhea. In the heat exhaustion phase, the pet will likely still have a normal or slightly elevated temperature and dehydration.
"
"The hallmark of the transition from heat exhaustion to heatstroke is central nervous system signs such as disorientation or seizures, an elevated temperature (greater than 104 degrees Fahrenheit), and often, multiple organ dysfunction. Heatstroke results from an inability of the body to cool down. This results in damage to the tissues of the body (inflammation), which leads to decreased blood flow to the organs and can ultimately cause organ damage and failure.
"
"Every system in the body can be affected by heatstroke, but main ones include:
"
"Heart (elevated heart rate)
"
"Central nervous system (disorientation, seizures)
"
"Gastrointestinal tract (vomiting and diarrhea, often bloody)
"
"Kidneys
"
"Liver
"
"Coagulation system (increased risk of bleeding)
"
"Furthermore, heatstroke overpowers the body’s defense mechanisms by damaging heat shock proteins, which are designed to protect the body from stress and heat.  
"
"Hemangiosarcoma typically affects middle-aged to older dogs; but it has also been reported in puppies only a few months old. Some breeds may be predisposed to hemangiosarcoma, including:
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Golden Retrievers
"
"Labrador Retrievers
"
"Boxers
"
"Pit Bulls
"
"Dogs with thin hair coats: Whippets, Greyhounds, Italian Greyhounds, Beagles, English Pointers, Dalmatians, and Basset Hounds
"
"Because of the vascular (lots of blood vessels) nature of hemangiosarcoma, it can cause cancer anywhere in the body. The most common types of hemangiosarcoma are:
"
"Splenic: This is the most common type in dogs. This cancer invades the spleen, an abdominal organ primarily responsible for immune system function, red and white blood cell production, and storage of blood products. When a dog is diagnosed with a splenic tumor, two-thirds of those tumors are malignant or cancerous. Two-thirds of the malignant tumors will be hemangiosarcoma, making it the most common splenic tumor. It is often seen in combination with liver and cardiac hemangiosarcoma.
"
"Cardiac: This cancer typically forms in the right atrium, one of the heart's chambers. It is the most common cancer affecting the heart and the second most common location of hemangiosarcomas.
"
"Cutaneous/subcutaneous (skin): This cancer affects the skin (cutaneous or dermal) and under the skin (subcutaneous).
"
"Other common areas affected by hemangiosarcoma include:
"
"Liver
"
"Lungs
"
"Bone
"
"Kidney
"
"Brain
"
"Oral cavity
"
"Abdomen
"
"Muscle
"
"Clinical signs of hemangiosarcoma vary with the organs involved. A hallmark of hemangiosarcoma is the ability to bleed profusely, primarily because the tumors are made from blood cells and vessels. The tumors are invasive at the primary tissue site but also distantly aggressive, rapidly growing and spreading to other sites in the body.
"
"Symptoms of the three most common types in dogs include:
"
"Splenic hemangiosarcoma: The vascular nature of hemangiosarcoma commonly leads to large, blood-filled tumors within the spleen. The tissue is not healthy and is easily breakable. This damaged organ can rupture, spilling blood into the abdomen and causing acute blood loss. While some dogs can be asymptomatic for a while, pet parents most often notice clinical signs secondary to a ruptured splenic tumor, including:
"
"Pale gums
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Weakness
"
"Mental dullness
"
"Mucous membranes (around the eyes, nose, and mouth) that are pale, blue, muddy, or a brighter pink or red than normal
"
"Skin that is cool to the touch, which is often first noticeable around the ears, feet, and tail
"
"A distended (enlarged) abdomen, although this isn’t always noticeable
"
"Talk to a veterinarian immediately if your dog has any of these symptoms. Call an after-hours emergency clinic if needed. The veterinarian will probably want you to bring your dog in right away, since these signs are often associated with life-threatening health conditions.
"
"This is true whether or not your dog has previously had any internal bleeding. A dog’s condition can very rapidly deteriorate if they are losing a lot of blood.
"
"Many health conditions can cause a hemoabdomen. They can be put into four categories:
"
"Traumatic injuries to the abdomen can lead to internal bleeding. Penetrating wounds (from something entering the body) such as impalements, gunshots, or bite wounds may be obvious when they happen, but some injuries don’t leave much external evidence. Blunt-force trauma like falls, blows, or being hit by a car can cause potentially life-threatening internal bleeding without other obvious injuries.
"
"Tumors (both benign and malignant) affecting the spleen, liver, or other abdominal organs may disrupt blood vessels and cause internal bleeding. The most common non-traumatic cause of a hemoabdomen in dogs is an aggressive type of cancer, hemangiosarcoma, that often involves the spleen. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to know for sure whether a dog has hemangiosarcoma or a different, more treatable type of tumor without surgery and sending a tissue sample to a pathologist to identify.
"
"If your dog has recently had abdominal surgery, it’s possible that blood vessels that were closed off have opened back up and are bleeding. Your dog is losing dangerous amounts of blood if they are developing symptoms associated with a hemoabdomen.
"
"Dogs may start bleeding if their blood coagulation (clotting) system isn’t working normally. Anti-coagulant rodenticide poisonings are a common cause of this. Immune disorders, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), liver disease, and a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)—which can develop secondary to infection, inflammation, or cancer­—may also be to blame. Coagulation disorders can lead to bleeding in multiple sites throughout the body and need to be treated immediately.
"
"When a dog arrives at the veterinary clinic with signs of internal bleeding, the doctor will quickly assess the situation. Dogs that are in critical condition may require intravenous (IV) fluids, transfusions, oxygen therapy, and other treatments before the search for an underlying cause can begin.
"
"During this time, the veterinarian will also ask you questions about your dog’s health history, the signs you’ve been seeing at home, how quickly they developed, if they’ve changed, and whether your dog could have been injured or poisoned.
"
"Diagnostic testing can begin when a dog’s condition is stable. This may include:
"
"A complete blood cell count to check the dog’s red blood cell and platelet levels (platelets help with blood clotting) and to look for signs of infection or inflammation
"
"A blood chemistry panel to measure electrolyte and protein levels in the blood and to monitor organ function
"
"A urinalysis to further check kidney function and to look for infections or blood loss
"
"Blood clotting times to check for coagulation disorders
"
"X-rays of the abdomen and chest to look for signs of bleeding and cancer
"
"Ultrasound of the abdomen to confirm the presence of blood (or other fluids) and to look for tumors
"
"Examining a sample of abdominal fluid
"
"Treatment for hemoabdomen will depend on the condition’s underlying cause.
"
"Heatstroke can occur very quickly and result in death in under an hour, especially if the pet does not have access to shade, water, and rest. This is an absolute emergency, and pet parents should take their dog immediately to the local emergency veterinary hospital if they suspect heatstroke.  
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The signs of heatstroke include:
"
"Excessive panting
"
"Reddened gums/mucous membranes
"
"Tachycardia (fast heart rate)
"
"Dehydration 
"
"Elevated temperature (104 F and above) 
"
"Vomiting (with or without blood) 
"
"Diarrhea (with or without blood)
"
"Disorientation/stumbling
"
"Weakness/collapse
"
"Seizures/death 
"
"There are two classic examples of how a dog develops heatstroke:  
"
"A dog left in the car, even on a relatively cool day: According to a recent study, the temperature inside a car increases by an average of 40 F per hour. This means even if it is only 70 F outside, the inside of the car can easily be greater than 110 F. For this reason, a dog should never be left alone in the car, even with the windows partially open.  
"
"A dog exercising on a hot, humid day: Use extreme caution when exercising your dog on summer days. Dogs can develop heatstroke even when walking for relatively short periods of time. Consider performing outdoor activities early in the morning or late at night and be sure to provide plenty of fresh water.  
"
"Some dogs have a higher risk of developing heatstroke. Dogs with:
"
"Brachycephalic syndrome (meaning short-nosed dogs with flattened faces such as pugs or boxers)
"
"Heart disease
"
"Laryngeal paralysis
"
"Obesity
"
"Tracheal collapse
"
"Older dogs are also at higher risk. However, any dog can develop heatstroke. Dogs are more susceptible to the effects of heat-related illnesses than humans because they are not able to cool themselves by sweating.
"
"The main way dogs cool themselves is by panting causing water to evaporate from their tongue, but this is inefficient, and they can overheat quickly. Heatstroke cases are more commonly seen in Southern states, and in general in areas with higher temperatures and humidity. Heatstroke is becoming a growing danger due to climate change and extreme weather patterns.
"
"Heatstroke is often a diagnosis based on history of heat exposure (being left in the car, exercising), clinical signs, and body temperature greater than 104 F). A complete medical history for any predisposing factors such as heart disease, laryngeal paralysis, and tracheal collapse is also helpful.
"
"If you suspect your dog may be experiencing heatstroke, call your veterinarian or local emergency veterinary hospital immediately. They will likely instruct you on beginning to cool your dog prior to arrival at the hospital. This is extremely important. Cooling your pet prior to arrival at the hospital has been shown to increase their chances of survival from 50% to 80%. The cooling technique is crucial to preventing more damage.
"
"Distended abdomen
"
"Cardiac hemangiosarcoma: This cancer weakens the heart, decreasing the ability to pump blood appropriately. These tumors are also brittle and unstable, causing hemorrhage into the sac around the heart and lungs. As cardiac hemangiosarcoma progresses, pet parents typically notice:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Weakness
"
"Coughing
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Exercise intolerance
"
"Vomiting
"
"Cutaneous/subcutaneous hemangiosarcoma: This type of hemangiosarcoma may appear as a bump, blister, or nodule in or under the skin's surface. Especially when caught early, dogs with these tumors are usually otherwise healthy. With skin hemangiosarcoma, pet parents typically note:
"
"Bruising around the tumor
"
"Bleeding from the tumor
"
"Lethargy, lameness, loss of appetite, weakness, or other abnormalities in dogs with more aggressive or progressed tumors.
"
"Most causes of hemangiosarcoma are not known. It likely has a genetic link, as shown by the predisposed breeds. Skin hemangiosarcoma has been linked to UV exposure, especially in thin, light-coated dogs.
"
"In humans, some forms of chemicals, insecticides, toxins, and radiation have been linked to hemangiosarcoma development. While there aren’t any direct studies in dogs, these factors are also believed to cause hemangiosarcoma in our pets as well.
"
"Veterinarians may suspect hemangiosarcoma based on clinical signs and history. Because hemangiosarcoma can affect any body system, testing and diagnosis is different based on individual cases.
"
"All forms of hemangiosarcoma involve staging, which is a determination of the severity and spread of the disease. Staging will decide available treatment options for pets and develop a general prognosis and expected survival time.
"
"Once a veterinarian suspects hemangiosarcoma, they will typically recommend bloodwork, chest x-rays, an abdominal ultrasound, and a cardiac echocardiogram. Advanced imaging, such as a CT scan or MRI, can help figure out the extent of disease spread.
"
"
Splenic hemangiosarcoma
"
"Veterinarians may diagnose a dog with splenic hemangiosarcoma after an acute collapse episode or weakness after a tumor ruptures. Often, splenic hemangiosarcoma is diagnosed after a veterinarian feels an enlarged spleen or incidentally discovers a mass on the spleen during an x-ray or ultrasound. For a definitive diagnosis, the spleen must be biopsied, and the samples must be evaluated by a pathologist.
"
"Cardiac hemangiosarcoma
"
"Heart tumors are usually diagnosed by an ultrasound of the heart, known as an echocardiogram. Veterinarians may suspect a heart tumor after episodes of collapse and other evidence of poor heart function. These tumors may also be discovered incidentally on routine chest x-rays.
"
"A biopsy would also be required for a definitive diagnosis, but due to the location of the tumor around the heart, a biopsy is dangerous and typically not recommended. Most cardiac tumors are suspected to be hemangiosarcoma, but few are confirmed.
"
"Cardiac hemangiosarcoma is commonly discovered with other types of hemangiosarcoma, most notably of the spleen. During the diagnostic workup process for splenic hemangiosarcoma, veterinarians typically closely evaluate the liver, lungs, and heart, which are all common places for hemangiosarcoma to spread.
"
"Cutaneous/subcutaneous hemangiosarcoma
"
"Veterinarians typically start diagnosing skin tumors with a test called a fine needle aspirate (FNA). To perform an FNA, a veterinarian will use a needle to collect a small sample of tumor cells. These cells are then evaluated under a microscope.
"
"Some tumors easily shed cells during this process; however, most FNAs performed on hemangiosarcomas are only blood-filled and do not readily offer a diagnosis. A non-diagnostic FNA may raise a veterinarian’s suspicion of cutaneous or subcutaneous hemangiosarcoma. A surgical biopsy is required for a definitive diagnosis.
"
"Surgical removal of the tumor is the treatment of choice for most hemangiosarcomas. However, surgery is not always a practical option for tumors that have spread or are on organs that cannot be removed, like the heart. Surgery is most often used in cases of skin hemangiosarcoma and uncomplicated splenic hemangiosarcoma.
"
"Trauma: Some injuries that lead to abdominal bleeding will heal with medical management. This can include fluid therapy, transfusions, medications to enhance blood clotting, belly wraps, and other symptomatic and supportive care. However, more serious injuries often require surgery to stop the bleeding and repair or remove damaged tissues.
"
"Abdominal tumors: Benign abdominal tumors can often be successfully removed with surgery, but hemangiosarcoma is a different story. Only about half of the dogs who are diagnosed with hemangiosarcoma live longer than six months, even with surgery and chemotherapy. While a veterinarian can’t tell you with certainty before surgery what type of tumor your dog might have, they can talk to you about your dog’s likely prognosis based on what they have found during their physical examination and diagnostic workup.
"
"Post-operative bleeding: Mild cases of post-operative bleeding can sometimes be handled with belly wraps, fluid therapy, transfusions, medications to enhance blood clotting, and other types of symptomatic and supportive care. Surgery to close bleeding vessels is usually necessary when blood loss is more significant.
"
"Coagulation disorders: Dogs that have eaten anti-coagulant rodenticides (warfarin, diphacinone, chlorophacinone, brodifacoum, difenacoum, and bromadiolone, for example) will usually recover if they are treated with prescription vitamin-K medications. Immune-mediated diseases can often be managed with immunosuppressive drugs, but it’s also important to deal with any potential underlying health problems, like infections. Supportive care, including transfusions, may also be necessary.
"
"Dogs that are recovering from a hemoabdomen need to be watched closely. Follow your veterinarian’s instructions regarding home management and the need for future check-ups. Call your vet immediately if you notice the signs of internal bleeding returning or getting worse rather than better.
"
"Yes, both benign and malignant masses can cause internal bleeding in dogs. Diagnostic testing is necessary to determine what type is involved. Sometimes it’s best to proceed to surgery to remove the mass (or as much of the mass as possible) and then send a biopsy sample to the lab for identification.
"
"Any dog can develop a hemoabdomen, but certain causes may be more common in some types of dogs. For example, hemangiosarcoma of the spleen is most commonly diagnosed in older, large-breed dogs like German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers, and Golden Retrievers.

"When cooling your pet, never use ice, as it can increase the risk of shock (drop in blood pressure, further damage to organs) and even cause hypothermia. Try to move your pet to a cool or shaded area with a fan if possible. Wet your dog with room temperature water and drape wet towels on the back of the dog during transportation to the hospital.  
"
"Once you arrive at the hospital, the veterinarian will start with a thorough physical examination to check your dog’s mental status and temperature. If you initiated cooling measure before arriving at the hospital, the temperature may be normal and will need to be carefully monitored to make sure it does not become too low, creating hypothermia.
"
"A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will all likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation. There may already be elevation in liver and kidney values, but serial monitoring is recommended.
"
"Based on the diagnosis of heatstroke, your dog will need to be hospitalized and started on IV fluids to treat dehydration. Medication will be given to reduce or prevent symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea. Antibiotics will likely be a part of your pet’s treatment to prevent infection.
"
"Depending on the severity of your pet’s condition, medications may also be used to help with swelling of the brain and seizure activity. Additional care may include oxygen therapy, plasma transfusions, and/or anti-arrhythmic medications as indicated.
"
"While in the hospital, the veterinary staff will monitor your dog’s mental status, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate and effort, and may perform an electrocardiogram test. Repeat bloodwork is likely, to monitor any changes and help guide therapy.  
"
"Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of heatstroke are important for a dog’s survival and recovery. Recovering from heatstroke is directly related to how high the dog’s temperature was, for how long, and how quickly they arrived at the hospital. Major damage can occur when the body’s temperature reaches higher than 109 F. The prognosis is considered poor if multiple organ failure occurs.  
"
"Most dogs that survive the initial 24 hours will live but will remain hospitalized on IV fluids and supportive care for 2-3 days. Once discharged, they will need lots of rest and extra TLC, but typically they can make a full recovery and go on to live normal lives. Your vet will likely want to check bloodwork 1-2 weeks after the heatstroke event to ensure all organs are working properly.  
"
"Prevention is key for heatstroke in dogs; keep in mind the following when the weather is hot:
"
"Always ensure that your pet has access to shade and water when outdoors.
"
"Only exercise dogs in cooler parts of the day (early in the morning, late at night). Even short walks can cause heatstroke in predisposed dogs or on extremely hot, humid days.
"
"Never leave dogs alone in cars, even on seemingly cool days. Even if the windows are left partially open or the car is parked in the shade, the inside of the car can be greater than 40 F hotter than outside.
"
"On hot days, keep your pet inside the house with air-conditioning, especially if they have a predisposed condition such as older age, brachycephalic syndrome, obesity, heart disease, tracheal collapse, or laryngeal paralysis.  
"
"If your dog is showing signs of heatstroke, place them in a cool, shaded area with a fan directed at them if possible. Begin cooling your dog with room temperature water or towels soaked in water draped over the dog. Do NOT use ice. While you begin the cooling process, head immediately to the nearest veterinary emergency hospital.  
"
"The two main causes of heat stroke are dogs left in cars (even on seemingly cool days) and dogs exercised in hot, humid weather.

"Many forms of hemangiosarcoma will require chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with or without surgery. These treatments can greatly extend the life expectancy for most types of hemangiosarcoma. Chemotherapy slows the growth of tumors, and dogs typically handle it very well, as the doses of chemotherapy medications are different than those used in humans. Neither chemotherapy nor radiation will cure dogs of hemangiosarcoma, but they can increase their quality of life after their diagnosis.
"
"Other medications or treatments may be used to help minimize side effects or complications of hemangiosarcoma, such as:
"
"Anti-bleeding medications
"
"Procedures to remove fluid from around the heart, in the chest, or in the abdomen
"
"Bioactive extracts from mushrooms
"
"Anti-arrhythmic drugs
"
"Blood transfusions
"
"Hemangiosarcoma prognosis depends on tumor location, size, and spread to other organs (metastasis). Hemangiosarcoma is highly aggressive and locally invasive and has elevated metastasis rates. Cases caught and treated early can mean a longer life expectancy for your pet, although hemangiosarcoma mainly carries a poor prognosis.  
"
"Splenic hemangiosarcoma has a poor predicted outcome, especially in cases with no surgical intervention or only surgical removal of the spleen without chemotherapy. These dogs typically live between 2 weeks and 3 months after diagnosis. If the dog is a candidate for surgical removal of the spleen and chemotherapy, the survival time increases to around 9 months. However, fewer than 10% of dogs with splenic hemangiosarcoma are alive 1 year after diagnosis.
"
"Cardiac hemangiosarcoma, like most other cardiac tumors, is incurable and comes with a grave prognosis. Treatment for these dogs is palliative care, which helps to increase comfort and quality of life. Some dogs may live up to 4 months if treated with chemotherapy, and days to 2 weeks if not treated. These dogs have a high rate of fatal arrhythmias.
"
"Cutaneous/subcutaneous hemangiosarcoma carries a better prognosis, although it is highly dependent on tumor size and how long it has been present. Cutaneous hemangiosarcomas, especially those caused by UV, rarely metastasize, and dogs may survive for years after removal. Pet parents must be vigilant in monitoring areas exposed to UV and have any tumors that recur removed.
"
"Subcutaneous hemangiosarcoma carries a worse prognosis, as the tumor invades the deeper layers of the skin and musculature. Survival times of these dogs may only be in months.
"
"Dogs treated with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy require frequent follow-up exams, bloodwork, and diagnostic imaging to assess disease progression.
"
"Unfortunately, there is nothing pet parents or veterinarians can do to prevent hemangiosarcoma in dogs. Early diagnosis is crucial for longer survival times. Frequent veterinary exams (at least every six months) and diagnostic testing are essential to diagnose hemangiosarcoma early.
"
"Hemangiosarcoma may be painful when it causes acute blood loss or difficulty breathing.
"
"Most types of hemangiosarcoma spread to other organs in the body, causing further disease. These tumors are highly vascular (blood vessel-related) and will rupture into the chest or abdominal cavity as the disease progresses.
"
"Hemangiosarcoma is highly aggressive and locally invasive, with high spread rates to distant sites.

"
"Dirofilaria immitis is the organism that causes heartworm disease not only in dogs, but also in cats, ferrets, and other mammals. It is a large worm, reaching up to a foot or more in length, and as it completes its life cycle, which takes about six to seven months, it ends up in the heart and pulmonary vessels, where it can live for several more years. As the heart becomes clogged with worms, there is less blood it can push out to the rest of the body, and heart failure can result.
"
"The severity of the infection will be related to the symptoms present, and symptoms of heartworm disease are related to the organs affected: the heart and lungs. Symptoms often include:  
"
"Cough  
"
"Lethargy  
"
"Exercise intolerance  
"
"Collapse  
"
"Sudden death   
"
"Some dogs may show weight loss, difficulty breathing, and even excessive panting. Left untreated, dogs may go on to experience right-sided heart failure and ascites (buildup of fluid in the abdomen).
"
"Heart valve malformation, also termed atrioventricular valve dysplasia (AVD), is a condition that occurs because of a developmental malformation (abnormal structure) of the mitral or tricuspid valve. This causes the valves to not close appropriately to stop blood flowing across them. The valves are narrowed and can result in an obstruction of blood flow through the heart. Symptoms depend on the severity of the valve narrowing and location of the malformation.
"
"A dog’s heart is composed of four chambers: two on top and two on bottom. The two top chambers are termed the atria, and the bottom two chambers the ventricles. The atrioventricular (AV) valves separate the four chambers. The valves open and close using leaflets to allow blood to flow from the atria to the ventricles in an orderly and smooth fashion, while the heart is beating.
"
"The AV valve on the left side of the heart is called the mitral valve and has two leaflets. The AV valve on the right side of the heart is the tricuspid valve and has three leaflets. Low-oxygen blood from the body enters the right atrium, passes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle, then passes to the lungs to pick up oxygen. This high-oxygen blood returns to the left atrium, passes through the mitral valve to the left ventricle and then is pumped out to the body.
"
"This is a cycle that is spontaneous and it is what keeps us alive. The job of the AV valves is to prevent the backflow of blood from the ventricles to the atria while the heart is contracting. If the valves are not properly functioning, blood can back flow and lead to congestive heart failure (CHF).
"
"AV malformations are considered congenital abnormalities, meaning that they are present at birth and are often diagnosed in the first few years of life. They can be diagnosed later in life, if mild.
"
"There are two main types of AV malformations:
"
"Mitral valve dysplasia (MVD): This is a condition where the mitral valve becomes narrow, allowing a backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium, eventually affecting high-oxygen blood that flow to the lungs from the heart. The most common breeds predisposed to this condition are Bull Terriers, Dalmatians, German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, Great Danes, Mastiffs, Newfoundlands, and Rottweilers.
"
"Tricuspid valve dysplasia (TVD): This is a condition where the tricuspid valve becomes narrowed, allowing a backflow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium, eventually affecting low-oxygen blood flow returning from the body back to the heart. The most common breeds predisposed to this condition are Boxers, Dogue de Bordeaux, German Shepherds, Great Danes, Great Pyrenees, Irish Setters, Labrador Retrievers, Old English Sheepdogs, and Weimaraners.
"
"AVD leads to the atria on the affected valve side which enlarges (dilates) the ventricle. Eventually, this causes volume overload and affects blood flow, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and/or the abdomen (CHF).
"
" 
"
"Symptoms of AVD can range from non-existent early in the disease to severe. These signs usually begin within the first 1 to 2 years of life. Heart murmurs, or an abnormal “whooshing” noise when the vet listens to the dog’s heart with a stethoscope, are usually heard.
"
"A hematoma is defined as a localized collection of blood outside the blood vessels. A seroma is similar except that the fluid accumulation contains only serum without red blood cells being present.
"
"Hematomas and seromas can occur anywhere in the body. Subdermal hematomas/seromas form under the skin and are probably the most commonly type of hematoma or seroma. However, hematomas and seromas can also occur within the head or brain, within other organs of the body and even on the ear (i.e., aural hematoma).
"
"Hematomas/seromas can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how they affect cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"Symptoms will depend on the location of the hematoma or seroma.
"
"Trauma is the most common cause of hematomas and seromas. Other causes include blood clotting abnormalities which lead to excessive bleeding.
"
"Diagnosis of a hematoma or seroma depends on the location as well. Subdermal hematomas and seromas can generally be diagnosed by physical examination coupled with evaluation of fluid withdrawn from the lesion. Hematomas and seromas in internal organs or in the brain/head may require special imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, MRI or CT scan) for diagnosis.
"
"
"
"If small, the hematoma or seroma may reabsorb and resolve without intervention. Larger hematomas and seromas may need to be drained by your veterinarian. In some cases, it may be necessary to place a temporary drain in the area to allow further accumulation of blood and/or serum to drain from the area.

"A myopathy is a muscular disease in which the muscle fibers do not function due to any of the common reasons, ultimately resulting in overall muscular weakness. The form of myopathy described in this article is specifically seen in Labrador retrievers, especially yellow Labs.
"
"Symptoms typically develop between the ages of three to four months, many of which worsen with cold weather, excitement, and exercise. In addition, improvements may be seen once the dog is allowed to rest. Some of the more common symptoms include:
"
"Inherited in Labrador retrievers.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- the results of which may indicate a mild increase of the creatine kinase enzyme (normally present in muscle, brain, and other tissues).
"
"Your veterinarian may also take a muscle biopsy and send it to veterinary pathologist for further evaluation. The results may show abnormalities related to muscle cells.
"
"
"
"Treating this type of myopathy is non-specific and directed towards alleviating the symptoms. To improve muscle strength, for example, L-carnitine supplements are given to the dog.
"
"Prognosis for Labradors with this form of myopathy is variable; however, most clinical signs stabilize once the dog reaches about one year of age. Do not place your Labrador in cold areas, as it may exacerbate the symptoms. In addition, due to the genetic nature of this disease, your veterinarian may recommend against breeding the dog, its parents, or littermates.

"Mosquitoes serve as the primary vector (carrier) for transmission of heartworm disease; transmission cannot occur from one dog to another. As mosquitoes bite and take a blood meal from an infected host, they ingest circulating microfilariae, or young immature heartworms. Inside the mosquito, the microfilariae undergo three stages of larval development (called L1, L2, and L3).  
"
"When the same mosquito bites a dog, the L3 is deposited onto the dog’s skin, and it then migrates into the dog’s body and develops into L4. Then as an L5, it migrates throughout the tissues and bloodstream, winding up in the heart, where it takes up residence as an adult. This entire process usually takes about four months to complete. 
"
"A few months later, around 7 months of age, the adult females become sexually mature, mate, and produce microfilariae. The commercially prepared tests to diagnose heartworm disease in the veterinary hospital detect antigens (proteins uniquely found on the surface of an organism that are used to detect the presence of that organism in the sample) produced by the female adult heartworm; that’s why testing usually starts around 7 months of age.
"
"Dogs 7 months and older should be tested for heartworm disease at least annually. If the dog misses a dose of prevention, then she should be tested more frequently. Testing is often done in the hospital at the bedside and requires a small amount of blood.  
"
"The most widely used method for diagnosing heartworm disease is antigen-based testing. Antigens are proteins uniquely found on the surface of an organism that are used to detect the presence of that organism in the sample. In this case, the antigens being tested for are produced by the female adult heartworm, and if the test shows positive, then the dog is infected.  
"
"Other tests that can be performed include a blood smear or a modified Knott’s test (often a test that is sent out for diagnosis), which are done to check for the presence of circulating microfilariae.  
"
"Once diagnosis has been obtained, your veterinarian may recommend more testing, which is used to find out the severity of the infection as well as the amount of risk involved for treatment. Other testing often includes chest radiographs, EKG, blood pressure, cardiac enzyme evaluation (NT-proBNP), echocardiogram, blood work, and urine testing.  
"
"Class I dogs are those with the lowest amount of risk for treatment, and Class IV dogs are those often diagnosed with caval syndrome and are at highest risk. This means the worm burden is so great that the worms are blocking blood from exiting the heart. These dogs are dying and require surgical removal of the worms (often done by a specialist) to survive.
"
"Once your dog is diagnosed, your veterinarian will most likely explain to you next steps including treatment options, more diagnostics, and time frame for follow-up visits.  
"
"First, your dog should have his activities restricted as exercise can increase the potential for the heartworms to dislodge and cause clots elsewhere in the body. Additionally, if your dog has circulating microfilariae in his bloodstream, mosquitoes, after ingesting a blood meal from your dog, can then transmit the parasite to others, so limited exposure to the outside is recommended.  
"
"Certain medications may be prescribed, such as: 
"
"Steroids: to decrease inflammation created by the worm itself 
"
"Antibiotics: doxycycline is used to kill Wolbachia, a symbiote organism that lives within the heartworm. Without the symbiote, the host heartworm becomes easier to kill and secondary inflammation is minimized. 
"
"Specific kind of heartworm preventive: to prevent younger worms from developing into adults and to rid the bloodstream of any circulating microfilariae   
"
"An injection containing the arsenic-based compound melarsomine will be given to your dog 60 days, 90 days, and 91 days after diagnosis by the veterinarian. This is a medication designed to kill the adult heartworms and is usually administered in the lower back deep into the muscle. As it is painful, pain medications will most likely be sent home at those visits as well.     
"
"The best way to treat your dog is to do your best to prevent the disease in the first place with year-round heartworm prevention. The good news is that there are multiple types and forms of heartworm prevention on the market, and they are all affordable.  
"
"There are tablets, topicals, and even injectable versions that can provide anywhere from 1 month to 12 months of protection. There are even products that are combined with flea and tick control to give your dog a more comprehensive preventive profile.  
"
"All products are designed to kill the L3 and/or L4 heartworm larvae, and some will clear the blood system from circulating microfilariae.  
"
"If your dog tests positive for heartworm disease, it is important to discuss the specific type of preventative needed while treating it, as there are only a few that should be given to minimize secondary complications.  
"
"Clinical signs vary, depending on the AV valve affected. MVD clinical signs include:
"
"Coughing
"
"Tiring easily during exercise
"
"Increased respiratory rate or effort
"
"Abnormal coloration to the gums (blue/gray)
"
"Collapse, weakness, or fainting
"
"TVD clinical signs include:
"
"Stunted growth
"
"Tiring easily with exercise
"
"Abdominal distention due to fluid accumulation
"
"Collapse, weakness, or fainting
"
"There is no proven cause of these malformations, but they are thought to be caused by genetic mutations, poor nutrition while in the uterus, infections while in the uterus, and some medications administered during pregnancy. Vets suspect that these AV defects are inherited based on predisposed dog breeds.
"
"Diagnosis is based on history of clinical signs, and sometimes looking into your dog’s lineage. Your vet will also take bloodwork, blood pressure, and radiographs to assess heart’s size, the blood vessels going to and from the heart, and the lungs or abdomen to analyze any fluid accumulation.
"
"For a definite diagnose of AVD—and to assess fluid accumulation—a veterinarian may recommend an echocardiography (ultrasounds of the heart). This “gold standard” test will help diagnose and monitor the progression of heart disease in dogs.
"
"An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) may be performed to assess the electrical function of the heart and to rule out any cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). Evaluating heart rhythm can often help determine which side of the heart the disease initiated.
"
"Treatment of AVD focuses on management of clinical signs since there is no current cure for AVD. Usually, this means treating and managing CHF. In severe cases, this includes hospitalization with oxygen therapy, diuretic therapy, and in right-sided CHF, removal of abdominal fluid for relief.
"
"Oral medications are often used once changes to the heart chambers are noted or CHF is diagnosed, and these are usually life-long medications. Oral medications include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and Pimobendan. Anti-arrhythmic medications may be needed in some cases. The veterinarian will often recommend exercise restrictions and sodium reduction to your dog’s diet.
"
"Artificial tricuspid valve replacements have been attempted—but often fail because of complications. This surgery is often not feasible because of cost and lack of availability.
"
"Unfortunately, the long-term prognosis for AVD is unknown-to-poor depending on the severity of the condition. Prognosis worsens once a pet enters the stage of congestive heart failure.
"
"Dogs diagnosed with this condition are often on life-long cardiac medications and need frequent visits to the veterinarian (or a board-certified cardiologist) to monitor progression of the disease. Medications may be added or changed, depending on how the condition progresses.
"
"Dogs diagnosed with AVD often require decreased stress, decreased exercise, and changes in their nutrition to decrease sodium, and to assure foods contain the right amino acids and nutrients. These dogs should never be used for breeding as vets suspect these conditions are inherited.
"
"Dogs with mild disease can live normal life spans. Dogs with more severe disease of the valves may only survive up to 1-2 years.

"
"You should speak with your veterinarian to decide the best type of prevention for your dog’s lifestyle and your budget. Limiting your dog’s exposure to mosquitoes will also help, but in some places, limiting exposure is nearly impossible. It only takes one infected mosquito to cause heartworm disease.  
"
"Treatment for heartworm disease is not risk free. Dogs that undergo heartworm treatment as discussed above can suffer from anaphylaxis (shock), emboli (clots), and sudden death, not to mention the possibility of abscess (pocket of pus) formation at the site of melarsomine injection and the emotional distress from months of exercise restriction.  
"
"Dogs can also suffer from long-term health risks from the damage caused by the worms to their heart and lungs. Scarring and inflammation (swelling) generated by the worms makes it difficult for blood to be pumped through the heart and lungs, and right-sided heart failure can develop, even with successful treatment. 
"
"The degree of severity will affect the prognosis, and the sooner the disease is caught and treated, the greater likelihood there is for a good outcome. Unfortunately, dogs that suffer from heartworm disease do not get immunity and are at risk for becoming infected again in the future. That is why year-round prevention is critical for your dog’s health.
"
"Prevention is key to stop heartworm disease from starting in the first place. Your veterinarian can help you determine which heartworm preventative medication is best for your pup based on their age and health. Commonly recommend heartworm medications include:
"
"Always chat with your veterinarian first before starting a new medication for your dog. They will help you determine the best medication based on your dog's health. 
"
"Heartworm disease has primarily been known to cause health-related issues in dogs, cats, and ferrets. Yet heartworm disease can affect multiple mammals, and according to the CDC, that includes humans. Fortunately, your dog is not contagious: the disease in humans is acquired from the mosquito itself and is not that common.
"
"Yes. If caught early and treated appropriately, your dog may go on to have a good quality life.  Unfortunately, some dogs may experience undesirable consequences either from treatment or from the disease itself and may end up with lifelong complications.
"
"Some dogs may not show any signs, especially if they live a more sedentary lifestyle. Others, however, may show exercise intolerance and coughing.
"
"Dogs presenting with Class I heartworm disease, and even Class II, have a much better prognosis and survivability than those in Class III and IV. Class IV dogs require surgery for lifesaving treatment and will die without it.

"Infective endocarditis is a medical condition in which the inner lining of heart has become inflamed in response to an infection in the body. Generalized infections in the body may invade the inner lining of heart, as well as the valves of the heart. This type of infective endocarditis can occur in response to any infection of the body.
"
"Endocarditis is more common in middle-sized to large breed dogs, with most between the ages of four and six. Males are generally at higher risk than females. If the underlying disease if not treated in time, complications can lead to heart failure and death.
"
"A variable set of symptoms may be present in patient depending upon the nature and site of infection, complications and extent of affects on heart. The following symptoms may be present in an affected dog:
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a complete background history of your dog’s health, including information about the onset of symptoms, any illnesses or injuries your dog has experienced, any surgical procedures, and the duration and frequency of symptoms that have been apparent.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination, including basic laboratory testing: a complete blood count (CBC) test, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these tests may reveal information related to the underlying infection, and may point to the organs being affected.
"
"Blood cultures will help to determine the causative agent involved in the infection and will also allow your veterinarian to determine the most suitable antibiotics for treatment of the underlying infection. A visual examination of the heart, using radiographic (i.e., X-ray) studies can help your veterinarian to determine the extent of heart involvement, and echocardiography, which uses ultrasound to image the inner organs, is an excellent tool for a detailed evaluation of the heart's functioning ability. Your veterinarian will also need to measure the electrical activity of the heart, which is done using an electrocardiogram (ECG) to record the heart's movement and impulses.
"
"
"
"This is serious health problem for animals, and your dog will most likely require hospitalization for intensive care and treatment. Fluid therapy and antibiotic therapy will be given to restore and maintain body fluid levels and to control the infection, respectively.
"
"Patients with valve involvement generally are not given a good prognosis. However, this is often dependent upon the stage of the infection and the functionality of the heart. Treatment is normally given over the course of 12 weeks, during which time your veterinarian will take multiple blood samples at regular intervals to measure how much of the infection, if any, is still present. After antibiotic therapy has stopped, blood samples will be taken to confirm that the infection has been resolved.
"
"If your dog’s heart problem was mild, it will usually respond well to treatment. If the endocarditis was diagnosed in time, and aggressive treatment was employed along with a detailed follow up, the chances of a full recovery are also greatly enhanced.
"
"You may need to take your dog to the veterinarian for weekly follow-up examinations, and to determine overall progress. Your veterinarian may also suggest a special diet for your dog to improve cardiovascular functioning and organ health. Treatment will be directed towards treating the underlying infection as well as the heart problems that have resulted from such infections. In cases where a diagnosis was not made early on, and the   disease has had an opportunity to advance, the overall prognosis may be very poor due to further complications that are common in affected dogs. In such a case, your veterinarian will advise you on alternative plans.

"A rhabdomyoma is an extremely rare, benign, non-spreading, cardiac muscle tumor that occurs only half as often as its malignant version: rhabdomyosarcomas, an invasive, metastasizing (spreading) tumor.
"
"Rhabdomyomas are usually found in the heart, and are suspected of being congenital in origin (present at birth). This type of tumor does not become malignant, nor does it metastasize through the body. They are very rarely found outside of the heart, but do occur in other places of the body on occasion. They have been reported in the tongue, and in the larynx (voice box) in dogs.
"
"Rhabdomyoma can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Idiopathic (unknown)
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. From there, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Your veterinarian will use the results of the bloodwork to confirm, or rule out, other diseases.  Bloodwork will typically appear normal in patients with a rhabdomyoma, since the tumor is relatively harmless.
"
"X-ray imaging, and an echocardiogram of the heart may help your veterinarian to diagnose a rhabdomyoma. Additional examination using an electrocardiogram will note heart arrhythmias (rhythm abnormalities).  For a definitive diagnosis, an examination of tissue from the tumor (biopsy) can be performed.
"
"
"
"Treatment is not usually necessary for a rhabdomyoma in the heart, since surgery of the heart would carry more risk than any benefit it might provide. But for rhabdomyomas located in an area other than the heart, surgery to remove them should be fairly uncomplicated since they are not very invasive.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule monthly follow-ups for the first three months after your dog has been discharged in order to do progress checks. Follow-up visits may then be scheduled at three to six month intervals for another year. The concern is that rhabdomyomas in the heart may lead to right-sided congestive heart failure due to obstruction of blood flow.

"Pericarditis describes a condition where the dog's pericardium becomes inflamed. The pericardium is made up of two layers: a fibrous outer layer and a membranous inner layer that adheres closely to the heart. Within the sac is a layer of pericardial fluid made up of serum, a watery fluid that serves to keep the surfaces of the membranous sac and heart moist. The body's membranes will also secrete serum when they detect inflammation of the surrounding tissues and organs.
"
"When either of the layers of the pericardium becomes inflamed, the natural reaction is for the membranes to produce more serum, which leads to an excess of serum in the pericardium. The buildup of fluid compresses the heart, placing too much pressure on it, and on the surrounding tissue, typically leading to more inflammation and further swelling.
"
"Pericarditis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Right-sided congestive heart failure is the usual outcome of pericarditis. Other symptoms include:
"
"Dogs will usually progress to a hemorrhagic pericarditis (blood in the heart sac), which can lead to a life-threatening buildup of fluid in the heart sac, and tamponade (compression of the heart by the fluid in the heart sac). Hemorrhagic pericarditis is seen in medium to large-breed dogs that are young to middle-aged.
"
"May be diagnosed as idiopathic or agnogenic (meaning that it is not related to anything in particular, and is of unknown cause). The only apparent problem may be that there is excess fluid buildup, with seemingly nothing else to explain the disease.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel to look for an underlying cause, or systemic illness. If bacterial based pericarditis is suspected, your veterinarian will take a fluid sample of the pericardial effusion for aerobic and anaerobic culture. That is, examination of tissue that lives with oxygen, and tissue that lives without oxygen.
"
"Thoracic radiograph images (chest X-rays), and echocardiogram images are essential for an accurate visual diagnosis. Other, less sensitive tests which might still supply useful information about the heart are cardiac catheterization, where a tube is inserted into an artery or vein in the arm or leg, and then threaded up into the chambers of the heart; and electrocardiogram, which records the heart's electrical muscle activity. Both tests measure functionality: blood pressure and flow, rhythm, and how well the heart muscle is pumping.
"
"
"
"Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the pericarditis.  All dogs with this disease will need to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit. Chemotherapy will be prescribed if there are cancerous neoplastic (abnormal tissue growth) conditions, and bacterial infections will be treated with the appropriate antibiotics. A pericardectomy surgery to remove part of the pericardium may also be necessary.
"
"This condition will sometimes reoccur.  If signs of illness return at anytime after taking your dog home, call your veterinarian immediately for advisement.

"A heart murmur is the noise made when there is abnormal movement of blood through the heart. An abnormal flow of blood changes or muffles the normal (lub-dub) heartbeat sound.
"
"Murmurs are common in dogs, but they are only a symptom or sign of disease. So treatment and care are usually aimed at the underlying condition.
"
"The heart is composed of four chambers: left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, and right ventricle. Between each atrium and ventricle, there is a “door” called a valve. Each valve prevents blood from flowing back into the previous chamber and keeps it moving in the right direction at the right time.
"
"The circuit of blood through the body is as follows:
"
"body  right atrium  tricuspid valve  right ventricle  pulmonary valve  lungs  left atrium  mitral valve  left ventricle  aortic valve body, then the cycle repeats.
"
"As the blood flows through each valve, it produces a sound. When a veterinarian uses a stethoscope to listen to the heartbeat of a healthy dog, they can hear the closing of the mitral and tricuspid valves (lub) and the closing of the aortic and pulmonary valves (dub).
"
"There are four main reasons for an abnormal flow of blood in the heart:
"
"Abnormal valve shape or size
"
"Digoxin is used to treat congestive heart failure. Its primary benefit effect is to help the heart to contract. While digoxin is useful at times, the difference between a therapeutic dosage and a toxic dosage can be slight. For that reason, the veterinarian will need to monitor the digoxin blood levels throughout treatment. Owners also need be aware of toxicity signs, as they can be subtle and may look just like a heart failure.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"One of the most significant concerns about this condition is toxicity to the heart cells themselves, called myocardial toxicity. When this occurs, abnormal heart rhythms can occur, often leading to heart failure. Typically depression, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea are often the first symptoms an animal will display. This can result even when the medication is given at the prescribed dose because the therapeutic and toxic levels are very close.
"
"With acute overdose, the dog may become comatose or have seizures. Any time toxicity is expected, it is important to consult with a veterinarian as the toxicity can progress quickly.
"
"It is important to have routine blood samples to assess the digoxin level in the serum. Doses are initially based on lean body weight, yet each dog metabolizes the drug differently. Therefore, the veterinarian will take a blood sample to determine the serum digoxin level throughout the treatment, but additional blood analyses for electrolytes, organ function and cell counts are also important.
"
"An electrocardiogram, which checks for abnormal rhythms (arrhythmias), is critical in determining the prognosis and an appropriate treatment plan.
"
"
"
"No additional digoxin should be given after you notice symptoms of toxicity in your dog. It is important that the pet receive emergency medical attention if there is an overdose, because toxicity can lead to death quickly. If an acute overdose has taken place, it may be also necessary to induce vomiting by using activated charcoal.
"
"The fluid and electrolyte balance also needs to be corrected, as abnormalities are a significant contributor to the toxic effects to the heart. If an abnormal rhythm is present, antiarrhythmics may be given. A continuous electrocardiogram may be placed on the dog to monitor heart rhythm.
"
"Antibody therapy, a medication given to bind with a powerful cardiac stimulant that is in the blood stream, is used in humans with digoxin toxicity and has been used on animals. However, the medication can be costly.
"
"Congestive heart failure is progressive. Therefore, management of the disease will change as it progresses and different medications will be prescribed. Careful management and frequent follow-up exams are critical, especially if digoxin is part of another treatment plan. Expect to have blood levels checked periodically throughout treatment.
"
"Having a digoxin toxicity episode may concern the dog owner into stopping the digoxin treatment, but lower doses can begin again after the blood has dropped below toxic range and the pet has no further signs of toxicity. Recent reports have indicated using digoxin at levels below therapeutic levels can be beneficial.

"Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart's muscular wall (or myocardium), often caused by infectious agents. That is, bacterial, viral, rikettsial, fungal, and protozoal agents directly affecting the heart or reaching the heart from other body parts can lead to myocarditis.
"
"Clinical symptoms depend on the type of infection and extent of lesions, but in severe cases, heart failure may result.
"
"The inflammation itself may be focal or diffused throughout the myocardium. Other symptoms associated with myocarditis include:
"
" 
"
"Although viral, bacterial, rikettsial, funal, and protozoal infections are the most common cause of myocaditis, drug toxicity to the heart can also be a factor.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, paying close attention to the dog's cardiovascular system. Various laboratory tests -- such as complete blood count (CBC), blood culture biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- will be used to isolate and identify the causative organism. The abnormalities revealed by these tests, however, will depend on the affected organ.
"
"Your veterinarian will also perform an echocardiogram (EKG) on the dog to evaluate the extent of myocardial damage and abnormal accumulation of fluid around the heart. In addition to evaluating the abnormalities related to heart dysfunction, EKG findings help in differentiating the location of the lesions within heart. Thoracic X-rays, meanwhile, help evaluate the heart size, whether fluids are located in the lungs, and other such abnormalities.
"
"Other more specific testing include pathological exams of fluid samples taken from around the heart.
"
"
"
"Dogs with severe myocarditis, congestive heart failure (CHF), or severe heart rhythm problems may need to be hospitalized for intensive care and treatment. If specific causative organism is identified, infection will be treated with suitable medicine, such as antibiotics to fight off bacterial infections. There are also medications to correct heart rhythym issues, should the dog be suffering from them. In some patients, a pacemaker may need to be implanted.
"
"The overall prognosis for myocarditis depends on the extent and severity of disease. Dogs with CHF as a result of myocarditis, for example, have very poor prognosis, while those with milder forms of the disease respond well to treatment.
"
"You will need to visit your veterinarian regularly for follow-up evaluation and frequent laboratory testing will be conducted to monitor progress and response to treatment. Limiting your dog's activity is important for recovery, as well as setting aside a quiet place for it to rest, away from household activity, children, and other pets.
"
"Certain diet restrictions may be recommended, especially those concerning your dog's salt intake.

"Obstruction of the valve or in the chamber
"
"Back-flow of blood through a valve because the valve does not shut tightly
"
"Abnormal opening between structures
"
"With a stethoscope, veterinarians can hear a regular heartbeat (lub-dub) in dogs. But, when there is an abnormal flow of blood, the murmur changes or muffles the normal heartbeat sound. A murmur can have a distinct “whoosh,” “shoosh,” or continuous muffle. With each progressive stage of murmur, the sounds become more intense.
"
"Heart murmurs in dogs are graded on a scale of I to VI. As the grade increases, the murmur becomes easier to hear and indicates the disease process is advanced.
"
"Grade I: Least serious; murmur is barely heard with a stethoscope and requires a very quiet room to hear it
"
"Grade II: Soft; murmur is easily heard with a stethoscope
"
"Grade III: Loud; murmur is easily heard with a stethoscope on one side of chest
"
"Grade IV: Loud; murmur is heard on both sides of chest
"
"Grade V: Very loud; murmur is felt with hand when placed against chest
"
"Grade VI: Most severe, loudest; murmur is felt through chest wall and easily heard with
"
"a stethoscope off the chest
"
"A heart murmur is only one sign of an underlying disease. Other signs associated with heart murmurs in dogs include:
"
"Coughing
"
"Weakness, collapsing, or fainting
"
"Exercise intolerance
"
"Decreased stamina
"
"Heavy breathing while resting
"
"Pale or blue gums
"
"Poor growth
"
"Weight loss
"
"Poor oral/dental health
"
"The sound a heart murmur creates is detected with a stethoscope during a physical exam. To identify the underlying condition, veterinarians rely on the following: 
"
"X-rays: determine the physical size of the heart and allow a view to surrounding organs, such as the lungs.
"
"Electrocardiograms (ECGs): detect irregular heartbeats, abnormal heart rates, and arrhythmias (irregular rhythms).
"
"Echocardiograms (echos): determine the location of a heart murmur and, in some instances, indicate the speed and direction of blood flow across valves and in the chambers. 
"
"Blood work: identifies underlying diseases that cause murmurs, such as heartworm disease, anemia, and hypothyroidism, by adding stress on the heart, worsening the heart murmur.
"
"The result of each test provides one piece of the puzzle, and when put together, the vet can identify the problem causing the murmur.
"
"Treatment of heart murmurs in dogs focuses on identifying the underlying disease and ways to address it. To promote heart health, your dog may be put on a combination of specialized diet, medication, and supportive care. Your vet may recommend physical exam visits every 6 months to monitor the murmur. This may include repeated testing, depending on your pet’s condition. 
"
"Some heart defects that are present since birth may be surgically corrected. A small group of murmurs that are common in puppies are called benign (innocent or physiological) murmurs. These do not require any treatment because they usually resolve by 16 weeks of age. Regular monitoring every three to four weeks is advised to ensure that no other problems develop until the murmur resolves.
"
"Heart medications are used for dogs with advanced stages of the disease. Not every cause of a heart murmur is related to heart disease, but if needed, these medications promote healthy blood flow (decreasing stress on the heart) and improve the heart’s ability to pump efficiently. 
"
"Medications often need adjustments to find the right combination for each pet.
"
"Nutrition is a great way to encourage the health of your pet. For dogs with advanced heart disease, diets are aimed to decrease the retention of sodium and chloride and promote healthy blood flow.
"
"Your veterinarian can help you determine the most appropriate diet and provide the prescription.
"
"For other underlying diseases such as hypothyroidism, which causes weight gain and increased stress on the heart, your dog may be placed on a diet to promote weight loss and balance thyroid hormones.
"
"Obesity in dogs has been associated with breathing difficulty and increased stress on the heart. A balanced diet with light, frequent exercise can promote good heart health. Talk to your veterinarian before starting any exercise regimen.
"
"Poor oral health is associated with heart diseases such as endocarditis, so prevent tooth decay by regularly brushing your dog’s teeth and treat dental disease as recommended.
"
"The prognosis for pets with heart murmurs depends on the cause of the murmur. In the case of a benign puppy murmur, no treatment is required and the prognosis is generally good to excellent. If the murmur is caused by a repairable defect or obstruction, it may resolve over time after surgical repair. For a dog that has advancing heart disease the prognosis for a murmur is extremely variable, depending on the type of defect.

"Myocardial tumors refer to tumors that specifically affect the heart. These types of tumors are rare, and when they do occur, they tend to occur in older dogs. Benign tumors are masses of tissue that do not metastasize, whereas malignant tumors metastasize throughout the body. Abnormal tissue growth arising from the blood vessels in the heart can be malignant, as with hemangiosarcomas — rare, rapidly reproducing tissue growths; or they may be benign, as is the case with hemangiomas — harmless growths consisting mainly of newly formed blood or lymph vessels.
"
"When a tumor arises from the fibrous tissue, like heart valve tissue, the tumor is called a fibroma if it is benign, and a fibrosarcoma if it is malignant. There are also tumors that develop in the softer, connective tissue in the upper chambers of the heart (atria). Benign tumors of this sort are called myxomas, and malignant tumors are called myxosarcomas. Tumors that arise from the skeletal muscle in the heart are referred to as rhabdomyosarcomas, and they are always malignant.
"
"There are also tumors that can spread to the heart secondarily. Some tumors which do not arise in the heart, but which spread to it are: lymphomas - malignant tumors of the lymph nodes; neurofibromas - benign tumors of nerve fiber origin; granular cell tumors - origin is unknown, and they can be malignant or benign; and osteosarcomas - malignant tumors that originate in the bone.
"
"Symptoms are dependent on what type of tumor is in the heart, and where it is located in the heart:
"
"The causes for myocardial tumors are unknown.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, including a baseline blood work profile. This will include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. A chest x-ray and ultrasound imaging will allow your veterinarian to visually examine the heart, so that a complete assessment can be made of the heart and any masses that are present within it. An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Your veterinarian may also need to take a surgical tissue sample of the mass for biopsy.
"
"
"
"Even if the mass in the heart is extensive, or has begun to spread through the body, surgical resection is still the recommended treatment of choice for most heart tumors. This holds even if the surgery will not cure the condition, but if the tumor is benign, surgical resection may be curative. Chemotherapy can be administered in the case of malignant heart tumors, but unfortunately, in many cases patients will die in spite of treatment.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for in order to perform serial heart ultrasounds on your dog. These examinations will help your doctor to follow the progress of your dog’s condition, as well as to check the heart muscle for signs of doxorubicin toxicity — if doxorubicin has been prescribed as part of a chemotherapeutic program. Doxorubicin is an effective drug for treating malignant cancers, but one of the negative side effects is that it can damage heart muscle. Your veterinarian will also take chest x-rays at each visit to make sure the tumor has not spread into any other parts of your dog's body. The final prognosis for most malignant myocardial tumors is guarded to poor.

"The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat, or contract, by firing off electrical surges. Sinus arrest is a disorder of heart beat impulse formation caused by a slowing down, or cessation of spontaneous sinus nodal automaticity – the automatic behavior of the tissues that set the pace for the heart's rhythm. It is the failure of the sinoatrial (SA) node to initiate an impulse at the expected time that leads to sinus arrest. Persistent sinus arrest that is not due to the use of a drug is often indicative of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) - a disorder of the heart’s electrical impulse formation within the sinus node.
"
"Sinoatrial block is a disorder of impulse conduction. This is when an impulse formed within the sinus node fails to be conducted through the atria (the interior of the heart), or when it does so with delay. Most commonly, the basic rhythm of the sinus node is not disturbed when the impulses fail to conduct properly.
"
"Sinoatrial block is classified into first, second, and third-degree SA block (similar to degrees of atrioventricular [AV] block). It is difficult to diagnose first and third-degree SA block from an electrocardiogram (ECG) reading only.
"
"Second-degree SA block is the most common type of SA block, and the only degree that can be recognized on a surface ECG. In addition, there are two types of second-degree SA blocks: Mobitz type I (also called Wenckebach periodicity)  and Mobitz type II.

"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. The electrolyte panel may show hyperkalemia, abnormal levels of potassium in the blood, which can lead to arrhythmias. You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health, including a history of symptoms, and their onset.
"
"Thoracic (chest) x-rays and/or a cardiac ultrasound imaging may be taken by your veterinarian to confirm or rule out heart disease and abnormal tissue growth (neoplasia).
"
"A provocative atropine response test may be done to assess sinus node function. This test uses the drug atropine to stimulate the firing action of the SA Node. Dogs with SSS generally will have no response, or will have an incomplete response to the atropine.
"
"
"
"Most patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Only patients showing clinical signs of illness should be hospitalized. Fluid therapy will be given to patients in need of it. Very ill patients that are not responding to medical therapy may require implantation of an artificial pacemaker, and will be hospitalized prior to surgery in preparation of it. If your pet becomes excessively weak, or is showing signs of losing consciousness, or fainting, it will need to have its activity restricted.
"
"After care will be dependent on whether your pet has an underlying disease, along with the SA block. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary, and an ECG reading will be done at each visit to follow your pet's progress.  If your pet becomes weak, or loses consciousness, contact your veterinarian immediately for advisement.

"Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) is a defect in the heart’s electrical conduction system in which the right ventricle (one of the dog's four heart chambers) is not directly activated by the electric impulses through the right bundle branch. RBBB may be complete or partial in nature.
"
"Often, no specific symptoms are seen that can be attributed to RBB, only those that are related to the underlying disease causing the defect.
"
"Although it may be present in normal dogs, a right bundle branch block is more often associated with congenital (present at birth) heart disease(s). Other typical causes for the defect include:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically non-specific. However, biochemistry profile may show high levels of potassium.
"
"The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat, or contract, by firing off electrical surges. Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is a disorder of the heart’s electrical impulse formation within the sinus node. It is also a disorder of the conduction of the electrical impulse out of the sinus node. Sick sinus syndrome will also affect subsidiary (backup) pacemakers and the specialized conduction system of the heart. Pacemaker refers to the generation of electrical impulses within the muscle tissue, which set the pace for the heart's rhythm.
"
"On an electrocardiogram (ECG), the irregular contraction of the heart (arrhythmia) will be visible. Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, in which the heart beats too slowly, and then too quickly, is a variant of sick sinus syndrome. Clinical signs of sick sinus syndrome in animals will become apparent when organs begin to dysfunction because they are not receiving a normal amount of blood supply.
"
"This syndrome can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Some dogs will not show any symptoms of sick sinus syndrome, especially if they tend to be fairly inactive under normal circumstances. Generally, the symptoms that will present are:
"
"The causes for this condition are mostly unknown. Some of the suspected relationships to SSS are genetic, since some breeds, like the miniature schnauzer, appear to be predisposed; another cause is heart disease that is cutting off the blood supply to or from the heart and disrupting normal heart function, including the electrical functionality; and, cancer in the thoracic or pulmonary (both refer to the chest) region may also lead to SSS.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel to verify proper organ function. You will need to give your doctor a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history and onset of symptoms, and possible incidents or recent health conditions that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected secondarily.
"
"A provocative atropine response test may be done to assess sinus node function. This test uses the drug atropine to stimulate the firing action (sending electrical impulses out) of the SA Node. Dogs with SSS generally will have no response, or will have an incomplete response to the atropine.
"
"An ECG may be indicated in certain breeds which are predisposed to SSS, as these same breeds are often predisposed to other diseases of the heart valves (the valves that separate the four chambers of the heart).  Hence, if there is a heart murmur, disease of any of the heart’s valves should first be ruled out.
"
"
"
"Only patients showing clinical signs need treatment, and only patients requiring electrophysiologic testing of the heart, or implantation of an artificial pacemaker will need to be hospitalized.
"
"Dogs that do not respond to medical therapy, or have adverse medical side effects to therapy, and/or dogs with abnormally fast/abnormally slow heart rate syndrome will need to have an artificial pacemaker implanted. Attempts to manage an abnormally fast or abnormally slow heart rate syndrome medically, without prior pacemaker implantation, carry a significant risk of worsening the extremes of the abnormally fast or abnormally slow heart rate syndrome.
"
"While your dog is healing from this condition, you will need to keep its physical activity to a minimum. Encourage rest in a quiet, non-stressful environment as much as possible, away from other pets or active children. Although therapy for SSS may seem to work at the beginning of treatment, medical therapy commonly does not work. The only alternative in these instances is surgical correction.
"
"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a rare form of heart muscle disease in dogs. It is characterized by a thickening of the walls of the heart, which leads to an inadequate amount of blood being pumped out into the body when the heart contracts during the systolic phase (pushing blood out into the arteries). When the heart relaxes between contractions during the diastolic phase (taking blood in from the vessels), an insufficient amount of blood will fill the chambers of the heart. Ultimately, HCM often will lead to congestive heart failure.
"
"This disease, although extremely rare to dogs, usually affects young male dogs that are younger than three years old. There is also a higher incidence of the disease in mature Boston Terriers.
"
"Most dogs with HCM will not exhibit any symptoms of the disease. If your dog is symptomatic, it will exhibit signs of congestive heart failure. These include exercise intolerance, shortness of breath, coughing, and a bluish discoloration of the skin. Very rarely, a dog with HCM may experience a transient loss of consciousness, or fainting, during a high level of activity or exercise. During a physical veterinary examination, a dog with HCM may exhibit systolic heart murmur, and a heart gallop. Unfortunately, in most cases, the most commonly reported clinical sign of HCM is sudden, fatal heart failure.
"
"The cause of HCM in dogs is largely unknown. Although some genetic abnormalities in gene codings for certain proteins have been detected in humans and cats with the disease, no such evidence exists for dogs.
"
"Diagnosis of HCM through medical tests is relatively difficult and involves a number of procedures. Radiographic findings may either return normal results, or may show an enlargement of the left ventricular and atrium. If a dog with HCM has left-sided congestive heart failure, there will be a buildup of fluid in the lungs. An electrocardiogram (EKG) will typically reveal normal results as well, but sometimes, it may show abnormal ST segments and T waves. Blood pressure measurements also will usually return normal results. An examination of the heart using echocardiograph (ultrasound of the heart) imaging is required for a confirmed diagnosis of HCM. In dogs with severe HCM, the echocardiograph will reveal thickened left ventricular walls, papillary muscle enlargement, and an enlarged left atrium.
"
"
"
"Treatment for HCM is normally only advised if the dog is experiencing congestive heart failure, severe arrhythmias (abnormal hearth rhythm), or frequent loss of consciousness. If the dog has left-sided congestive heart failure, diuretics and ACE inhibitors will usually be administered. In dogs with arrhythmias, beta adrenergic blockers or calcium channel blockers are used to improve oxygenation of the heart and to bring down the heart rate. Dogs that are not experiencing congestive heart failure due to HCM can usually be treated on an outpatient basis, where exercise restriction and a low sodium diet will be part of the treatment.
"
"Follow-up treatment for HCM will depend largely on how severe the symptoms are. Repeated radiograph and echocardiograph imaging will be needed to follow the progress of the therapy, to watch for advancement of the disease, and to check on whether adjustments to medication are necessary. Because HCM is so rare in dogs, little data is available on the prognosis. If your dog does have congestive heart failure caused by HCM, the prognosis will usually be poor. Survival will depend largely on the extent of the disease. Your veterinarian will be able counsel you on your dog's chances for survival, and on quality of life practices you can put into place for your dog.

"Lots of dogs get heart disease, particularly as they get older. The heart’s primary responsibility is to pump blood throughout the body, and when something goes wrong with such a vital organ the consequences can be serious.
"
"Learning about the common types of heart disease in dogs can help you identify when a problem might be brewing. Dogs with signs of heart disease need to be seen by a veterinarian so they can get the care they need early on when options can work best, and they may need long-term evaluations by a veterinary cardiologist.
"

"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Here are some of the most common types of heart disease in dogs:
"
"Heart Valve Disease–The heart has four valves that keep blood moving in the right direction. When a dog is born with a faulty valve or a valve becomes diseased or damaged, blood flow through the heart becomes turbulent (less smooth). This causes a heart murmur and can eventually lead to congestive heart failure as blood flow becomes less efficient. Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (MMVD) is the most common type of heart valve disease in dogs, and tends to affect older, small-breed dogs.
"
"RBBB is often only found accidentally, perhaps while performing an echocardiogram. In the case of this defect, he or she may identify structural defects in the heart and right-side enlargement. Thoracic and abdominal radiography, meanwhile, may show masses and other abnormalities. If heartworms are the underlying cause, they also may be identified in diagnostic procedures.
"
"
"
"Treatment is directed towards treating underlying cause.
"
"This condition itself is not life-threatening and treating the underlying cause results in complete resolution of problem. However, if left untreated, RBBB can lead to more severe heart rhythm changes or even complete heart block.
"
"You may be required to take your pet for regular follow-ups exams to evaluate the status of disease and the dog's response to treatment. No diet modifications are necessary, unless required to manage underlying condition.

"Myocardial (Heart Muscle) Disease—The heart is made mostly of muscle. If that muscle degenerates and thins, the heart becomes less able to pump blood. This is called dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or HCM,­­ is another type of heart disease that develops when the heart muscle becomes too thick, preventing normal amounts of blood from filling the heart chamber.
"
"Heartworm Disease—Heartworms are spread through the bites of infected mosquitos. Adult heartworms live in the lung’s larger blood vessels and in a dog’s heart. They cause a lot of inflammation and damage and can block the flow of blood from the heart into the lungs.
"
"Arrhythmias—A heart rhythm that is too slow, too fast, or irregular can make it hard for the heart to pump blood to the lungs and rest of the body.
"
"Shunts—Shunts are abnormal vessels or holes in and around the heart that prevent blood from circulating normally. Most cardiac shunts in dogs—such as patent ductus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect—are congenital (present at birth).
"
"Stenosis—Puppies can be born with a narrowed area around their heart valves, making it hard for blood to pass through. Pulmonic stenosis and subaortic stenosis are the most common forms in dogs.
"
"Pericardial Disease—The pericardium is the sac that surrounds the heart. The heart can’t beat effectively if the pericardium becomes stiff or if the area between the pericardium and the heart fills with fluid (usually blood) or air.
"
"Congestive Heart Failure, or CHF—A consequence of many types of heart disease, congestive heart failure develops when the heart can no longer pump blood well enough to meet the needs of the body. Fluid may leak out of blood vessels and collect in or around the lungs, in the abdomen, or within other tissues.
"
"Different types of heart disease can lead to different symptoms, but most dogs have some combination of the following signs of heart disease:
"
"Coughing
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Becoming tired easily
"
"Weakness
"
"Weight loss
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Blue-tinged or gray gums
"
"Abnormal swellings (legs or belly, for example)
"
"Difficulty sleeping
"
"Fainting
"
"Collapse
"
"These signs can also be caused by other types of health problems, such as diseases affecting the lungs, so it’s important to get your dog to the veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis as soon as possible.
"
"Heart disease in dogs is either congenital (present at birth) or acquired (occurs later in life). Symptoms of congenital heart disease usually develop in puppies or young adult dogs, and often genetics plays a big role in determining which dogs are affected.
"
"Signs of acquired heart disease may not be obvious until a dog is middle-aged or older, even though genetics and a dog’s breed are still important determinative factors. Dogs that are overweight may be at higher risk for developing more severe symptoms of heart disease.
"
"Nutrition plays a role in some forms of heart disease. For example, dogs that are fed diets deficient in the amino acid taurine are at an increased risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy. Some breeds, such as Golden Retrievers, appear to have a higher requirement for taurine in their diet.
"
"Recently, a form of dilated cardiomyopathy has been associated with certain types of dog food (boutique, exotic, and grain-free), but taurine deficiency doesn’t appear to be to blame and a cause has not been identified.
"
"The first step in diagnosing heart disease in dogs is a complete physical examination. The veterinarian will use a stethoscope to listen to your dog’s heart and lungs to check for abnormal rhythms and sounds like heart murmurs or crackles (evidence of fluid in the lungs).
"
"Your vet will also feel your dog’s pulse and check for fluid buildup in the abdomen and other tissues. Be prepared to answer questions about your dog’s health history and the symptoms you have been seeing at home. A veterinary cardiologist may also be consulted.
"
"Diagnostic testing for heart disease is usually needed. This may include:
"
"Chest X-rays to look at the heart’s shape and size and to evaluate the lungs and other structures in the chest
"
"Electrocardiogram (ECG) to identify heart rhythm abnormalities
"
"Echocardiogram (an ultrasound exam) to watch how blood flows through the heart and to evaluate heart valves and muscle
"
"Heartworm tests
"
"Blood pressure measurement
"
"Other lab work and diagnostic testing may be necessary, based on the specifics of the dog’s case.
"
"Many treatments are available for heart disease in dogs. Whenever possible, treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Sometimes a heart disease can be cured and a dog’s symptoms may disappear. For example:
"
"Adult heartworms can be eliminated with injections of melarsomine, a derivative of arsenic.
"
"Some types of arrhythmias can be managed with a pacemaker or with surgical interventions.
"
"Surgery may also be an option to correct a cardiac shunt, stenosis, or some types of valvular or pericardial disease.
"
"More commonly, heart disease in dogs is managed with medications that can:
"
"Help the heart to pump more efficiently (enalapril and pimobendan, for example)
"
"Aid in the elimination of excess fluid from the body (furosemide or spironolactone, for example)
"
"Normalize heart rhythm (atenolol, sotalol, propranolol, amiodarone, diltiazem, and digoxin, for example)
"
"Your veterinarian may also recommend modifying your dog’s diet. Weight loss or nutritional supplements (taurine, for example) can help some dogs with heart disease.
"
"Feeding a diet that is low in salt may help reduce fluid retention if a dog has congestive heart failure. Your veterinarian may recommend a prescription diet like Hill's® Prescription Diet h/d Heart Care or Purina® Pro Plan Veterinary Diets CC Cardiocare. Many dogs who developed dilated cardiomyopathy while eating a boutique diet have returned to normal after being switched to more traditional dog foods.
"
"When heart disease is caught early and treated appropriately, dogs often live happily for many more years.
"
"However, severe cases of heart disease or those that have progressed to congestive heart failure bring with them a more guarded prognosis. There usually comes a time when available treatment options can no longer maintain a dog’s quality of life.
"
"Where hemangio refers to the blood vessels and sarcoma a type of aggressive, malignant cancer that arises from the connective tissues of the body, a hemangiosarcoma of the heart is a tumor that originates in the blood vessels that line the heart. This is the most common cardiac tumor seen in dogs. A hemangiosarcoma may originate in the heart, or it may have metastasized to the heart from another location in the body. It is most commonly reported in mid to large size breeds, such as boxers, German shepherds and golden retrievers, and in older dogs – six years and older.
"
"This tumor often will go undetected until complications arise. Because a hemangiosarcoma arises from the blood vessels, when it reaches an unsustainable size it will burst, often resulting in life threatening internal bleeding. Other typical symptoms relate to the size of the tumor interfering with the heart's ability to function. The pumping of blood into or out of the heart organ may be blocked or slowed, resulting in an irregular heart rhythm; the pericardial sac that surrounds the heart may become filled with blood due to burst vessels, or with fluid that places restrictive pressure on the heart; or there may be a responsive abdominal swelling that puts pressure on the heart and other organs. In addition, the blood loss may lead to a regenerative anemia, with concurrent symptoms that can confound the initial diagnosis.
"
"Most symptoms are seen related to complications affecting heart rather than tumor itself.
"
"The exact cause is still unknown
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and any incidents of ill health, behavioral changes, or accidents that have recently taken place. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being primarily affected and which organs are being affected secondarily. Your dog's age, breed, and the outward symptoms that are presenting will be the initial signals for a rough diagnosis.
"
"Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The blood tests may reveal anemia, as often the blood loss will lead to a state of regenerative anemia, where the body is lacking in sufficient red blood cells, but is still capable of producing more of them – though it may not be able to keep with the demand.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to take fluid samples from both the abdomen and the chest, by abdominocentesis and pericardiocentesis respectively, for cytological analysis. This can also be used to remove excess fluid so that your dog is more comfortable. Blood found in the fluid sample is a frequent sign of hemangiosarcoma, and failure of clotting in the blood when it is drawn is another telling indication, since the body is working hard to maintain its blood balance and is using the blood clotting factors too rapidly.
"
"An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Your veterinarian may also need to take a surgical tissue sample of the mass for examination (biopsy).
"
"Visual diagnostic methods, such as x-rays and ultrasound of the thoracic (chest) and abdominal cavities, may reveal variations in cardiac size and structure. Echocardiography is the most valuable tool for making accurate diagnosis. It will confirm the presence of fluid, structural abnormalities in the heart, the presence of a tumor mass or clot, and other aspects of tumors within the heart.
"
"
"
"This tumor is very difficult to treat as it tends to rapidly metastasize to different locations in the body. Treatment involves treating both the primary disease as well as complications that have arisen due to the tumor. Chemotherapy is often recommended for slowing the progression of metastasis, but this alone will not stop the disease spread. Because of the vulnerable nature of the location of this sarcoma, it is often neither practical or even possible to recommend surgery with any hopes of success, but in some cases, if the tumor is limited to one mass on the heart, surgery may be a viable treatment. Your veterinarian may drain the fluid that has accumulated within the thoracic and/or abdominal cavity, and pain medications will be prescribed by your veterinarian to relieve your dog's discomfort.
"
"Heart disease usually does not cause pain, but it can cause other types of suffering like difficulty breathing, constant coughing, and extreme weakness. Veterinary treatment can make dogs with heart disease feel much better.
"
"Small-breed dogs often develop leaky heart valves as they get older. Large-breed dogs are more likely to have problems with heart muscle functioning.

"Unfortunately, this disease has a poor prognosis, and even successful treatments may only add months to your dog's life.
"
"The location of this tumor (heart) makes it especially life-threatening, so the prognosis is very poor in most patients. In almost all cases, tumor metastasis has already taken place into the lungs at the time of diagnosis, making treatment more difficult. Even after surgery, recurrence is common. The life expectancy for affected animals is less than six months.
"
"Watch for symptoms associated with recurrence and involvement of other body sites. If you notice your dog having difficulty breathing, sudden behavioral changes, which may indicate metastasis to the brain, or any other symptoms, call your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will prescribe a pain protocol for your dog, as well as a diet that is especially designed for cancer patients. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines for management of your dog at home.

"Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) is a defect in the heart’s electrical conduction system in which the left ventricle (one of the dog's four heart chambers) is not directly activated by the electric impulses through the left posterior and anterior fascicles of the left bundle branch, causing the deflections in the electrocardiographic tracing (QRS) to become wide and bizarre. LBBB may be complete or partial in nature.
"
"Often, no specific symptoms are seen that can be attributed to LBBB, only those that are related to the underlying disease causing the defect.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically non-specific.
"
"Left bundle branch block is often only found accidentally, perhaps while performing an echocardiogram. In the case of this defect, he or she may identify structural defects in the heart without left-side side enlargement. Thoracic and abdominal radiography may also show masses and other abnormalities, while Holter monitoring may reveal intermittent LBBB.
"
"
"
"Treatment is directed towards treating underlying cause.
"
"This condition itself is not life-threatening and treating the underlying cause results in complete resolution of problem. However, if left untreated, LBBB can lead to more severe heart rhythm changes or even complete heart block.
"
"You may be required to take your pet for regular follow-ups exams to evaluate the status of disease and the dog's response to treatment. No diet modifications are necessary, unless required to manage underlying condition.

"The heart is divided into four chambers. The two upper chambers are the atria (singular: atrium), and two lower chambers are the ventricles. Atrioventricular (AV) valves are present between each atrial and ventricular pair. The valve between the right atrium and right ventricle is the tricuspid valve, while the valve between the left atrium and ventricle is called the mitral valve.
"
"In endocardiosis, excessive fibrous tissue develops in the atrioventricular valves, affecting both the structure and function of the valves. Over a period of time this results in thickening, stiffing, and distortion of the AV valves, ultimately leading to congestive heart failure (CHF). As a result, the heart cannot pump adequate blood to the body, forcing it to work harder to attempt to meet the body's requirements. This cardiac behavior leads to multiple complications, including stiffening of the ventricles due to increased dilation. These changes ultimately lead to heart failure and death in affected dogs.
"
"Commonly, small breeds are at a higher risk. The following breeds show a higher incidence of AV valve endocardiosis: Chihuahuas, Maltese, Pomeranians, cocker spaniels, Pekingese, Cavalier King Charles spaniels, Boston terriers, fox terriers, miniature poodles, miniature schnauzers, miniature pinschers, whippets, and toy poodles.
"
"As this disease is chronic in nature, eventual heart failure is usually seen in older dogs (older than ten years), but mild cardiac abnormalities may be detected in young animals. The incidence rate of AV endocardiosis is slightly higher in male dogs than in female dogs.
"
"Following are some of the symptoms related to atrioventricular valve endocardiosis. Please note that severity and frequency of these symptoms may vary depending upon the severity of the disease itself.
"
"As the disease advances, cough, exercise intolerance, breathing problems and other symptoms become more severe and may occur with more frequency.
"
"Obscure or unknown cause.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected secondarily, especially since heart failure affects all other organs of the body, notably the kidney and liver. After taking a detailed background history from you, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination on your dog. Laboratory testing is of high value in overall diagnostic workup, and will include complete blood tests, biochemical profiling, and urinalysis. These tests will provide important information to your veterinarian for a preliminary diagnosis, as well as information about the current status of the problem.
"
"Further confirmation of the diagnosis may be assured by using X-ray and ultrasound imaging, along with electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography to measure the heart's electrical impulses, and color Doppler to evaluate the blood's ability to flow freely. Together, these diagnostic tools provide vital information about the structure and function of the heart and the extent of the problem your dog is experiencing. Your veterinarian will evaluate the AV valves, as well as the other heart structures, in detail using these techniques. Modern advancements have made it possible to diagnose this condition with relative speed and ease so that treatment can begin in a timely fashion.
"
"
"
"This is a progressive disease with no single treatment plan that will work for all patients. Individualized treatment will be recommended on the basis of your dog's current health status, how far the disease has progressed, and what existing complications need to be treated to stabilize your dog. Your veterinarian will discuss all of the available treatment options with you so that you can make an informed decision on how to progress. In some patients little or no treatment is required, with only regular monitoring, while others may need to be admitted for immediate emergency treatment. In still other patients, extensive medical treatment, or even surgery, may be recommended. Medical treatment will be focused on the primary disease as well as any other complications that need to be addressed immediately. Surgery to replace the defective valve may be attempted for some patients but you may need to search for a surgeon skilled in this specialized surgical technique.
"
"The results of surgery are not promising at present, though the success rate has improved with the advancement of surgery techniques and improved surgery skills in this area of medicine.
"
"Initially, absolute cage rest may be recommended. Once your dog's health has stabilized it may be allowed to have slow leash walks. You will also need to closely observe your dog's behavior, calling your veterinarian as soon as any unusual symptoms or behaviors are noticed.
"
"Due to the progressive nature of this disease, a high level of commitment and care is required on your part for the successful management and treatment of the condition. Your veterinarian will give you a detailed plan for the administration of medications, exercise, diet, and any other vital information for treating your dog at home. Dogs that are affected with atrioventricular valve endocardiosis generally need an individualized sodium restricted diet plan during treatment.
"
"You may need to visit your veterinarian every week during the first month of treatment. At each visit your veterinarian will check your dog's progress with standard laboratory testing, including radiographs and ECG. You will need to familiarize yourself with the drugs that have been prescribed for your dog and be especially vigilant about the time and frequency of dispensing these drugs. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines strictly regarding your dog's at home health management.
"
"Long-term prognosis depends upon many factors, including the age of your dog, the current status of the disease, concurrent diseases, and management.

"Left Anterior Fascicular Block (LAFB) is a heart problem that originates due to an abnormally functioning conduction system, which is responsible for generating electrical impulses (waves) that propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart muscles to contract and pump blood. If the conduction system is affected, not only will contraction of the heart muscles be affected, but the timing and frequency of heartbeats too. Fortunately, this condition is uncommon in dogs.
"
"
There are no specific symptoms related to this condition itself, rather, related to the underlying cause of the LAFB.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which may reveal electrolyte imbalances.
"
"Electrocardiography, however, remains the most important tool for diagnosis. Your veterinarian will record your dog’s electrocardiogram (ECG) and compare it with a normal ECG to see if any abnormalities are present. Further evaluation of the heart is usually done with echocardiography. This helps in the diagnosis of underlying heart disease or problem, and the extent of heart involvement.
"
"Your veterinarian will also take X-rays of both the thoracic and abdominal regions to see if there are any abnormal masses, tumor, foreign body, and/or abnormal heart position.
"
"
"
"The form of treatment recommended for your dog grossly depends on the diagnosis and may vary patient to patient. Therefore, correctly diagnosing the underlying cause of the LAFB is paramount.
"
"Prognosis and follow-up exam schedules varies greatly depending on the underlying disease. However, in cases of severe or advanced heart problems or cancer, prognosis is not good. Consult with your dog's veterinarian in all cases.

"There are four chambers in the heart. The two top chambers are the atria (single: atrium), and two bottom chambers are the ventricles. Under normal circumstances, the heart works with exceptional synchronization between the various atrial and ventricular structures, resulting in a consistent rhythmic pattern. Atrial premature complexes result in an abnormal rhythmic disturbance, where the heart beats prematurely, before the normal timing, or pacing.
"
"Excluding animals born with a congenital heart disease, atrial premature complexes often affect older dogs, especially small-breed dogs. Atrial premature complexes (APCs) can be seen on an electrocardiogram (EKG) as a premature wave called a P wave. This P wave may be biphasic, negative, positive or superimposed on the previous T wave on the EKG.
"
"The P wave on an EKG represents the electrical conduction from the sinoatrial node in the heart to and through the atria of the heart. The QRS complex -- a recording of a single heartbeat on the EKG -- following the P wave represents the passing of this impulse through the heart’s ventricles after it passes through the atrioventricular node. The last wave on an EKG reading is the T wave which measures ventricular recovery (from charging) before the next cardiac contraction.
"
"An increase in automaticity of atrial heart muscle fibers or a single reentrant circuit can cause a premature P wave to occur. These premature atrial beats begin outside of the sinoatrial node (ectopic) -- the pacemaker of the heart -- and disrupt the normal ""sinus"" heart beat rhythm for one or more beats.
"
"Although there may be no symptoms associated with atrial premature complexes, especially in older dogs or in dogs that are normally not very active, some common signs include:
"
"You will need to provide your veterinarian with a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. The full physical exam will include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count and an electrolyte panel.
"
"It is crucial to search for an underlying cause for the heart disease that is bringing about the APCs. An electrocardiogram (EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Other diagnostic tools, like echocardiograph and Doppler ultrasound, can be used to visualize the heart and its performance (rhythms, velocity of contraction).
"
"
"
"The treatment your veterinarian administers will depend on exactly what kind of heart disease is affecting your pet and how severe it is. There are several different types of medicines that can be used, depending on the type of heart disease present. For congestive heart failure, a diuretic may be prescribed, and a drug to dilate the blood vessels (vasodilator). Digitoxin may be prescribed to decrease the heart rate and increase cardiac contractility.
"
"A normal heart contraction is caused by an electrical impulse originating from the sinoatrial node, stimulating the atria, traveling to the atrioventricular node and finally to the ventricles. First-degree atrioventricular block is a condition in which the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles is delayed, or prolonged. On an electrocardiogram (EKG) this shows as a prolonged PR interval -- the time between the main electrical impulse, called the P wave, and the QRS complex, which is recognized as the heart beat.
"
"First-degree AV block may be found in young, healthy dogs due to a high vagal tone (impulses from the vagus nerve that produce an inhibition in the heart beat), and it is also often noted in elderly Cocker Spaniels and Dachshunds with degenerative conduction system disease.
"
"Most dogs with this condition will not show signs of the condition. However, if induced by digoxin (heart medication) overdose, there may be a loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea.
"
"Although it may occur in otherwise healthy dogs, Dachshunds and Cocker Spaniels are known to be more prone to first-degree AV block. Additionally, prescription medication such as digoxin, bethanechol, physostigmine, and pilocarpine, may predispose animals to first-degree AV block. Some other common causes for the condition include:
"
"In addition to the full physical exam, your veterinarian will take a complete background history of your dog's health, when the symptoms began and any other symptoms that may point your doctor to the underlying cause. Standard tests include a chemical blood profile and a complete blood count to check for imbalances or infections.
"
"An echocardiogram (EKG) will be conducted to rule out certain types of heart diseases, and X-ray or ultrasound imaging can be used for internal imaging of the heart, confirming the presence of masses, or ruling them out. Gastrointestinal disorders, high pressure in the eye and upper airway disease are some of the diseases that can lead this disorder, all of which are unrelated (directly) to the heart.
"
"An EKG recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal the exact abnormalities that are taking place in the cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat).
"
"
"
"Depending on the underlying disease causing the atrioventricular block, treatment will vary.
"
"Your veterinarian will prescribe diet guidelines as necessary to treat the underlying cause of the disease. You will need to follow-up with your veterinarian for regular appointments so that any changes can be addressed immediately. EKGs will be taken at each visit to follow the progress of the heart's ability to conduct properly.

"Underlying cardiac diseases must be treated and kept as controlled as possible by your veterinarian. This means that you will need to take your dog to the veterinarian for frequent follow-up appointments. Sometimes, despite drug therapy, some animals will have an increased frequency of APCs, or will deteriorate to more severe signs of heart disease as the underlying disease progresses.
"
"Depending on the underlying cardiac disease, you may need to change your dog's diet to a low sodium diet. You will also need to change your daily routine with your dog, with less physical exertion so that the heart does not need to work hard. Your veterinarian will advise you on the diet and amount of activity your dog will need to be of optimum health.

"The heart's sinoartial node (SA) is very much like a control center, responsible for controlling the heart rate. This electrical conduction system generates electrical impulses (waves), which propagate through the atrioventricular (AV) node and into the ventricles, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body.
"
"Complete, or third-degree, atrioventricular block is a condition in which all impulses generated by the SA node are blocked at the AV node, leading to independent and non-coordinated beating of atria and ventricles.
"
"Cocker spaniels, Pugs, and Doberman breeds are predisposed to heart defects leading to complete heart block. Third-degree atrioventricular block also occurs in older dogs more frequently.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Dogs suffering from infections of the heart will demonstrate high white blood cell count on blood testing, while biochemistry profile may reveal electrolyte imbalances.
"
" 
"
"Your veterinarian will record the electrocardiograph, or ECG, which is extremely beneficial to make an initial diagnosis. Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound are performed in animals with abnormal ECG finding, and those with symptoms associated with heart issues.
"
"
"
"The ultimate goal of therapy is to clear the blockage of electrical impulses at the AV node. To achieve this, a special device called a pacemaker is used to resolve the electrical impulse conduction problems and normalize the heart's beating. (Chest x-rays are taken to confirm the proper placement of pacemaker.) Both temporary and permanent pacemakers are available, and your veterinarian will recommend which will work best for your dog. The blockage can be rectified surgically too, but this is often riskier for the dog.
"
"If your dog has had a pacemaker implanted, he will require extra care as well as cage rest. Typically, permanent pacemakers are placed in a pocket created surgically under the skin. To prevent the pacemaker from moving, a bandage is applied over the surgical wound for three to five days. Because pacemakers are battery operated, a malfunction can occur at any time; the pacemaker may also become infected, dislodged, or run out of battery. In such cases, the dog's heart may again go into a complete atrioventricular block. Therefore, it is vital that you restrict the dog's movements and monitor him for untoward symptoms.
"
"Depending on the severity of the underlying disease, the dog's diet may require modifying. In addition, you will need to visit your veterinarian at regular intervals for ECG and chest radiography, which are used to assess proper pacemaker function. Unfortunately, long term prognosis of dogs with complete atrioventricular block is very poor.

"Atrial standstill is a rare heart rhythm disturbance characterized by abnormal ECG (electrocardiogram) findings. Specifically, the ECG identifies missing P-waves, a measure of the electrical activity in the atria, the top two chambers in the dog's heart.
"
"Atrial standstill can be temporary, persistent, or terminal (due to complications such as heart failure) and is most commonly seen in English springer spaniels. Along with absent P-waves, the ECG of the dog may demonstrate a slow heart rate with regular or irregular rhythm.
"
"Although routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, are conducted on the animal, often atrial standstill is confirmed through ECG (electrocardiogram) findings. Other common findings include abnormally high levels of potassium and sodium in the blood -- both of which are only found with a biochemistry profile. These results may also indicate abnormalities related to other concurrent diseases. Echocardiography, meanwhile, will help your veterinarian diagnose the type of heart disease and the severity of the issue.
"
"  
"
"
"
"In some dogs, atrial standstill is not a life-threatening condition and no hospitalization is required. However, in others it may be serious enough to require immediate intensive care. Such animals typically have an abnormally high blood potassium level or are suffering from severe dehydration. In these cases, intravenous fluid therapy is used to stabilize the animal. If the dog's heart rhythm cannot be rectified by ordinary means, a pacemaker may be surgically implanted into the chest or abdomen. This small medical device helps control the abnormal heart atria activity.
"
"The prognosis of the dog depends on the underlying disease causing the heart rhythym disturbance. If it is corrected quickly and (when present) hyperkalemia is reversed, the long-term prognosis is excellent.
"
"The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat, or contract, by firing off electrical surges. The atria, the two upper chambers of the heart that receive  and send out blood, are prompted into action by the SA node's electrical impulse, which then activates the atrioventricular node (AV node). The AV node conducts the normal electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, coordinating the mechanical activity so that the atria have forced the blood down into the ventricles before the ventricles contract to send the blood out into the body through the pulmonary artery and aortic artery.
"
"Second-degree atrioventricular block occurs when the electrical conduction within the AV node is delayed. 
"
"Most dogs with this condition show no signs, appearing to be in perfect health. The condition is also rarely noted in geriatric cocker spaniels and dachshunds due to fibrosis.  Low calcium levels and certain drugs (e.g., digoxin, bethanechol, physostigmine, pilocarpine) may predispose some animals to second-degree AV block–Mobitz Type 1.  Second-degree AV block–Mobitz Type 1 can also be brought about by diseases unrelated to the heart.
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a full physical exam, with a chemical blood profile and a complete blood count. A thorough history from you will allow your veterinarian to rule out masses, gastrointestinal disorders, high pressure in the eye and upper airway disease. X-rays may help detect some of these disorders as well. An atropine response test, which increases the firing action of the sinoatrial node and the conduction of the AV node will indicate if the disease is originating from the heart. 
"
"Your dog will require rest in a stress-free environment, away from other pets and active children, to help control the symptoms of persistent atrial standstill. Even with a pacemaker, however, the symptoms of lethargy and weakness may persist. Dogs with pacemakers also require regular follow-up exams and periodic ECGs to monitor the effectiveness of the device and the heart's rhythm.

"A dog's heart is divided into four chambers. The two top chambers are the atria (singular: atrium), and the bottom chambers are the ventricles. The heart has an electrical conduction system that is responsible for controlling the heart rate. This electrical conduction system generates electrical impulses (waves), which propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body. There are two nodes (masses of tissue) present in the heart that play an important role in this conduction system. The sinus node, or sinoatrial (SA) node, is a clustered collection of similar cells located in the right atrium, its purpose being to generate electrical impulses and to serve as the heart's pacemaker. The other node is called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Like the SA node, it is a clustered collection of similar cells situated in the right atrium, close to the ventricle. The AV node receives impulses from the SA node, and after a small delay, directs the impulses to the ventricles. This delay allows for the atrium to eject blood into the ventricle before the ventricular muscles contract. The AV node can also take the place of the SA node as the heart's pacemaker, should the SA node be affected adversely by a pathological condition of the heart.
"
"Second degree AV block in dogs is a disease in which the above mentioned electrical conduction system goes off course, as some impulses are not passed down from the atria to the ventricles, thus impairing contraction and pumping functions of the heart muscles. AV block is rare in healthy dogs, but older dogs are at higher risk. American cocker Spaniels, pugs, and dachshund breeds are known to be predisposed to second degree AV block.
"
"Some dogs may remain asymptomatic while others may show the following symptoms:
"
"In case of digoxin intoxication  (a drug used to treat many cardiac diseases and which is sometimes over-dosed), an animal may show the following symptoms:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. A previous illness or treatment history is important in these cases. After performing a complete physical examination, your veterinarian will measure your dog's arterial blood pressure to check for hypertension (high blood pressure) related to cardiac disease. Laboratory tests include the standard complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These tests are of importance in the diagnosis of this problem as there are some biochemical changes that can predispose your dog to AV block. For example, if digoxin toxicity is suspected, the level of digoxin will be measured in your dog's serum. More specific tests may be conducted to evaluate the presence of infectious disease or parasitism. Blood culture/sensitivity tests will show evidence of a type of organism that is involved in infection and its sensitivity to various antibiotics.
"
"Other diagnostic tools that are important for the evaluation of the heart's structural and functional parameters include electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography for measuring the heart's electrical impulses.
"
"
"
"This disease is not aggressively treated in dogs. If the heart rate is being maintained at a level at which the heart can pump an adequate amount of blood for normal body functions, generally no treatment will be required. If an underlying disease is responsible for the AV block, your veterinarian will treat it accordingly.
"
"There is no special nursing care that is required for these patients. If symptoms persist, strict cage rest is often recommended. Your veterinarian may also recommend a special diet for your dog if there is an underlying disease that will benefit from dietary restrictions. It should be noted that if an underlying cause is responsible for the AV block, it will need to be treated in order to resolve the problem. You will need to ask your veterinarian about various options available for treatment.
"
"In some cases medication is not enough for long-term treatment of this problem. For such persistent cases, a permanent pacemaker (a small device that is placed under the skin of your dog’s thoracic [chest] cavity to help control abnormal heart rhythms) is required for long-term management. You may need to visit your veterinarian frequently for evaluation of your dog’s current cardiac health status and progress, as this problem can lead to further serious complications if it is not monitored regularly.

"A dog's heart is divided into four chambers. The two top chambers are called the atria (single: atrium) whereas the bottom chambers are called the ventricles. Valves are provided between each atrial and ventricular pair, each on the left and right side. The valve between the right atrium and right ventricle is called the tricuspid valve, where the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle is called the mitral valve. The heart works with exceptional synchronization between the various atrial and ventricular structures, resulting in a consistent rhythmic pattern.
"
"In both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter this rhythm is disturbed and synchronization is lost between the atria and ventricles. Both conditions refer to a rhythm problem that originates in the upper chambers of the heart, that is, the atria. Atrial flutter is often a precursor to atrial fibrillation. In atrial flutter there is a premature electrical impulse that arises in the atria, resulting in a faster than normal heart rate, either regular or irregular in frequency, whereas in atrial fibrillation there is quivering type of contraction of the heart muscles, resulting in a rapid and abnormally paced heart rhythm, also referred to as arrhythmia. In atrial fibrillation the atria beat chaotically, resulting in irregular rhythms of the ventricle as well. Atrial fibrillation can occur with or without underlying heart disease. On an electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of the heart, a distinct pattern can be differentiated in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
"
"Atrial fibrillation is categorized by relevance, including:
"
"The symptoms generally relate to an underlying disease like congestive heart failure (CHF). Following are few of the symptoms related to atrial fibrillation.
"
"After taking a detailed history from you, including your dog's background health history and onset of symptoms, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination. Laboratory tests include a complete blood profile, with a biochemical profile, complete blood count, and urinalysis. It is possible that the results of these tests may not reveal much information related to this disease, but they may be helpful for accessing an overall picture of your dog's health and reveal other diseases, if present. Additional diagnostic tools include echocardiography (ECG), X-ray imaging, and color Doppler to help in characterizing the type and severity of any underlying heart disease.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will first diagnose the level of flutter or fibrillation your dog is experiencing, and whether there is an underlying disease of the heart, such as CHF, that is responsible for the atrial arrhythmia. If the heart is beating too rapidly, your dog will be treated medically for the rhythm to be slowed down. If no underlying disease is found to be present, the treatment will be directed towards normalizing the rhythm of heart and getting the sinoatrial node back into sync with the atrioventricular node (AV) node. If the fibrillation is a chronic problem (more than four months), the success rate drops accordingly and problem recurrence is common in these cases. Electrical shock therapy may be used to normalize the rhythm is some cases. If underlying cardiac disease like CHF is present, the treatment will also be directed towards its treatment, along with stabilizing the heart rhythm.
"
"Follow your veterinarian’s guidelines regarding diet, exercise, rest, medication, and management of your dog's health at home. In cases of primary atrial fibrillation, recurrence can occur, especially in patients with chronic problems. Observe your dog’s health and call your veterinarian if you notice any symptoms that appear out of the ordinary. In cases of severe cardiac diseases like CHF, a high level of commitment and care will be required on your part for the treatment and management of your dog's at home treatment. Keeping a diary of all events and staying in touch with your veterinarian throughout the treatment period will help you to follow your dog's progress and notice any problems as soon as they occur.

"A heart attack refers to a disruption of blood flow to the coronary arteries, the vessels that give blood to the heart muscle itself. Without blood flow, the heart muscle, known as myocardium, is quickly damaged and the heart is unable to do its job of sending blood throughout the body and organs.
"
"Heart attacks are very rare in dogs, but if your pet is showing any signs of pain, weakness, or trouble breathing, seek veterinary care immediately.
"
"Heart attacks occur if there is a disruption, such as a clot, that blocks the blood supply to the heart muscle. Without blood flow, the heart muscle is unable to contract and provide the needed circulation to the rest of the pet’s body. While a heart attack is possible in dogs, it happens very rarely.
"
"Heart failure is much more common in dogs. The heart functions as a pump to push blood to all parts of the body. Any condition that results in the weakening of the pump—such as degeneration of the heart valves over time, damage from heartworms, or a birth defect of the heart—can result in heart failure.
"
"A dog in heart failure will have fluid build up in either his lungs or his abdomen, depending upon which side of his heart is most affected. Heart failure is also a medical emergency, so any coughing, increase in breathing rate or effort, or swelling in the abdomen should be checked by a veterinarian immediately.
"
"If your dog is having a heart attack, you may see these signs:
"
"Loss of consciousness
"
"Unable to move legs
"
"Rapid or labored breathing
"
"Extreme weakness or lethargy (tiredness)
"
"In a dog, any condition that increases the chance of too much blood clotting (hypercoagulability) could cause a heart attack. Conditions that can cause hypercoagulability include:
"
"Diabetes
"
"Cushing’s disease
"
"Severe pancreatitis
"
"Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA)
"
"Sepsis
"
"Parvovirus
"
"Heartworm disease
"
"Cancer
"
"If a heart attack was a concern, radiographs (X-rays) of the chest, blood pressure measurements, an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check heart rhythm, and an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) may be considered, as well as blood tests to check for infections, organ function, or clotting abnormalities.
"
"Since heart attacks are not common in dogs, baseline tests would typically be started to look for more common and treatable causes.
"
"Ultimately, treatment would depend on the underlying condition that caused the heart muscle to lose blood flow. Prognosis for a true heart attack in a dog is very poor, with most dogs not surviving.
"
"A dog’s chance of recovery from a heart attack is low. It would depend on how much heart muscle was able to continue working and the severity of the underlying condition that was causing clots.
"
"If a heart attack is suspected, veterinary care should be given as soon as possible.
"
"There is not a known breed predisposition.
"
"With any true heart attack, survival time for a dog would be quite limited. Many conditions can present similarly, however, so it is important to seek veterinary care immediately if you suspect your pet is having a heart issue.

"Chemodectomas are generally benign tumors that grow from the chemoreceptor tissue of the body. These are the tissues that are most sensitive to chemical changes in the body, such as oxygen content and pH levels in the blood. While chemoreceptor tissues can be located throughout the body, chemodectomas mainly affect the chemoreceptor organs: the aorta and the carotid organs (i.e., heart and carotid artery).
"
"Chemodectomas are relatively uncommon in dogs, but there does appear to be some breed and age predilection. Boxers and Boston Terriers, especially those over the age of ten, are most commonly affected. In addition, males tend to be more predisposed to aortic body tumors, while carotid body tumors show no gender predilection.
"
"Aortic body tumors occur on the aortic artery near the base of the heart. They are rarely of a malignant nature; they will grow within the space but not spread to the surrounding organs. These tumors become a health concern when their growth displaces the trachea, when they grow into the adjacent vessels, or when their growth places pressure on the atria or vena cava, impairing their functionality for conveying blood to the body and heart. Symptoms associated with aortic body tumors include:
"
"Carotid body tumors, meanwhile, occur on the common carotid artery near the point of bifurcation -- where the artery splits into the internal and external carotid arteries. These arteries carry oxygenated blood to the head and neck, and are located in the neck. Because of this relation to the major arterial passages, carotid body tumors are often impossible to remove. In the majority of cases, these tumors remain slow growing but benign, and as with aortic tumors, they become a health issue when they invade the spaces of the adjacent blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. In an estimated 30 percent of cases, metastasis may occur into the surrounding organs, such as the lungs, bronchia or lymph nodes, or further into the liver or pancreas. Symptoms associated with carotid body tumors include:
"
"Other symptoms seen in dogs affected by either body tumor type include:
"
"It is suspected that chronic lack of oxygen may be involved in chemodectoma development. This may explain why flat-faced (brachycephalic) breeds develop it more often. It is further suspected that environment my play a role in the growth of the tumor, as high altitudes may exacerbate lack of oxygen (hypoxemia) in disposed breeds.
"
"After performing a thorough physical exam on your dog and taking a complete medical history from you, your veterinarian will order a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel. The results of these tests will give some indication of the whether the cancer has spread in the body. If hemorrhaging is occurring, anemia may be present, and if metastasis is taking place, higher than normal liver enzymes may be present in the bloodstream.
"
"Chest X-rays will be used to identify the location of the mass and to check for cancer spread to the lungs or spine. A heart ultrasound will also be performed, and if heart impairment is suspected, an electrocardiogram (EKG) may be used to measure the heart’s ability to conduct electrical signals. If possible, a tissue sample will be taken from the mass for biopsy. This will provide a definite diagnosis.
"
" 
"
"Unfortunately, the prognosis for dogs with either of these types of tumors is grim. It is often very difficult to remove these tumors, and they will continue to grow until functioning of the surrounding vessels of organs is impaired to the point of cardiac arrest or organ failure. Cancer treating therapies, such as radiotherapy, can sometimes be used along with surgery to slow down the spread of these cancers.
"
"Aortic stenosis refers to the narrowing of the aortic valve, which controls the blood flow from the left ventricle (one of the dog's four heart chambers) to the aorta ventricular outflow tract. This obstruction puts undue pressure on the heart, causing heart muscle cells to increase in size to maintain forward blood flow and subsequent thickening of the heart wall.
"
"Aortic stenosis is congenital (present at birth) in nature, often found in large breeds such as the Newfoundland, German shepherd, golden retriever, rottweiler, and boxer. It is also the second most common congenital heart defect in dogs. 
"
"There are three types of three types of aortic stenosis: valvular (present at the valve), subvalvular (present below the valve), or supravalvular (present above the valve). The defect typically develops over the first few weeks to months of life; however, symptoms may appear at any age, depending on the severity of obstruction. Some of the more common symptoms include:
"
"In most cases, dogs are born with the this heart defect. However, some develop the aortic obstruction due to bacterial endocarditis.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, often revealing abnormal heart sounds (murmurs), an indication of irregular heart valve function. However, murmurs are are not always a sign of disease, especially in young animals, as they may occur due to pain, fever, or excitement. Your veterinarian will correlate the findings with other symptoms to determine if the murmur is abnormal. 
"
" 
"
"The veterinarian may also conduct several laboratory tests, including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, though the results are usually normal. Chest X-rays, meanwhile, may reveal an enlarged heart, especially on the left side of the organ. And in dogs with congestive heart failure, abnormalities may be detected in the lungs.
"
"For a more detailed evaluation of the heart and related structures, the veterinarian may use echocardiography, which may reveal thickening of the left ventricle wall and aortic valve. In some dogs, echocardiography may reveal a dilated aorta due to stenosis, resulting in abnormal blood flow.
"
"To determine the pressure of blood flow, more advanced tests like cardiac catheterization are used. This involves inserting a catheter into dog's heart chamber or vessel.
"
"
"
"The treatment and management guidelines are controversial and vary among experts. However, most agree the aim of therapy is to treat the complications related to the defect. To truly “cure” the dog, open heart surgery is required to repair (valvuloplasty) or replace the valve. However, the prognosis of dogs that undergo surgery is not favorable, and therefore not usually attempted.
"
"Catherization may also be used to widen the narrowed vessels, but the procedure does not demonstrate survival advantages for dogs with severe forms of the disease.
"
"Your dog will need to be re-evaluated by your veterinarian at least every three months for chest X-rays, as well as a physical exam to monitor for recurrence or spread of the cancer.

"Typically, broad spectrum antibiotics are given to dogs with aortic stenosis due to the increased risk of developing bacterial infections in the heart.
"
"The overall goal for you and the veterinarian is to minimize the dog's symptoms, prevent complications, and improve its quality of life. Activity should be immediately restricted to prevent complications (sometimes fatal) due to overexertion. Low sodium diets will also be recommended for dogs with congestive heart failure.
"
"Affected animals shouldn’t allow breeding or preferably neutered. You’ll need to closely watch your dog at home for abnormal signs and inform the veterinarian immediately if and when they occur. Dogs with mild forms of aortic stenosis may live a “normal” lifespan without any treatment. However, those with severe forms of the defect have a poor prognosis, even with treatment. Regardless of the severity, many veterinarians will recommend against breeding an animal with this heart defect.

"Aortic thromboembolism, also referred to as saddle thrombus, is a common heart condition which results from a blood clot dislodging within the aorta, leading to the interruption of blood flow to tissues served by that segment of the aorta. The largest artery in the body, the aorta distributes oxygenated blood to many parts of the body, including the legs, kidneys, intestines, and brain. Therefore, complications arising in the aorta can be very serious.
"
"Aortic thromboembolism is rare in dogs in comparison with cats.
"
"You will need to give the veterinarian a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, urinalysis, and biochemistry profile -- which may show abnormally high creatine kinase enzyme level due to muscle damage. Moreover, the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase are typically found in dogs with aortic thromboembolism due to muscle and liver damage.
"
"Dogs under stress may have abnormally high level of glucose in the blood. Mild increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine may also be present due to low cardiac output and possibly due to presence of blood clot in a kidney. In some dogs, electrolytes imbalances as well as low levels of calcium and sodium and high levels of phosphate and potassium may be present.
"
"Chest X-rays, meanwhile, commonly show an abnormal enlargement of the heart and a collection of fluid within the lungs and in the pleural cavity. In rare cases, the X-rays may reveal a tumor in the lungs. Abdominal ultrasounds may help your veterinarian identify the exact location of the blood clot, and echocardiography will confirm an abnormal enlarging of the heart, which is a common cause for aortic thromboembolism.
"
"
"
"Most dogs with this condition require immediate intensive care and hospitalization to prevent complete heart failure. Hospitalization is also necessary to minimize the stress and pain associated with this disease. Dogs with breathing problems require oxygen therapy to reduce the stress of rapid breathing and to allow achieving required levels of oxygen in the blood.
"
"Thrombolytics medications, which are used to dissolve the blood, are essential for treatment. Dogs that do not respond to conventional treatment, however, will require surgery to remove the blood clot. Your veterinarian will also give pain killers to reduce the severe pain associated with this disease.
"
"Unfortunately, the prognosis for most dogs with aortic thromboembolism is not good. Even with treatment, clots can again develop and block the aorta. If blood supply to the legs are not restored quickly, permanent muscular abnormalities may develop in the affected limb.
"
"Dogs recovering from aortic thromboembolism should not be allowed to move and should be placed in a stress-free environment, away from other pets and active children. Severe pain is a common symptom associated with this disease and many dogs find it difficult to urinate due to problems with their posture. You may need to gently press your dog's bladder to assist in urination. In addition, most affected dogs find it difficult to eat and may require new foods to tempt the palate. This lack of appetite (anorexia) may lead to further complications. Seek your veterinarian's advice for dietary changes.
"
"Lastly, closely monitor your dog and watch for bleeding, which may occur due to the type of medications frequently used in the treatment of this disease. If you observe any sort of bleeding, immediately call your veterinarian.
"
"To monitor the progress of treatment, frequent checkups and laboratory tests will be required. If the dog does not respond to treatment, your veterinarian may recommend euthanizing the animal due to the severe complications.

"Happy tail syndrome is a condition where dogs cause damage to the tip of their tails from striking surfaces. Many times, this condition occurs when they are wagging their tail, which is why it’s coined happy tail syndrome.
"
"This condition is anything but happy for dogs and pet parents. The tip of the dog’s tail becomes dried and cracked and starts bleeding because of the repetitive striking of the tail on surfaces.
"
"Happy tail becomes painful for the dog and often frustrating for you to help treat, repair, and manage the condition. In the long term, this condition can lead to infection and nerve damage. In many cases, the tail must be amputated to prevent the dog from banging it on hard surfaces.
"
"Usually, large breed dogs with powerful, skinny tails are prone to this condition. Vets often see this condition in Pit Bulls, Shepherds, Great Danes, and Greyhounds, but any breed can develop happy tail.
"
"Many times, pet parents will notice a few drops of blood in their home and then search the dog for a wound. Some pet parents may notice hair loss and a cracked tail tip before it starts to bleed. Dogs otherwise behave normally, eating, drinking, urinating, and defecating as usual.
"
"Happy tail can occur due to the following:
"
"Excessive tail wagging and hitting hard surfaces around the home
"
"Following a stay at a boarding facility or another tight space where they can easily bang their tail
"
"Damage to the tail from fences, walls, doorways, and furniture
"
"Most veterinarians can diagnose happy tail syndrome based on symptoms and breed. However, your vet may want to do some routine bloodwork to make sure there are no signs of anemia or low platelets, or do specialized testing for clotting. Your veterinarian may also recommend checking liver and kidney function, and longer-term use of anti-inflammatory medications.
"
"Happy tail can be frustrating to treat medically, and many dogs do require surgery to amputate the tail to a length that they can no longer bang it into surfaces. Your veterinarian may try other therapies before recommending amputation.
"
"They will apply a bandage to the tail to stop the bleeding and provide a layer of padding to the tail tip. The other main component to the healing process, and to hopefully prevent the need for amputation, is to stop the dog from vigorously wagging its tail. Sedative medications can allow time for the tail to heal. This could take a few weeks to a few months. It will take longer to heal if the dog continues to traumatize the tip of the tail.
"
"Your vet will most likely prescribe a combination of pain medication, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics. Some veterinarians may recommend adding Omega 3 fatty acids or applying topical vitamin A or E oil to prevent cracking.
"
"They may also recommend the longer-term application of a specialized tail sling such as Happy Tail Saver. Some veterinarians and pet parents will try to use pool noodles and other repurposed items to provide padding. Because of the discomfort associated with happy tail and this bulky item attached to their tails, many dogs will want to chew off the items, which can lead to the bigger issue of a foreign body stuck in the intestines. The use of an e-collar can prevent the dog from getting the bandage off, continuing to lick or bite at the tail tip, and possibly eating the bandage.
"
"One would think that dogs stop banging their tails once it starts to hurt; however, dogs use their tail as a part of their body language to convey emotions to other animals and people. All too often, these dogs require surgical amputation to shorten the length of the tail so that they cannot swing it with enough force to cause trauma.
"
"In some cases, a dog may only have one incident of Happy Tail, especially if it occurred while in a tighter space such as a boarding facility or kennel situation. You may find that the tail heals after the first few bouts of happy tail, but this condition can become very frustrating if it reoccurs and ultimately ends with an amputation.  
"
"How long it takes for the tail to heal each time depends on many factors, including prevention of further trauma. If the tip of the tail is not healing after a couple of weeks with sedatives and bandaging, then your veterinarian may want to recheck it.
"
"Many times, owners become frustrated and elect tail amputation to prevent further trauma, pain, and possible infection. Surgery healing time is similar to that of a spay or neuter, and dogs do very well after a tail amputation. Even though the tail is an important part of their personality and showing emotions, they will still be their normal, happy selves without the bleeding and pain.
"
"You can sometimes treat mild cases of happy tail at home. There are balm-type products that can help moisturize the tip of the tail to help prevent cracking and bleeding. Because there is minimal tissue on the tail, bandages can easily cut off circulation and cause harm, so it is best to leave bandaging to your veterinary staff.
"
"Once the tip of the tail cracks open and starts bleeding, happy tail does hurt. Over time, this condition becomes more painful for the dog, and they can start to self-mutilate the tip of their tail or increase the potential for infection by licking.
"
"Happy tail is a painful condition that needs pain medication and sedatives to stop the process and allow the tip of the tail to heal. If the tail does not heal, many times veterinarians and pet parents choose tail amputation to prevent further trauma.

"If your dog’s head tilt lasts longer than 24 hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as vomiting or falling over, they should be seen by a veterinarian immediately.
"
"Dogs naturally tilt their heads when concentrating on sounds, such as your voice, or to hear sounds more clearly. It may also be a sign that your dog is interested in what they hear.
"
"However, excessive head tilting can be a symptom of several issues that should be checked by a veterinarian. Head tilt in dogs is usually due to a condition in the peripheral vestibular system that’s located in the middle ear.
"
"In many situations, head tilting in dogs is most serious within the first 48 hours, especially when the cause is unknown. If the underlying cause is not severe, dogs with head tilt and stumbling often improve over 7-10 days, though some symptoms, such as wobbling, may persist.
"
"Here’s what you should look for and the possible causes and treatment of head tilting in dogs.
"
"Your dog may avoid walking or standing, and in many cases, will lean (or even drop) in the same direction as the head tilt. If you see any of the following signs along with head tilting, take your dog to the vet:
"
"Vomiting
"
"Disorientation, leaning, and/or circling
"
"Confusion
"
"Fatigue
"
"Loss of balance, poor coordination, stumbling, falling over
"
"Not wanting to or hesitating to stand or walk
"
"Eye shifting from side to side
"
"Deafness or difficulty hearing
"
"Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians.
"
"Many cases of head tilt in dogs can be traced back to the vestibular system in the middle ear. This system is responsible for helping your dog maintain their balance, posture, and head position, and it also influences eye movement.
"
"Here are the most common causes of dog head tilt:
"
"Vestibular disease:
"
"Peripheral vestibular disease: If the ear is damaged, such as a punctured eardrum (tympanum), a dog may tilt their head. This can also be caused by some antibiotics (often containing aminoglycosides) and ear washes, such as those containing chlorhexidine, as well as infections that affect the middle and inner ear. The central and inner ear are inflamed due to bacterial, parasitic, or other types of infection.
"
"Central vestibular disease: This is usually caused by cancer, stroke, inflammation, or infection to the brain.
"
"Idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease: Idiopathic means that the exact cause is unknown. This is common in senior dogs (10-12 years old) and involves the middle or inner ear.
"
"Hypothyroidism: The thyroid gland does not produce enough of the thyroid hormone, causing the metabolism to slow. Hypothyroidism can cause peripheral vestibular syndrome, accompanied by head tilting.
"
"Nutritional deficiency: Deficiencies in nutrients such as thiamine can cause dogs to tilt their heads.
"
"Your veterinarian will do a physical exam, paying particular attention to your dog’s ears. Depending on the suspected underlying cause, they may recommend several tests, including:
"
"Complete blood count (CBC)
"
"Urinalysis and electrolyte panel
"
"Nutritional status
"
"Imaging tests, such as x-rays, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MRI), to determine issues within the middle ear
"
"Cerebrospinal fluid test if inflammation or infection is suspected within the brain. CSF is the watery liquid that surrounds and cushions the brain and spinal cord.
"
"Bone biopsy if a tumor or infection of the bone is suspected
"
"Head tilting in dogs is sometimes temporary and resolves on its own. However, it can be caused by a serious underlying condition and result in injury due to falling. Have your dog examined as soon as possible.
"
"Treating head tilting depends on the underlying cause, including:
"
"Treatments for stroke, cancer, or serious injury
"
"Antibiotics for an ear infection
"
"Hormone or nutritional support for hypothyroidism or poor nutrition
"
"If the cause is unknown, no treatment other than supportive care is recommended
"
"Supportive treatment depends on the severity of head tilting and its related symptoms:
"
"Hospitalization with IV fluids until head tilting and related symptoms (such as disorientation or poor coordination) subside.
"
"Sedatives
"
"Anti-nausea medication and drugs to counteract motion sickness, especially in mild to moderate cases.
"
"A dog with a more serious underlying disorder may not improve, or symptoms may worsen, in which case, advanced testing will be recommended.

"Atherosclerosis is a condition in which lipids (the oily substance that is part of the cell structure), fatty materials, such as cholesterol, and calcium collect along the walls of the arteries (blood vessels that carry oxygen-enriched blood). This buildup is referred to as plaque, and over time results in loss of elasticity, and a narrowing of the lumen (the inner space) of the affected arteries. Over time the deposited fatty material thickens, hardens, and ultimately blocks the arteries, or, it may rupture, causing blood clots to form and travel to other parts of the body. Clots in the arteries of the legs may result in trouble with walking. Generally this condition is uncommon in dogs but has been reported in certain breeds, including the Doberman pinscher, poodle, miniature schnauzer, and Labrador.
"
"Risk factors for this disease include age, dogs older than nine years old are at higher risk, and gender. In this case, the male dogs are at higher risk for developing atherosclerosis. The presence of diabetes also plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis.
"
"Following are some of the symptoms related to atherosclerosis in dogs:
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will conduct a blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. For the diagnosis of atherosclerosis other more specific tests may be required depending upon the underlying cause of atherosclerosis. Radiography and ultrasound imaging are also very useful diagnostic tools that can be used to evaluate the heart, liver and other organs. Electrocardiography (ECG) can be used to assess the structure and functional parameters of the heart.
"
"
"
"After careful investigations, the underlying cause of the atherosclerosis will be determined by your veterinarian. It is important to treat both the atherosclerosis and the underlying cause for a better outcome. High cholesterol levels play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis, so your dog may need cholesterol-lowering drugs. Similarly if your dog is diabetic, its condition must be managed and treated to avoid further complications. Treatment for atherosclerosis is highly individualistic and varies considerably in different patients.
"
"Atherosclerosis is uncommon in dogs but when it does occur it poses a great threat to the health of your pet. A high level of commitment will be required from you in the long-term treatment of your dog. Exercising your dog regularly, managing its diet and special meal preparations, following a weight loss program if your dog is overweight, dispensing medication at the prescribed times, and visits to your veterinarian for follow-ups and progress checks will require time and commitment on your side.

"Alopecia, also known as hair loss, is a very common condition in dogs. Alopecia is different from shedding, which is a normal part of your dog’s hair growth cycle and depends on the dog’s breed. Alopecia refers to either thinning hair or spots of hair loss (bald spots). Where the hair loss occurs can depend on the underlying cause.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Depending on the cause of the alopecia, there may be accompanying symptoms including:
"
"Mild to severe scratching (but sometimes no scratching at all)
"
"Skin that is red, inflamed, thickened, oozing, bleeding, malodorous, or pigmented (black)
"
"Hair follicle tumors are generally benign tumors that originate in the hair follicles in the skin. There are two types of hair follicle tumors, trichoepitheliomas, which arise from cystic hair follicles (follicles that have closed over, like a sac), and pilomatricomas, which arise from the cells that produce the hair follicles.
"
"Trichoepitheliomas are small benign tumors, often found along a cat's back, shoulders, flank, tail or limbs. Pilomatricomas are rare skin tumors that develop from the hair matrix, where the cells which grow the hair follicles develop and are contained. Pilomatricomas are small and are often found on the trunk of middle-aged dogs.
"
"Hair follicle tumors should be immediately evaluated by a veterinarian. The prognosis for these hair follicle tumors is generally positive, as the majority of the tumors are found to be benign.
"
"Breeds that have been shown to be predisposed to hair follicle tumors are Golden Retrievers, Basset Hounds, German Shepherds, Cocker Spaniels, Irish Setters, English Springer Spaniels, Miniature Schnauzers and Standard Poodles. The prognosis for these hair follicle tumors is generally positive, as the majority of the tumors are found to be benign.
"
"Trichoepitheliomas
"
"Skin with papules (red spots), pustules (pimples), plaques, or hives. 
"
"If the alopecia is caused by parasites, they may or may not be visible. Fleas, ticks, and lice can be seen with the naked eye; mites and fungal elements such as ringworm cannot be seen. Often the dog will cause trauma to their skin by excessive scratching, causing open wounds. Many dogs will have other affected areas, such as ears and feet, particularly with certain allergies.
"
"There are numerous causes of alopecia in dogs. Here are some of the most common ones:
"
"Ectoparasites (fleas, lice, mosquitoes, mange mites such as Demodex or Sarcoptes)
"
"Spider bites or insect stings
"
"Skin infections (bacterial, fungal)
"
"Allergies (inhaled, contact, insect)
"
"Atopy, a genetic predisposition to develop allergic reactions or diseases
"
"Anxiety-related or underlying pain with self-trauma
"
"Autoimmune disorders
"
"Endocrine diseases (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, seasonal flank alopecia, sex hormone-responsive)
"
"Genetic causes (e.g., Alopecia X, color dilution alopecia, certain breed predispositions)
"
"Nutritional (starvation or unbalanced diet, vitamin deficiencies)
"
"Environmental (e.g., outdoor, filthy, hot, or moist conditions)
"
"Vaccine site alopecia
"
"Chemical exposure, burns
"
"Cancer
"
"Dogs that are especially prone to alopecia include:
"
"Mexican Hairless, Chinese Crested (“normal”)
"
"Genetic: Bulldogs, Dobermans, Yorkshire Terriers, Dachshunds, Greyhounds
"
"Nordic breeds: When clipped, hair may not return for Siberian Huskies, Pomeranians, and others
"
"Pilomatricomas
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and medical health history that you provide.
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical exam on your dog, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis.
"
"Samples of the tumor will need to be taken for a close examination of the structure of the tumor. Samples will be taken for histopathologic laboratory analysis, both by fine needle aspirate (fluid sample) and by tissue biopsy. Such an analysis will determine exactly which type of hair follicle tumor is present and whether it is benign or malignant. Although this type of tumor is often found to be benign, it is possible that histopathological results will show it to be a different kind of tumor, in which case the treatment may need to be more aggressive.
"
"Your veterinarian will most likely recommend excising the tumor, leaving wide surgical margins to ensure that the tumor has been removed entirely. f the histopathological results show a malignant tumor, your doctor may need to refer you to a veterinary oncologist for further treatment.
"
"It is important to monitor your dog for recurrence of the hair follicle tumors. If you notice that your dog is developing more of these tumors, contact your veterinarian. Overall, the prognosis for this medical condition is generally excellent, as the majority of tumors are found to be benign.

"
"A thorough physical exam by your veterinarian is the single most important step in diagnosing the cause or causes of alopecia. It is seldom a quick fix when it comes to skin disorders in dogs. Your vet will take multiple factors into consideration before determining what diagnostics are appropriate in your dog’s case (including age, breed, sex, health status, and prior medical history). 
"
"Unfortunately, there is no simple “recipe” to fix alopecia in dogs. Figuring out the cause is essential to choosing treatment options. Also, many (if not most) causes of alopecia are ongoing conditions that will need periodic medications or other treatments. Understanding this before you even make the vet appointment will go a long way in saving you from frustration if symptoms return in the future.
"
"When seeing your veterinarian, be prepared to answer thorough questions about your dog’s history, including:
"
"Diet
"
"Number of pets in the home
"
"Degree of pruritus (“itchiness”)
"
"Past treatments
"
"Dog’s environment (indoor/outdoor)
"
"Dog’s “job” (hunting dog vs. couch potato)
"
"Parasite medications
"
"Prior health issues or blood work abnormalities
"
"Exposures (pond water, wooded areas, wild animals, etc.) 
"
"
Once your vet has these answers, they can examine your pet and determine possible causes. Your vet will check closely for any evidence of fleas or flea “dirt” (feces), ticks, or saliva-stained areas such as the feet, tail base, and flanks. 
"
"They will also note any unusual odors. Yeasty feet smell like Fritos, and ears have unique smells depending on yeast or bacteria. Your dog’s skin may have a waxy or greasy feel, which will help decide what topical therapies to use. 
"
"Depending on the exam findings, your vet may recommend one or more of the following tests:
"
"Skin scrapes (for Demodectic or Sarcoptic mange)
"
"Cultures (for bacterial infections)
"
"Tape preps (looking for bacteria, yeast, and inflammatory cells)
"
"Black light and/or fungal cultures (for Dermatophytosis or ringworm)
"
"Ear smear to look for bacteria, yeast, cells, or mites
"
"Skin testing for allergies
"
"Possible food trials
"
"Blood tests (for organ function and endocrine diseases)
"
"Fecal exam (for parasites)
"
"Biopsy (for autoimmune diseases or cancer)
"
"Treating alopecia depends entirely on the cause. If it is merely cosmetic and one small lesion, no treatment may be needed. Depending on the cause, one or more of the following may be recommended:
"
"Food trials
"
"Medications (antibiotics, antifungals, steroids, antihistamines, anti-parasiticides, anti-inflammatory or anti-pruritic medications such as Apoquel, Atopica, or Cytopoint injections) 
"
"Topical therapy (medicated shampoos, sprays, ointments, or dips)
"
"Surgical removal
"
"Other
"
"If the underlying cause of the alopecia is identified, avoiding the cause in the future is very important. It is not always that simple, however, so controlling what you can will go a long way in managing your dog’s alopecia. That includes using effective, regular flea control; keeping your dog clean and well groomed; and avoiding known allergens. 
"
"If and when your dog starts to have alopecia in the future, it is vitally important that you see your veterinarian quickly in order to stop the progression of symptoms.

"Grass allergies, which are common in dogs, are inhalant or contact allergies that can be caused by pollen associated with grasses. Grass pollens are airborne, so your dog doesn’t have to be physically on the grass to have symptoms. Grass allergies can lead to skin allergies or upper respiratory allergies.   
"
"Grass allergies are generally worse in the spring and fall seasons, when grass pollen is more prevalent due to the variation of seasonal species. But they may be a problem for your dog all year long. In dogs, the allergens (grass pollens) are absorbed by the skin and mucus membranes. Many dogs with grass allergies may also have flea allergies and food allergies. 
"
"Grass allergies can occur at any age, but most dogs start having allergies after the age of 1 due to prior exposure to the allergens. While the symptoms may be irritating for your dog, most are not life-threatening.   
"
"A severe allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis, is rare. Anaphylaxis in dogs can occur within 5–30 minutes of contact with the allergen. Symptoms in dogs may include:
"
"Severe hives
"
"Facial swelling (especially around the eyes and muzzle)
"
"Wheezing
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"An increased respiratory rate
"
"Vomiting and diarrhea, with or without blood.  
"
"If you think your dog is experiencing anaphylaxis or see any of these symptoms, seek veterinary care immediately. 
"
"Symptoms of grass allergies include: 
"
"Redness of the skin (erythema)
"
"Itching (pruritus), often constant
"
"Scratching, especially at the face, armpits, and sides of the body
"
"Licking or chewing, especially the feet
"
"A rash may also appear; but due to the haircoat on dogs, redness and a visible rash may be difficult to see 
"
"Grass allergies are caused by common grass pollens from grasses such as Bermuda, fescue, alfalfa, or rye. They have similar symptoms to allergies caused by pollens from trees (cedar, pine, oak) and weeds (ragweed, pigweed).  
"
"Dogs that enjoy rolling in the grass can get symptoms from direct contact. Others may get symptoms from inhaling the pollen during a walk or from simply being in an area where grass pollen is present—even indoors.  
"
"Grass allergies occur frequently during the spring and fall, when grass is growing and pollen leaves a yellow trail of dust behind. If a dog walks through an area where pollen is present and the pollen comes into contact with mucous membranes (nose, eyes, mouth), skin, and feet, the dog may experience symptoms.
"
"Your veterinarian will obtain a complete history regarding the symptoms present in your dog, including symptom duration, severity, seasonality, and treatment (if any).   
"
"The next step would be a thorough examination of the haircoat and skin. The distribution of hair loss, any lesions on the skin such as pimples, rashes, dry or oily skin; scratches (excoriations) due to itching, redness, or skin irritation (to indicate inflammation) will help determine the diagnosis.  
"
"Sometimes, symptomatic treatment can be initiated based on clinical symptoms alone, without any testing needed, depending on the case. If topical or conservative treatments are not effective, further testing may be needed to rule out other causes. 
"
"Your primary veterinarian may be able to perform serum blood testing for allergies. However, the gold standard of allergy testing and the one test that provides the most accurate result is called an Intradermal Skin Test, which is performed by a veterinary dermatologist. The intradermal test is usually performed under mild sedation. One side of the dog’s abdomen is shaved, and specific allergens are injected.  
"
"The area is monitored for the presence of hives, indicating an allergic reaction to the specific allergen injected in that location. If the allergens are identified, treatment is designed specifically for the individual pet.  
"
"Another option is hyposensitization therapy, which consists of “micro-dosing” the pet with the allergen to build up resistance over time. 
"
"The goal of treatment will be to manage symptoms, as most grass allergies in dogs cannot be cured. Treatment is based on severity of symptoms. It’s always best to consult with your veterinarian on the best treatment for your dog. If symptoms are mild, the following topical therapies may be recommended:  
"
"Bathing in a hypoallergenic or mild oatmeal-based pet shampoo: Consistent bathing will help remove the allergens before they have time to be absorbed into the skin. This may help prevent or decrease the itching. There are several brands of oatmeal shampoos available without a prescription.  
"
"Trying a medicated shampoo: Medicated shampoos are not typically sufficient for treating an active infection, but they can help prevent an infection from happening by removing the allergens and reducing the amount of bacteria and yeast on the skin. Always talk to your vet about which medicated shampoo would be best for your dog.  
"
"Cleanliness after spending time outdoors: Ensuring that your dog’s feet and body are cleaned off after coming inside helps prevent licking and chewing of feet, a symptom of itching. You can use mild soap and water, aloe pet wipes, or medicated wipes that contain an antimicrobial and antifungal ingredient.   
"
"Antihistamines: Benadryl® may be effective for watery eyes, runny nose, and sneezing, but it is usually not effective for allergic skin conditions (allergic dermatitis). Be sure to discuss dosage with your vet before giving your dog any medication, even over-the-counter medications.  
"
"Fatty acids: Omega supplements and fatty acids can help decrease a pet’s skin inflammation and help with general itchiness. 
"
"For moderate to severe symptoms (including severe itching), other therapies may be recommended: 
"
"Short doses of corticosteroids: Medications such as prednisone, prednisolone, or temaril-P contain steroids which may be used in cases of severe itch.  These are by prescription only and typically should only be used short-term due to potential side effects of long-term administration. 
"
"Allergy medication: Apoquel® (a daily oral tablet), or Cytopoint® (an injectable given every four to eight weeks) may be prescribed to help alleviate itching. These are prescription medications, so your veterinarian will determine which is best for your dog.  
"
"Immunotherapy or hyposensitization therapy: These therapies can be used if the allergens have been identified by a blood or intradermal skin test. The treatment can be given in the form of weekly injections or an oral liquid medication, each of which are formulated specifically for the dog based on the results of the allergy test.  
"
"It’s important to determine, or at least narrow down, which grasses your dog is allergic to in order to prevent the symptoms. Dogs encounter all types of grasses, including those in yards, dog parks, or fields. It’s helpful to know which grasses are in your area, monitor symptom flare-ups, and avoid these areas when possible. 
"
"Allergies can be managed and symptoms controlled, but you should not expect a 100% cure. If symptoms are reduced by 80% (less itching), the treatment is considered successful. 
"
"OTC shampoos (mild oatmeal shampoos, moisturizing shampoo, or medicated shampoo) can be used, as well as medicated wipes (KetoHex wipes or Mal-A-Ket wipes). Dogs with allergies can be safely bathed twice weekly without drying the skin. The shampoo needs to contact the skin for 10 minutes, prior to rinsing. Ask your vet about the best shampoo for your dog’s specific needs. 
"
"If your dog plays outside in grass, walks outside in grass, or simply lives near a grassy area and experiences symptoms of red, itchy skin or feet, or sneezing and runny eyes or nose, a grass allergy is likely. Your veterinarian can evaluate your dog’s skin and help determine if your dog has allergies. The vet may need to do further testing to determine a treatment plan. 
"
"While Benadryl® or other anti-histamines may be recommended for grass allergies, often there are better options on the market with better efficacy for your pup.  These may include prescription allergy medications such as Apoquel (pill) or cytopoint (injection). It’s best to talk to your vet about the best choice for your pet.

"Gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a rare inherited disease in which the affected dog develops a sensitivity from eating gluten found in wheat and other grains. Only reported in the Irish setter breed in the United Kingdom, the disease causes diarrhea and weight loss.
"
"The mode in which Irish setters inherit this intestinal disease is unknown, but clinical signs are exacerbated by dietary gluten found in wheat and other grains.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel. Serum folate concentrations are often found to be abnormally low, a good indicator of chronic malabsorption of food. Your veterinarian can also confirm the diagnosis by taking a small intestinal (jejunal) biopsy via endoscopy (whereby a small instrument is guided through the mouth into the intestines) or laparotomy (abdominal surgery). 
"
"Biopsy specimens from affected dogs reared on a gluten diet will reveal an accumulation of intraepithelial lymphocytes (a sign of an immune reaction to gluten) and partial villus atrophy (abnormally shaped finger-like projections found in the intestine that are responsible for absorbing food).
"
"  
"
"
"
"Avoid feeding your dog food that may contain or have come in contact with gluten.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments in order to measure your pet’s serum folate concentration every 6 to 12 months.

"Glucosuria (or glycosuria) is the excretion of glucose into the urine. Normally, the kidneys are able to reclaim all of the filtered glucose from the urine into the bloodstream. Glucosuria therefore is nearly always due to kidney disorders, such as diabetes mellitus.
"
"Glucosuria is categorized as hyperglycemic (170–220 mg/dL) or normoglycemic, and subcategorized as transient or persistent. Symptoms will depend on the underlying disease, but some possible signs include:
"
"Hyperglycemic glucosuria
"
"Normoglycemic glucosuria
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to detect any underlying systemic diseases causing the glucosuria -- though often there is too little glucose present in the dog's urine to be detected. Hexokinase- or glucose dehydrogenase-based techniques are recommended for quantification of urinary glucose.
"
"
"
"The type of treatment will depend on the underlying cause of glucosuria. If a urinary tract infection is present, for example, antibiotics will be employed and adjusted according to the culture. Meanwhile, solutions or medications that may have caused the glucose to appear in the urine should be discontinued immediately.

"Glycogen storage disease, also known as glycogenosis, is characterized by deficient or defective activity of the enzymes responsible for metabolizing glycogen in the body. It is a rare inherited disorder with various types, all of which lead to the accumulation of glycogen, the main carbohydrate storage material in the body which aids short term energy storage in cells by converting to glucose as the body needs it for metabolic requirements. This abnormal accumulation in the tissues can result in the enlargement and dysfunction of various organs, including the liver, heart, and kidneys.
"
"There are four types of glycogenoses known to affect dogs, with certain species being more susceptible to some of these than others. Type I-a, more commonly known as von Gierke’s disease, occurs primarily in Maltese puppies; Type II, Pompe’s disease, occurs in Lapland dogs, usually beginning around six months of age; Type III, Cori’s disease, occurs in young female German Shepherds; and Type VII affects English Spring Spaniels aged two to nine.
"
"Type I-a, usually found in Maltese puppies, may result in failure to thrive, mental depression, low blood sugar (a condition known as hypoglycemia), and eventually death (or, to avoid symptoms, euthanasia) by sixty days of age.
"
"Type II, usually found in Lapland dogs, is characterized by vomiting, progressive muscle weakness, and cardiac abnormalities. Death usually occurs before two years of age.
"
" 
"
"Type III, usually found in German Shepherds, results in depression, weakness, failure to grow, and mild hypoglycemia.
"
"Type IV, found in English Spring Spaniels, results in hemolytic anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed, and hemoglobinuria, a condition in which the protein hemoglobin (which helps transport oxygen throughout the body) is abnormally highly concentrated in the patient’s urine.
"
"The various forms of glycogenoses all result from some sort of deficiency in glucose-metabolizing enzymes in the body. The types are distinguished by the specific enzyme deficiency. In dogs, Type I-a results from deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase, Type II from a deficiency of acid glucosidase, Type III from a deficiency of amylo-1 and 6-glucosidase, and Type VII from a deficiency of phosphofructokinase. Type IV, found in cats, results from a deficiency of the glycogen branching enzyme.
"
"Diagnostic procedures will vary depending on the symptoms and suspected type of glycogen storage disease at hand. A tissue enzyme analysis and determination of glycogen levels can serve as a definitive diagnosis. Other tests may include urine analysis, genetic testing, and electrocardiography (ECG) to check the electrical output from the heart for changes.
"
"
"
"Care will vary depending on the type of glycogen storage disease diagnosed and the severity of the symptoms. Types I-a and III in dogs may require the administration of intravenous (IV) dextrose in order to manage an immediate crisis of dangerously low blood sugar. Unfortunately, long-term management of this condition is futile. Related hypoglycemia may also be regulated with diet, by feeding frequent portions of a high-carbohydrate diet.
"
"Upon diagnosis, your dog will need to be continuously monitored and treated for hypoglycemia. However, there is not much that can be done to reverse this condition. Most animals suffering from glycogenosis are euthanized due to the progressive deterioration of their physical health.
"
"Because this is an inherited disease, animals that develop glycogen storage disease should not be bred, nor should the parents of such animals be bred out again, in order to avoid the possibility of future cases.

"If your dog is experiencing a progressive disease affecting their brain, your veterinarian may mention an uncommon condition called granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME). This condition affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system or CNS) in dogs.
"
"The term meningoencephalitis refers to inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, and the membranes around the brain and spinal cord (meninges). GME refers to granulomatous inflammation, which describes the specific types of white blood cells involved (macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells).
"
"When a dog has GME, these white blood cells form cuffs around the brain’s blood vessels and the spinal cord, which form nodules when joined.
"
"The three main types of GME include focal, disseminated or multifocal, and ocular.
"
"Focal GME is limited to one area within the central nervous system and has a slower progression of three to six months. The disseminated form, which is the most common form, affects multiple areas of the CNS and has a rapid progression over two to six weeks. The ocular form only affects the eyes. A dog can have more than one type of GME.
"
"Although dogs of any age or breed can develop GME, the disease is most common in middle-aged toy and terrier breeds. Dogs normally develop GME from age 4 to 8.
"
"Clinical signs depend on which part of the central nervous system is impacted. Common symptoms with the focal and disseminated forms include:
"
"Seizures
"
"Neck pain
"
"Wobbly gait
"
"Knuckling or dragging feet when walking
"
"Walking in circles
"
"Blindness
"
"Lack of engagement in surroundings
"
"Tilted head
"
"Facial abnormalities (such as paralysis in part of the face)
"
"Weakness
"
"The ocular form typically presents with sudden blindness in one or both eyes without other neurologic signs.
"
"There is no known specific cause of granulomatous meningoencephalitis. However, the condition is most common in middle-aged, small-breed dogs. Predisposed breeds include:
"
"Chihuahuas
"
"Dachshunds
"
"Maltese
"
"Miniature Poodles
"
"Rat Terriers
"
"Toy Poodles
"
"West Highland White Terriers
"
"Yorkshire Terriers
"
"While genetic predisposition likely plays a role in the development of GME, an excessive immune response (autoimmune condition) may be a contributing factor.
"
"Since many inflammatory conditions of the central nervous system are difficult to definitively diagnose, veterinarians often diagnose GME and other similar conditions as meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin (MUO).
"
"The veterinarian will perform a neurological exam, which includes testing reflexes and watching your dog walk. This exam helps the veterinarian determine which part of the central nerve system may be affected.
"
"A dog with neurologic signs will most likely have their blood drawn and a urinalysis to check overall body function and look for signs of infection, such as a high white blood cell count.
"
"Additional testing can include:
"
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which allows the veterinarian to examine cross-sectional images of the brain and spinal cord.
"
"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which involves collecting a sample of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This procedure requires anesthesia to keep the dog from moving or feeling pain.
"
"Infectious disease testing to rule out causes like distemper virus, fungal infections, or tick-borne infections that cause neurological signs.
"
"GME can only be definitively diagnosed by examining brain tissue under a microscope, which is normally done as part of a necropsy.
"
"GME is believed to have an autoimmune component, so suppressing the immune system is the primary goal of treatment. GME cannot be cured, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and preserve quality of life.
"
"Most dogs start on steroids, often prednisolone, to reduce inflammation and suppress their immune system. In the long term, other immunosuppressive drugs like cytosine arabinoside (a chemotherapy agent) or cyclosporine (an immunomodulator) may be added to the treatment protocol.
"
"Dogs with ocular GME will usually also be given oral steroids, but some veterinarians may recommend steroids applied directly in the eye. If the dog develops glaucoma (high pressure within their eye), this condition also need to be managed. Medications for glaucoma, such as dorzolamide and timolol, are aimed at decreasing fluid production and promoting fluid drainage from the eye.
"
"Radiation therapy may be an option for focal lesions. Dogs undergoing radiation must be anesthetized. Importantly, radiation to the head can result in other issues, such as seizures or cataracts. Options for controlling seizures due to GME include standard seizure medications.
"
"Treatment cannot be stopped, or signs will recur. The goal of treatment is to find the lowest dose required to control disease. Despite this, relapses are common.
"
"Granulomatous meningoencephalitis is not curable and lifelong management is required. While it’s possible to keep your dog comfortable for some time and improve quality of life, most dogs with focal or disseminated GME who show worsening clinical signs will eventually be euthanized.
"
"Younger dogs may have increased survival times, but dogs that have seizures or mental activity changes typically have shorter ones. Early diagnosis and treatment within the first seven days of clinical signs may also improve survival time. While around 15% to 25% of dogs with GME die of the disease or are euthanized within the first week of diagnosis, dogs that survive the first month have a decent chance of living for months, possibly more than a year.
"
"While ocular GME typically causes sudden, permanent blindness, it’s not life-threatening unless other forms of GME exist concurrently.
"
"Your dog’s coordination is likely to be affected, so placing nonslip mats on hard floors can help your dog get around. Consider using ramps or small steps onto furniture so your dog doesn’t have to jump. Keep food and water bowls easily accessible. If your dog is having seizures, consider placing a bell on their collar, which may alert you if he is having a seizure in another room.
"
"Although it’s common for dogs with GME to die of the disease or be humanely euthanized within a week of diagnosis, some dogs with GME live over a year.
"
"The cause of granulomatous meningoencephalitis is not currently known, but it’s believed to be a combination of genetic predisposition and overstimulation of the immune system.
"
"The most common signs include changes to how the dog walks, seizures, altered mentation, loss of coordination and balance, neck pain, weakness, and blindness.

"The glomeruli is a network of tiny vessels that filters waste products as it passes through the kidneys during urine formation. When the vessels become inflamed and subsequent impairment is referred to as glomerulonephritis. The most common cause of glomerulonephritis is the deposition and  entrapment of antigen-antibody complexes (such as a toxin or enzyme)  within the glomeruli. Moreoever, familial glomerulonephritis has been described in Bernese mountain dogs, bull terriers, Dalmatians, Samoyeds, Doberman pinschers, cocker spaniels, Newfoundlands, greyhounds, rottweilers, and soft-coated wheaten terriers.
"
"  
"
"Symptoms may vary depending on the underlying cause, like inflammation, infection, or neoplasia. In some dogs, the only presenting symptom may be weight loss and weakness. In fact, many times, the condition is discovered incidental to a routine annual health screening, when increased concentrations of proteins are found in the urine. If the protein loss into the urine is severe, the dog may develop an abnormal collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites).
"
"In dogs suffering from advanced disease with kidney failure, there may be symptoms of increased thirst and frequency of urination, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Those with a severe deficiency of the blood protein albumin  (hypoalbuminemia), may suffer from a blockage of the lung's blood  vessels, which causes respiratory difficulties or severe panting. High  blood pressure, meanwhile, may cause sudden blindness.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The results of the complete blood count test are usually not significant. In severe cases, the biochemistry profile may reveal abnormally low levels of blood protein albumin (hypoalbuminemia) and high levels of cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia). The presence of blood protein albumin and other proteins in the blood may help your veterinarian in making the initial diagnosis. In dogs with kidney failure, the urinalysis will reveal corresponding changes in urine.
"
"Creatinine is a waste product normally excreted by the kidneys, and its presence in the urine is measured as a diagnostic indicator of kidney function. Urine protein testing is also performed, as the amount of protein found in the urine can also be used to evaluate and monitor kidney function.
"
"A more specific test calculates the urine protein and creatinine ratio in order to give your veterinarian an idea of the degree of kidney damage. The extent of protein loss in the urine roughly correlates with the severity of the kidney disease. Therefore, measuring protein and creatinine ratio also helps in assessing treatment response and progression or regression of disease.
"
"Diagnostic imaging can also be used for determining how diseased your dog's condition is, and what treatment needs to be applied. These procedures are helpful in the diagnosis of concurrent diseases and in evaluating the kidney size. Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound can be used to evaluate the kidneys and other abdominal organs, and can be helpful in performing a less invasive type of tissue collection for biopsy purposes. Your veterinarian may take a kidney tissue sample (kidney biopsy) to rule other causes of kidney failure, such as neoplasia or cancer.
"
"
"
"As most cases of glomerulonephritis involve an immune reaction (interaction of antigen and antibodies), the most specific and effective therapy is the control and elimination of such an immune reaction. However, finding and treating the exact disease process or antigen that is causing such an immune reactions is not always possible. Moreover, once renal failure has developed, the prognosis is often poor. The overall treatment of this disease depends on the cause and severity of the disease at the time of diagnosis.
"
"Your veterinarian will recommend an individualized diet plan for your dog that is tailored toward kidney health. These patients often require low sodium and high quality, low quantity, protein diets. Because most drugs are eliminated through the kidneys, do not give your dog any types of drugs, or change the dosage of any prescribed drugs without consulting your veterinarian beforehand. In follow-up visits, your veterinarian will need to conduct regular laboratory testing in order to monitor the therapy response and progression of the disease, adjusting medications and therapies as necessary.

"Giardia is a genus of microscopic single-celled protozoal parasites that cause an intestinal infection in dogs, known as giardiasis.
"
"Certain strains can also affect humans, and infected dogs who are shedding parasites (excreting them in their feces) don’t always show signs. That means your dog could unknowingly transmit this infectious disease to you and your family.
"
"Giardia protozoa are found worldwide, and giardiasis is the most common intestinal parasitic disease in the United States, affecting more than 1 million people per year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infection is also common in dogs, affecting up to 45% in some populations, such as those in kennels.
"
"Puppies younger than a year of age are most likely to have giardia infection symptoms, and immunocompromised dogs are also at an increased risk.
"
"Developing giardia protozoa live in the small intestine and multiply. Infection can cause diarrhea, but veterinarians don’t completely understand why. Giardiasis is characterized by a foul-smelling, soft to watery diarrhea that is often tinged green and may contain blood. Some dogs also experience abdominal discomfort.
"
"The survival rate for dogs infected with giardia is typically good, but puppies, senior dogs, and those with a weakened immune system have an increased risk for complications, including death.
"
"In most cases, giardia in dogs is not considered a veterinary emergency, but puppies and dogs with severe diarrhea should receive emergency veterinary care immediately to prevent dehydration.
"
"When symptoms of giardia in dogs are present, they may include:
"
"Sudden foul-smelling, green-tinged diarrhea
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Abdominal discomfort
"
"Weight loss
"
"Giardia in dogs has two stages in its life cycle. The developing stage is the trophozoite, which changes into the cyst stage. Cysts are passed through an infected dog’s feces into the environment.
"
"Infection occurs by ingesting cysts from contaminated ground, an infected dog’s hind end, or contaminated water. After ingestion, cysts are passed in a dog’s feces in five to 12 days, and they can survive for several months in soil and water.
"
"Giardia duodenalis is the species that causes infection in dogs, and the parasite has different subtypes called assemblages.
"
"The assemblages are typically host-specific, but some can infect both humans and animals. While dogs can transmit giardia to their pet parents, most people are infected by ingesting contaminated water or food.
"
"To diagnose giardia in dogs, veterinarians will take a pup’s complete history and perform a thorough physical exam.
"
"Provide information about any exposure your dog has had to potential toxins or parasites. Other diagnostic tests your vet may perform include:
"
"Fecal testing—Fecal tests that are commonly performed to check for intestinal parasites—such as roundworms and hookworms—often can’t detect giardia, but more advanced tests are available to help diagnose the parasite. In some cases, repeated testing over several days may be necessary.
"
"Parvovirus testing—If you have a puppy or an unvaccinated dog, your vet may recommend a test to rule out parvovirus.
"
"Blood work—Your veterinarian may recommend a complete blood count (CBC) and biochemistry profile to assess your dog’s:
"
"White blood cells
"
"Red blood cells
"
"Platelets
"
"Electrolytes
"
"Organ function
"
"Hydration status
"
"The goal of treatment of giardia in dogs is to resolve an affected dog’s diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Treatment strategies often include:
"
"Fluid therapy—If your dog is dehydrated, intravenous (IV) fluid therapy may be necessary to rehydrate them and correct electrolyte imbalances.
"
"Medications—Your veterinarian may recommend an antibiotic, an anti-parasitic, or both to treat your dog’s giardia.
"
"Bathing—Since cysts that your dog has shed can cause reinfection, you must bathe your pup periodically during treatment to prevent recurrence.
"
"Cleaning—You should also wash your dog’s bedding, disinfect areas where they rest, and dispose of fecal matter as soon as possible.
"
"Most dogs with giardia recover completely in five to eight days, and they should be retested 24 to 48 hours after treatment is completed to ensure cyst shedding is resolved. During giardia treatment, some dogs benefit from probiotics or fiber added to their food.
"
"Since your dog can transmit the giardia infection to you and your family, it’s important to take precautions. Wash your hands frequently, especially after you handle your dog and their fecal matter.
"
"Remove your dog’s fecal matter from the environment as soon as possible. In addition, don’t let children or immunocompromised people clean up after your dog, as these individuals are at a greater risk for infection.
"
"Tips to help prevent giardia in dogs include:
"
"Monitor your dog—When at dog parks and other public areas, monitor your dog closely and don’t let them into contact with fecal matter.
"
"Schedule wellness exams—Schedule regular wellness exams so your veterinarian can detect issues, such as intestinal parasites, before they cause health problems for your pup.
"
"Provide year-round parasite prevention—Parasite prevention, such as Heartgard® and Simparica TRIO™, don’t protect against giardia, but they do prevent other parasites that can impact your dog’s immune system and make them more susceptible to infection in general.
"
"Vaccinate your dog—A giardia vaccine is available to help prevent infection. Ask your veterinarian if your dog would benefit from the giardia vaccine.
"
"Giardia in dogs typically takes five to eight days to clear when treated appropriately, but some cases are resistant and require longer treatment.
"
"Most giardia types can only infect one host, and disease transmission from dogs to humans is not common. However, always take precautions if your dog is sick to help ensure you or your family members aren’t infected.
"
"Wash your hands often, remove fecal matter promptly, and don’t let children or immunocompromised people clean up after your dog.

"Hepatoportal microvascular dysplasia (MVD) is a blood vessel abnormality inside the liver that causes shunting (bypass) between the portal vein (the blood vessel that connects the gastrointestinal tract with the liver) and circulation into the system. It may be caused by microscopic lesions on the liver, abnormal development, abnormal positioning, or throttling due to a prominent smooth muscle that prevents blood flow. The lobes of the liver are involved, some severely, others very little. This is suspected when the bile is not doing its work. In short, because of malformations in the blood vessels, the blood is not flowing to the liver as it should.
"
"This is a rare disease of genetic origin in certain small-breed dogs. There is compelling evidence of inheritance in Yorkshire terriers, Maltese dogs, Cairn terriers, Tibetan spaniels, shih-tzus, Havanese, and others. It is rarely without symptoms (asymptomatic). The symptoms are usually vague gastrointestinal signs: vomiting, diarrhea, and lack of appetite.
"
"Inheritance is not gender or regionally linked; it is found worldwide. It may be a dominant gene that does not affect all members, since unaffected parents may produce affected offspring, or it may be caused by more than one gene. A total serum bile acids (TSBA) test is used as the marker for this condition. Prevalence in certain small-breed dogs ranges from 30 to 70 percent. It is rare to non-existent in large-breed dogs. It is usually detected in asymptomatic juveniles by four to six months of age, or as early as six weeks.
"
"While two groups have been described (asymptomatic and symptomatic), it is most likely that dogs with the anomaly will be symptomatic. Symptoms are indicative of gastrointestinal complications: vomiting, lack of appetite (anorexia), diarrhea, and lethargy.
"
"Asymptomatic dogs are typically diagnosed in the course of routine screening or diagnostic evaluations for unrelated health problems, or on routine testing in kindreds with a known prevalence of the disorder. Congenital inherited disorder is diagnosed by total serum bile action (TSBA) before clinical signs are attributed to a microvascular tumor (MVD); concurrent illnesses may complicate the interpretation. Dogs with a microvascular tumor rarely, if ever, develop an accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Asymptomatic dogs usually have an unremarkable history; occasionally, they will display a delayed recovery after anesthesia or sedation, or show drug intolerance.
"
"Congenital inherited disorder
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, if any, and any information you might have regarding familial lines.
"
"This condition is attributed in any asymptomatic young dog with increased total serum bile action values, or in any young dog with hepatic encephalopathy (brain and nervous system damage that occurs as a complication of liver disorders). Symptomatic dogs over two years of age typically acquire a shunt owing to acute or chronic inflammatory, tumor, or toxic liver ailments.
"
"Microscopic features of many disorders causing a lack of fluid in the hepatic portal are similar to hepatoportal microvascular dysplasia. Your veterinarian will perform a liver biopsy for microscopic examination of liver tissue, aspiration needle biopsies for examination of fluid, and wedge or laparoscopically retrieved samples from the liver.
"
"
"
"No specific medical care recommended for asymptomatic dogs. You will need to watch for adverse reactions to drugs. Selected drugs or dietary protein restriction is inappropriate to prescribe. You should not treat the symptoms without first consulting your veterinarian.
"
"Brain and nervous system damage that occurs as a complication of liver disorders and protracted vomiting or diarrhea will need to be treated in hospital for supportive care and diagnostic evaluations; these dogs will most likely have other disorders, or complicated MVD. Mild brain and nervous system damage that occurs as a complication of liver disorders will be controlled with a veterinarian approved protein-restricted diet and appropriate medical treatment,
"
"Recommendations to eliminate MVD from a particular genetic line or breed are not possible at present. Based on information derived from large pedigrees of Yorkshire terriers, Cairn terriers, Tibetan spaniels, Maltese, shih-tzu, and Havanese dogs, breeding unaffected parents does not eliminate MVD from a kindred. The genetic defect involves vascular malformations commonly involving the liver, but may not be limited to this organ. In high incidence kindreds, you will need to remain vigilant for vaguely ill dogs that may have a portosystemic vascular anomaly; surgical exploration can miss this, as can some of the other standard tests.

"Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV) is a life-threatening emergency for dogs. In this condition, the stomach swells, usually with food and gas (dilatation), and twists on its axis (volvulus) in a way that the stomach contents cannot be passed into the intestines or vomited.
"
"This swelling and twisting endanger the stomach and can also affect other nearby body systems, including the spleen and the major blood vessels of the abdomen. This can lead to severe stress on the heart, shock, and if not treated quickly, death.
"
"GDV differs a bit from bloat in dogs. In both bloat and GDV the stomach becomes distended, but in GDV the stomach also twists on itself.  The word volvulus is derived from the Latin word volvere, which means “to twist.” It is possible to have bloat (of air or food) and not have a GDV. Often, bloat can be treated medically, whereas the treatment for GDV is almost always surgical.
"
"GDV is a medical emergency. If you suspect your dog may be experiencing GDV, take them to the nearest veterinary hospital immediately.

"Gastroenteritis in dogs is defined as an inflammation of a dog’s stomach (gastro-) and small intestine (-enteritis). In simple terms, gastroenteritis is an upset stomach. Pet parents might use the term “dog stomach bug” to describe this kind of illness, but the possible causes go beyond a viral infection.
"
"If your dog has bloody diarrhea or vomit, go to the emergency vet immediately, as these are signs of acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS).
"
"Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome, also known as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE), is a specific and critical form of enteritis. It is a medical emergency and one of the most serious causes of diarrhea in dogs.
"
"AHDS can be fatal—your dog can become septic (caused by a dangerous infection in the bloodstream), lose too much protein, or experience complications.
"
"Dogs affected with this disease have been shown to have inflammation of only the intestines, not the stomach. If you suspect your dog has AHDS, take them to the vet immediately.

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Take your dog to the emergency vet if you see the signs of AHDS:
"
"Sudden onset of bloody diarrhea with no known cause, such as a change in diet
"
"Vomiting, with or without blood
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"GDV may start with mild symptoms of abdominal pain. These include inability to settle, reluctance to engage in normal activity, decreased appetite, and drooling. A balloon-like, bloated abdomen is a common finding, but it may not be easily visible. Volvulus can occur without bloat and still be severe.
"
"An enlarged abdomen with or without frequent, non-productive retching and gagging warrants an emergency visit to the veterinarian. If symptoms are noted, especially in an at-risk breed, every minute counts. This is an emergency condition and must be treated immediately.
"
"Though a specific cause of GDV has not been found, there are a few risk factors that have been confirmed. Any breed can be affected, but it is most common in the German Shepherd, Great Dane, Saint Bernard, Weimaraner, Standard Poodle, Irish Setter, Gordon Setter, and Basset Hound.
"
"Mixed breeds with deep chests or a family history of GDV are just as likely to develop the condition. Risk increases with age, though it can also occur in young dogs.
"
"Most vets will have a strong suspicion for GDV based on history and physical exam, but confirmation requires X-rays. A twisted stomach has a specific shape on X-ray that is easy to differentiate from simple bloat.
"
"Bloodwork, blood pressure, and an EKG can help your veterinarian determine how severe the disease is and if there are other factors complicating treatment.
"
"Treatment for GDV is almost always surgical. The veterinarian’s first goal is to relieve stress on the heart with immediate, aggressive use of IV fluids, along with relief of the bloat. This often requires sedation and passing a tube down the esophagus to allow built-up gas to escape.
"
"After initial stabilization, your dog will be put under anesthesia, and surgery will be performed to relieve remaining gas, untwist the stomach, and evaluate the abdomen for signs of permanent damage.
"
"Severe cases may require resection (removal) of badly affected stomach wall, intestine, and spleen. The stomach is then tacked surgically to the wall of the abdomen in an effort to prevent GDV from happening again. This is known as a gastropexy, and it has been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of recurrence.
"
"After surgery, most dogs require hospitalization for pain medications, anti-nausea medications, and hydration. The hospital staff will also monitor your dog for complications that can occur in severely stressed body systems after surgery, such as arrhythmias (changes in heart rhythm) and blood clots.
"
"Once sent home, dogs will rest for a few weeks as their organs heal. It is important to feed your dog frequent small meals to avoid any recurrence.
"
"GDV is an emergency, but there are measures you can take to help prevent it. Dogs should be fed multiple small meals in a day rather than one large meal. Also, consider using a puzzle feeder or mat to slow your dog down at mealtimes. Though once commonly recommended, elevated feeding bowls may actually increase the risk of GDV and should be avoided. Avoid athletic activities immediately after eating, particularly in at-risk breeds.
"
"Gastropexy is an essential part of preventing the recurrence of GDV, but it can also be performed at the time of neuter or spay surgery to reduce the potential for GDV to occur in the first place. Many surgical facilities offer minimally invasive laparoscopic procedures. It is highly recommended that you consult with your veterinarian about whether this procedure is advised for your dog.
"
"It has been reported that 25–30% of dogs diagnosed with GDV will die. Dogs who arrive at a veterinary clinic more than six hours after clinical signs have started have a much worse prognosis. This disease requires quick treatment.

"Lethargy  (moving slowly, sluggish)
"
"Call your vet if your dog is showing any signs of gastroenteritis:
"
"Sudden vomiting
"
"Sudden diarrhea
"
"Lethargy
"
"Dogs suffering from gastroenteritis exhibit a sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhea and may lose a large volume of body fluids and electrolytes. This can cause dehydration. Monitor your dog’s hydration and activity level.
"
"If your dog is dehydrated and/or lethargic, go to the emergency vet. This indicates a more serious situation that needs immediate treatment.
"
"You can check for dehydration by gently lifting the skin on the back of your dog’s neck. If it stays raised and doesn’t go back to place quickly, your dog is probably dehydrated.

Another tip to test your dog for dehydration: press on your dog’s gums, which should turn from white back to pink within 2 seconds. If the pink takes any longer to come back, your dog is probably dehydrated.
"
"Other signs of dehydration include:
"
"Panting
"
"Dry nose and eyes
"
"Dry, pasty gums and thick saliva
"
"Loss of appetite
"
"Loss of skin elasticity (when you pull your dog’s skin and it is slow to snap back)
"
"Gastroenteritis in dogs can be caused by many underlying issues. Your vet can run diagnostic tests to help you figure out why your dog is sick. Some possible causes include:
"
"Dietary indiscretion (meaning your dog ate something they shouldn’t, such as fatty food, food that’s gone bad, or inedible objects)
"
"Gastric ulcers
"
"Toxins
"
"Cancer
"
"Kidney failure
"
"Liver failure
"
"Bacterial infection, such as clostridium, campylobacter, salmonella, or E. coli
"
"Viral infection, such as parvovirus, coronavirus, or distemper
"
"Parasites
"
"Food allergies
"
"The exact cause of AHDS remains unknown. Some vets theorize that the condition begins with a bacterial infection in the intestine caused by Clostridium perfringens type A.
"
"This infection creates dangerous toxins that erode the protective lining of the intestine, allowing fluids and blood to leak out.
"
"This diagnosis is made when a dog has a sudden case of vomiting or diarrhea, has been sluggish and lethargic, and hasn’t had an appetite. Describing your dog’s symptoms can help your veterinarian make the diagnosis. Your vet will also check your dog for dehydration and signs of abdominal pain.
"
"To rule out other possible causes of vomiting and diarrhea, such as parvovirus, parasites, a gastrointestinal obstruction, cancer, kidney disease, and other more serious conditions, your veterinarian may need a fecal analysis, bloodwork, X-ray, or ultrasound.
"
"Your vet will also consider AHDS as a possible cause if your dog has bloody, watery diarrhea; dehydration; and an elevated packed cell volume (the number of red blood cells currently circulating).
"
"There is no specific test to diagnose AHDS in dogs. If no other cause is found for your dog’s symptoms, a diagnosis of AHDS may be made as a ""diagnosis of exclusion.”
"
"An Addisonian crisis, which is when a dog with Addison’s disease has acute gastrointestinal symptoms that are often bloody, can look exactly like AHDS. This is fatal if untreated.
"
"Since an Addisonian crisis and AHDS are both so serious, it is critical to take your dog to the vet immediately if they are dehydrated or have bloody diarrhea.
"
"The goal of treatment is to stop the vomiting/diarrhea and maintain hydration.
"
"Depending on your dog’s condition and the underlying cause, your veterinarian may administer anti-vomiting medication, antibiotics, and antacid medications specifically formulated for dogs.
"
"If your dog is vomiting, the medications will be administered through injection. Your dog may also require hospitalization for IV (intravenous) fluids and electrolytes.
"
"AHDS is very serious and cannot be treated at home. If your dog has bloody diarrhea or vomit, go to the emergency vet immediately.
"
"Dogs with AHDS are losing a life-threatening amount of fluid, protein, and electrolytes, and they must be hospitalized for aggressive IV therapy, electrolyte supplementation, and medication.
"
"With AHDS, the survival rate is 90–95% if appropriate, aggressive therapy is started quickly. Most dogs recover in two or three days.
"
"After your dog comes home from the vet, you can continue care. If the vet finds that your dog’s gastroenteritis is caused by something that’s contagious, isolate your dog from your other pets. Do not allow your dog to eat or drink until there has been no vomiting for six to eight hours.
"
"Then you may give your dog small amounts of clear liquids (water, Gatorade, Pedialyte, or other electrolyte solution) every two hours.
"
"If your dog does not vomit the fluid after 12 hours, give frequent, small meals of boiled hamburger and rice or boiled chicken and rice, about ¼ cup or less per feeding. Your vet might also send you home with samples of a low-fat, easily digestible prescription diet such as these
"
"Part of your dog’s recovery plan from AHDS should be a bland diet that’s high in carbohydrates and low in protein and fat. Your vet may offer you special canned food, or you can cook for your dog.
"
"Cooked rice or pasta; potatoes with some cottage cheese; lean, boiled ground beef; or skinless chicken are good choices for a couple of weeks as your dog's gut heals and their appetite returns. Ask your veterinarian about options for cooking for your dog to ensure that you provide the right nutrients in the right amounts.
"
"If your dog is vomiting or has diarrhea, you should always call your veterinarian. They can ask you specific questions to help assess how serious the situation is.
"
"If your dog is lethargic or showing blood in their vomit or diarrhea, take them to the vet immediately. Dogs with AHDS need to be hospitalized for care and cannot be managed safely at home.
"
"After a vet evaluates your dog’s symptoms, they might determine that your dog can be safely managed at home, and they will give you a treatment plan for home care. This may include giving your dog small amounts of clear liquids (water, Gatorade, Pedialyte, or other electrolyte solution) every 2 hours, but only after vomiting has stopped for 6 to 8 hours.
"
"If your dog does not vomit the fluid after 12 hours, give frequent, small meals of boiled hamburger and rice or boiled chicken and rice, about ¼ cup or less per feeding. Do not give your dog over-the-counter or prescription medication unless you speak to your veterinarian.
"
"Cholelithiasis is a medical condition resulting from the formation of stones in the gallbladder. Gallstones are typically made up of calcium or other secreted substances. Gallstones occur in dogs, but, the bile in dogs is different from that in humans in that it has low cholesterol saturation. In fact, in dogs there is usually lower cholesterol and calcium stone composition than in humans. Miniature Schnauzers, Poodles, and Shetland Sheepdogs may be predisposed to gallstones. Stones in the bile ducts or the gallbladder may be visible on an X-ray, or they may not. Unless there are serious symptoms, surgery is not recommended for gallstones.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"There are cases where there are no apparent symptoms. However, if there is an infection in addition to the gallstones, the dog may display vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice.
"
"There are several causes for gallstones that will be considered. A failure of the gall bladder to function can interrupt the bile flow, or the bile may be sludging; the bile may be supersaturated with pigment, calcium, or cholesterol; stone formation may be caused by inflammation, an infection, a tumor, or the shedding of cells; or, the stones may bring on inflammation and allow the invasion of bacteria.
"
"Low protein can lead to the formation of stones in the gallbladder.
"
"In working toward a conclusion for the cause of cholelithiasis, your veterinarian will need to confirm or rule out diseases of the liver, pancreatitis, inflammation of the bile duct or gallbladder, and a gallbladder distended by an inappropriate accumulation of mucus.
"
"A complete blood count will be ordered to look for bacterial infection, obstruction in the bile duct, or other underlying factors that could be causing the symptoms. X-rays are not usually very effective in looking at the gallbladder, but your veterinarian will probably want to use ultrasound to make an internal visual examination. Ultrasound imaging can detect stones, a thickened gallbladder wall, or an over sized bile tract. This can also be used as a guide for the collection of specimens for culture. Should surgery be recommended, a thorough examination of the liver before surgery will be necessary.
"
"
"
"There is disagreement over whether an attempt to medically dissolve the stones is appropriate if the dog does not seem to be in danger. If intravenous (IV) treatment is indicated, your dog will need to be hospitalized until it is stable. In some cases, exploratory surgery will be the treatment route chosen. If this is a chronic problem for your dog, new stones may form even if there is surgery to remove the existing ones.
"
"Medications that can be used to treat the stones, and any related complications, will be pills to help dissolve the stones; vitamin K1 will be given intravenously if the patient is jaundiced; vitamin E will be prescribed if high liver enzymes or inflammation in the liver and bile duct are diagnosed; S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) may be prescribed to improve liver function and bile production; Antibiotics may also be warranted to treat associated infections, bacterial complications, or to prevent infection when outside intervention needs to be used (e.g., IV, surgery, or any treatment that necessitates going into the body).
"
"A fat-restricted, high protein diet is most likely to be prescribed for the long term.
"
"Yes. Gastroenteritis can often become acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) when left untreated. This is the most acute form of gastroenteritis in dogs and can lead to life-threatening dehydration if not treated quickly.
"
"Some of the causes of gastroenteritis are zoonotic, meaning they are contagious from dogs to humans. Bacterial infections like E. coli, salmonella, and listeria would fall into this category.
"
"Some of the causes are specific to dogs and harmless to humans, such as canine parvovirus and distemper.

"If your dog had surgery, a physical examination and testing will be needed every two to four weeks for as long as your veterinarian recommends it. Periodic ultrasound exams to evaluate the ongoing functioning of the liver and bile system will be called for. You will need to watch for any sudden onset of fever, abdominal pain, or weakness, since it may indicate infection from a breakdown in the bile functioning process.

"Gallbladder mucocele causes obstruction of the gallbladder's storage capacity due to the formation of a thick, mucoid bile mass inside the gallbladder, impairing its ability to function. The accumulated bile may extend the gallbladder, resulting in necrotizing cholecystitis – tissue death due to inflammation of the gallbladder. 
"
"Gallbladder mucocele is common among middle-aged to older dogs, particularly Shetland sheepdogs, cocker spaniels and miniature schnauzers, and is not gender-specific. 
"
"Gallbladder mucocele may be symptomatic or asymptomatic (without symptoms). The general symptoms are:
"
"The determining diagnosis of gallbladder mucocele will be based on the distinctive conditions that would cause abnormal functioning (dysmotility) of the gallbladder. Some of the possible factors responsible for bile blockage (stasis) are neoplasia (tumor growth), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), and choleliths (gallstones), amongst other observed causes. 
"
"Diagnosis is made through blood biochemistry, hematology, lab tests and imaging studies. The common observations are:
"
"Biochemistry
"
"Hematology/CBC
"
"Lab tests
"
"Imaging
"
"
"
"Gallbladder mucocele treatment depends on the condition of the patient. Outpatients are generally put on anti-inflammatory and liver protecting agents like ursodeoxycholic acid and S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM-e). Inpatients are treated according to imaging and ultrasound results. Patients with higher lipids are restricted from fat-rich foods. If inflammation of the abdominal lining (bile peritonitis) is confirmed, abdominal cleansing (lavage) is recommended. All patients should be put on hydration therapy to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
"
"Other than broad-spectrum antimicrobials, depending on symptoms, the patients are put on anti-emetics, antacids, gastroprotectants, Vitamin K1 and antioxidant medications. After the treatment, all gallbladder mucocele patients must be periodically monitored with biochemistry, hematology and imaging studies to exclude/include various complications like cholangitis or cholangiohepatitis, bile peritonitis and EHBDO.

"Polymositis and dermatomyositis are both generalized disorders which involve the inflammation of the dog's muscles. More specifically, polymyositis involves skeletal muscle damage due to inflammation, but with no pus formation, whereas dermatomyositis is a form of polymyositis in which characteristic skin lesions are also seen.
"
"Various breeds of dog, including Newfoundland and boxer, may be affected by polymositis, while dermatomyositis is typically reported in rough-coated collies, Shetland sheepdogs, and Australian cattle dogs.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and tests to evaluate levels of creatine kinase enzyme -- normally found in the brain, muscles, and other tissues -- to assess muscular damage.
"
"He or she will also collect a sample of the muscle to send to a veterinary pathologist for further evaluation. This is the single most important test for diagnosing polymyositis.
"
"In dogs with regurgitation, thoracic X-rays will help evaluate the esophagus for dilatation or identify tumor(s) within the esophagus. Surgery may be required if tumor(s) are found.
"
"
"
"Corticosteroids are typically used to suppress an overactive active immune system, which may be an underlying factor. In addition, antibiotics are prescribed to fight off infection. Long-term corticosteroids treatment may be required in dogs with severe immune-mediate diseases.
"
"As muscle inflammation decreases, you will need to increase your pet's activity level to improve muscle strength. Dogs with an enlarged esophagus (megaesophagus) will require special feeding techniques. You will briefed about elevating feeding and adding various foods to the dog's diet, especially foods of different consistencies. In cases of severe regurgitation, your veterinarian will place a feeding tube into the dog's stomach to ensure proper nutrition. He or she will also show you how to use the feeding tube correctly, and will assist in setting up a feeding schedule. In addition, good supportive care is required to prevent skin wounds and ulcers in non-emergency patients.
"
"Fortunately, dogs with polymositis and dermatomyositis due to immune-mediated causes have a good prognosis. If cancer is the underlying cause of the diseases, however, prognosis is poor.

"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Glaucoma is an eye disease caused by increased pressure inside the eye. Also known as intraocular pressure (IOP), this condition is a result of an imbalance in the production of fluid and drainage.
"
"The eye produces a fluid called aqueous humor from an area called the ciliary body. This fluid contains oxygen and nutrients that feed all ocular structures. Once these structures are fed, the remaining fluid is emptied via the iridocorneal angle — an area between the outer layer of the eye, the cornea and the iris, the pigmented/colored portion of the eye.
"
"IOP should remain normal and consistent if drainage and production are equal. If they’re not, there is increased pressure behind the eye and glaucoma is present. The condition is caused by decreased drainage of the aqueous humor, not overproduction.
"
"There are two types of glaucoma:
"
"Open-angle glaucoma, a slow, chronic progression of blindness.
"
"Closed-angle glaucoma, a sudden increase in IOP that leads to acute pain and blindness.
"
"Increased IOP causes damage to:
"
"The optic nerve, which carries visual messages taken in from the eye to the brain
"
"The retina, which senses light in the eyes and sends signals to the brain to create images
"
"The optic disk, where the nerve enters the eye
"
"This condition is often painful and can acutely or slowly cause blindness due to continued damage to the optic nerve. Blindness can be prevented, or at least delayed, with a prompt diagnosis.
"
"Acute glaucoma is easier for dog owners to recognize due to sudden changes to the eye and signs of pain. Gradual onset of glaucoma is often missed by pet parents, as the clinical signs can be subtle. Clinical signs noted in dogs with acute severe glaucoma include:
"
"Dilated pupils that are nonresponsive to direct light
"
"Redness in the whites of the eye
"
"Swelling and/or bulging of the eye
"
"Rubbing and/or scratching at the eye
"
"Sleeping more, or acting quieter than usual
"
"Squinting or avoiding being touched near the affected eye
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Increased watery discharge from the eye
"
"Sudden blindness — bumping into things, not wanting to move around the house as much and sudden anxiety
"
"Clinical signs associated with mild to moderate chronic glaucoma include:
"
"Cloudy or hazy blueish appearance to the outer layer of the eye
"
"Slightly dilated pupils that are slow to respond to light
"
"Plump or slightly distended eye veins in the white of the eye
"
"Slight eye enlargement
"
"Prolonged, elevated IOP causes the eyeball to look very large and even feel firm to the touch. It can cause the lens (the small, rounded structure behind the iris that acts to focus light) to be displaced from its original location. Elevated IOP can eventually lead to a rupture of the eye from the continued pressure.
"
"Primary glaucoma is caused by increased IOP in an otherwise healthy eye. It is often due to genetic, inherited abnormalities of the eye’s drainage angle.
"
"Goniodysgenesis is an inherited risk factor for closed-angle glaucoma and puts affected dogs at a higher risk of glaucoma in the future. It can be diagnosed through genetic testing, and dogs with this gene should have regular eye exams to check IOPs.
"
"Primary open-angle glaucoma causes a more gradual increase in IOP, and vision loss is very slow. Genetic testing is available for this condition.
"
"Secondary glaucoma is the most common type in dogs, and is caused by increased IOP due to injury or a medical condition of the eye.
"
"Lens luxation occurs when the lens which usually sits behind the iris, dislocates in front of the iris, and blocks the drainage angle or the pupil, thus trapping fluid behind it.
"
"Uveitis (inflammation of the interior components of the eye) causes inflammation, debris, and/or scar tissue that blocks the drainage angle, causing fluid accumulation.
"
"Cataracts affect the lens of the eye and can cause inflammation or debris that blocks the drainage angle, leading to fluid accumulation.
"
"Tumors can lead to physical obstruction and/or inflammation, causing fluid accumulation and a lack of drainage.
"
"Bleeding in or around the eye from trauma, retinal detachment, etc., can prevent fluid drainage from the iridocorneal angle.
"
"Glaucoma is considered a medical emergency, so if you note any changes in your dog’s eyes that concerns you, bring your pet to a vet as soon as possible. Physical examination, history of onset of symptoms, and any other major medical issues should be considered — especially if trauma to the eye has occurred.
"
"Intraocular pressure is measured and compared in both eyes using an instrument called a tonometer. Elevated pressures in one or both eyes confirms glaucoma. The next step may be referral to a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist who can perform a gonioscopy to evaluate the drainage angles of the eyes.
"
"Ocular ultrasound and/or electroretinography may also be considered by the specialist depending on presentation and severity of the symptoms.
"
"It is vital to decrease IOP as soon as possible to lessen the risk of blindness and damage to the optic nerve. Because of this urgency, treatment is started as soon as possible. Any underlying disease process causing glaucoma needs to be determined and treated to appropriately treat the condition.
"
"Usually, multiple ophthalmic medications are prescribed to lower the IOP to normal range as quickly as possible. These medications help drain fluid from the eye and include:
"
"Eye drops — including carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (such as Orzolamide), prostaglandins (such as Latanoprost), and beta-adrenergic blocking agents (such as Timolol) — to help drain the fluid from behind the eye to lower IOP acutely.
"
"Analgesics, or pain medications, to treat the discomfort associated with this medical condition.
"
"In severe cases where the optic nerve has minimal damage, cyclocryotherapy may be considered. This treatment uses very cold temperatures to kill the ciliary body cells that produce fluid within the eye.
"
"Another possible procedure is an injection of specialized medication into the eye itself. This, too, destroys the cells that produce fluid. With early diagnosis, these procedures can slow further progression.
"
"Often, in severe cases where the optic nerve has irreversible damage, surgical removal of the eye is performed. This eliminates the source of pain and the need for continued glaucoma therapy at home. Most dogs adjust quickly to their environment after a surgical eye removal.
"
"Most glaucoma cases require lifelong treatment. Frequent visits to the vet for IOP monitoring and medication adjustments will be necessary, especially at the start of therapy.
"
"Most pets with glaucoma are affected in both eyes. If glaucoma is found in only one eye, steps are usually taken to protect the unaffected eye. This is especially important with primary glaucoma (inherited), as more than 50 percent of dogs develop glaucoma in the unaffected eye within eight months of diagnosis in the affected eye.
"
"Yes, a dog can live with glaucoma.
"
"Severely elevated intraocular pressures — whether from acute severe glaucoma or from chronic gradual glaucoma — is often very painful.
"
"Estimates range from $1,000 to $3,000 depending on the surgery performed, the health of the retina and optic nerve and the cause of glaucoma.

"Mycotoxicosis is the medical term used to describe a diseased state that is brought on by a mycotoxin, a toxic chemical that is produced by a fungal organism, such as molds and yeasts. Deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin for its effect on the digestive system, is a mycotoxin produced by the fungus Fusarium graminearum in grains such as corn, wheat, oats, and barley. Mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol refers to the toxic reaction that results when a dog ingests pet food that was made with DON-contaminated grain.
"
"Known symptoms of mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol include a sudden refusal of food and/or vomiting after the ingestion of food contaminated by DON. The refusal of food with concurrent vomiting may also lead to subsequent weight loss. Note that if the contaminated food is removed and no longer given, these abnormal signs may resolve and no treatment will be necessary.
"
"Studies have shown that vomiting in dogs is common if DON concentration in food is greater than eight milligrams per kilogram of food.
"
"Mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol is caused by the ingestion of grains (for example, barley, wheat, corn or oats and other grains commonly used in the production of pet feeds) that are contaminated by the fungus known as Fusarium. This fungus may react in the body in a toxic manner, leading to symptoms such as vomiting, refusal of food, and weight loss.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms.  Diagnosis of mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol can be achieved by analyzing the suspected pet food for the presence of DON. Other diagnostic procedures that may rule out diseases with similar symptoms to those of mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol (namely inappetite and vomiting) include X-rays, chemical blood profile, and urine analysis.
"
"Alternate diagnoses may include an infection due to virus, bacteria, or parasite, exposure to various toxins (such as ethanol poisoning), ingestion of poisonous plants, tumors or other abnormal cell growths, or an infection of the pancreas.
"
"
"
"This condition can generally be solved simply by removing the contaminated pet food, which should result in a quick end of vomiting and a return to normal appetite and food intake. If this is done, no need for further treatment or medications should be necessary.
"
"If mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol has been diagnosed, and the problem addressed via removal of the contaminated food, it will still be important for your veterinarian to check your dog's symptoms. Severe vomiting can lead to dehydration for example, in which case body fluids will need to be replenished before any of the internal organs are damaged. If weight has been lost due to vomiting or lack of appetite, your dog's weight will need to be monitored to ensure that expected normal weight gain occurs in the recovery period.
"
"This is a preventable disease. Mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol can be avoided by feeding only high-quality dog foods that are free of DON.

"Mycotoxicosis-aflatoxin toxicity is the medical term used for a condition resulting from a fungal toxin that affects the liver of dogs. The fungi Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus, and Penicillium puberulum are the known transmitters of  aflatoxin. It is known to develop in humid climates, where grain-based foods are more likely to be exposed to moisture.  The condition may also develop if contaminated grains (such as grains that are improperly stored and thereby exposed to moisture) are used in the production of feeds. It is known that occasional outbreaks have occurred due to contaminated grains being used in the production of commercial dog foods.
"
"This condition is known only to occur in dogs – no cases have been reported in cats – and is rarely reported. It is believed that young male dogs and pregnant females may be more susceptible. Outdoor dogs are also believed to be at higher risk.
"
"The clinical symptoms of mycotoxicosis-aflatoxin are dependent on the dose and time of ingestion. Acute symptoms (those symptoms that develop suddenly) include anorexia and accompanying weight loss, hemorrhage, and ascites, a condition in which fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity in the abdomen. Acute symptoms may be so severe as to lead to sudden death.
"
"Chronic (long-term) symptoms include anorexia, weight loss, depression, liver failure, and coagulopathy, a blood-clotting disorder in which the blood fails to clot normally.
"
"Mycotoxicosis-aflatoxin is a serious condition that if left untreated can lead to persistent liver dysfunction. Even with treatment, the prognosis is poor for dogs diagnosed with this condition.
"
"The condition mycotoxicosis-aflatoxin is caused by the ingestion of grain-based foods contaminated by the fungi known as Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus, or Penicillium puberulum. When contaminated grain-based feeds are ingested, they may react with an enzyme in the liver (specifically the P450 enzyme), leading to a toxic reaction. Foods that show obvious signs of mold and spoiling are an obvious indication that your dog may have ingested a toxic fungus. Dogs that spend a lot of time outdoors are at increased risk.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your doctor will need to differentiate  mycotoxicosis-aflatoxin toxicity from other conditions that show symptoms of liver disease and  coagulopathy. To this end, a liver biopsy may help eliminate other possible diagnoses, such as liver disease, and a coagulation profile will be performed.
"
"The primary test that can be used to diagnose mycotoxicosis-aflatoxin toxicity is a urine analysis for the aflatoxin metabolite (Aflatoxin M1). An analysis of possibly contaminated food samples for aflatoxin traces may also be useful if you have samples of food that your dog has eaten recently.
"
"
"
"Treatment for mycotoxicosis-aflatoxin toxicity is aimed at reducing stress on the liver. A high-quality protein diet, including a source of dietary glucose, such as corn syrup, is recommended. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines closely regarding diet recommendations. The administration of intravenous (IV) fluids may also be necessary if your dog is suffering from anorexia and weight loss. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to treat the coagulation disorder, such as heparin, but any type of drug that needs to be metabolized by the liver will be avoided in order to prevent any further stress on the liver's ability to function.
"
"Administer any prescribed medications regularly, and stick to your veterinarian's dietary recommendations. As previously mentioned, a high-quality protein and dietary glucose supplements are both recommended.
"
"Do not feed your dog foods that are obviously moldy, as they may be contaminated with one of these toxic fungi. Store feed dishes in a clean dry area to avoid moisture from accumulating, and clean feed dispensers regularly to avoid moisture and contamination. Prevention is important, since even with treatment the prognosis is poor for dogs affected by mycotoxicosis-aflatoxin.

"Fungal infections are uncommon in dogs. In fact, because of the widespread existence of fungi in the environment, these  organisms are harmless most of the time, or the body is adept at  fighting off any ill effects brought on by the fungus. In some cases, thought not all, some types of fungus can cause symptoms of infection in the body. For example, fungi may inhabit and infect the lower urinary tract and may also appear in the urine after being released from the kidneys.
"
"Dogs of any age, breed, or gender may be affected.
"
"Even when a fungal infection has become well established in the lower urinary tract, there are many dogs that display no clinical symptoms. However, in others the following symptoms may be seen:
"
"Following are the risk factors which may predispose your dog to a lower urinary tract fungal infection:
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog’s health, including a description of the symptoms and any events that might have occurred around the time of onset, such as field outings, visits to wooded areas, lakes, etc. After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your dog. Laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of the complete blood count and biochemistry profile are often normal.  However, if a fungal infection has spread to other body organs, the abnormalities in these tests will depend on which of the organs is being affected.
"
"Urinalysis is important in the diagnosis of this disease as the fungus is often passed into the urine and the laboratory testing may confirm the presence of the fungus in urine. Your veterinarian will also recommend a urine culture test, which will allow for the growing and identification of the causative fungus. Various species of fungi can be identified on the basis of their different growth patterns and characteristics on culture. More specific tests are also available for the identification of the most common species of fungi that cause infections in animals. Your veterinarian will recommend these tests if the fungus that is involved in the infection could not be identified by the culture testing.
"
"
"
"Fungal infections are relatively uncommon in dogs, usually occurring in the presence of other certain risk factors that are known to predispose a dog to fungal infections. Identifying and correcting these risk factors is important for the overall treatment of these infections.
"
"Antifungal drugs are prescribed to eliminate the infection, with the duration of the treatment varying according to the individual animal. A urinary catheter may be used to infuse drugs directly in to the lower urinary tract. Repeat infusions may be required for complete recovery.
"
"In some dogs long-term treatment may be required for the complete resolution of clinical symptoms. During treatment, urine samples will again be collected and sent to the laboratory for culture testing. Usually two urine cultures are performed at a 10-14 day interval to see if the fungal infection has resolved or not. The fungal culture will be repeated two months after the cessation of therapy.
"
"You’ll need to take care of your dog’s diet and also adhere to your veterinarian's recommendations regarding treatment. Monitor the appearance of your dog's urine for changes in the color of the fluid, or to note if the dog is having difficulty urinating. If anything appears out of the ordinary, consult your veterinarian so that adjustments to the treatment can be made.

"Pneumocystosis is a fungal (Pneumocystis carinii) infection of the respiratory system. Commonly found in the environment, P. carinii only affects dogs (or humans) with compromised immune systems. This is because the weakened body defenses allows the organism to multiply and grow to critical levels in the lungs.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"Generally, the breathing difficulties will progressively worsen over a four-week period. Other signs associated with pneumocystosis include:
"
" 
"
" 
"
" 
"
"Pneumocystosis is caused by an overabundance of the P. carinii fungus in the respiratory system, typically found in immune-compromised dogs.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are usually non-specific and may show increased number of leukocytes or white blood cells as seen in infections, increased number of eiosinophils, and increased number of red blood cells. Blood gases testing, meanwhile, may reveal decreased partial pressure of oxygen in blood (hypoxemia), and increased pressure in blood pH. Thoracic X-rays are also conducted to see the severity and stage of the infection, as related to the lungs.
"
"For definitive diagnosis, however, your veterinarian will take a respiratory fluid sample or tissue sample to a pathologist to test for abnormal levels of P.carinii. Although it is the most reliable method for verifying pneumocystosis, lung biopsies are not without complications. Moreover, few diagnostic kits are available.
"
" 
"
" 
"
" 
"
"Hospitalization and intensive care is required in severe cases. This may include oxygen therapy to minimize respiratory discomfort and prevent further decrease in the blood's oxygen level, and antibiotics to control infection. In these cases, dogs are kept in isolation to minimize exposure to other pathogens. Physical therapy may also be used to promote the removal of secretion from the lungs, while intravenous fluids are used to correct dehydration.
"
" 
"
" 
"
"Prognosis will ultimately depend on the disease that has caused the immunodeficiency. However, it is generally promising in less severely affected patients that have undergone treatment early.
"
" 
"
"Regular monitoring of blood gases, pulse, and thoracic radiography is required to monitor the dog's response to the treatment. In addition, you should restrict the dog's activity level to a minimum and allow it to rest in a cage. If you should notice any signs of a deteriorating condition, such as coughing, respiratory discomfort, etc., call your veterinarian immediately.

"The fungus is contracted through the dog's nasal passages and then passes into the brain, eyes, lungs, and other tissues. It is usually rare in dogs.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Symptoms will vary and depend greatly on the organ systems affected by the fungus. However, animals may have a history of problems for weeks or months, be especially sluggish, and (in less than 50 percent of animals) have a mild fever. Other symptoms include:
"
"The Cryptococcus yeast is usually inhaled through the nasal passages. Occasionally, these organisms may reach the terminal airways, although it is unlikely.
"
"It can also infect the stomach and the intestines, entering through the gastrointestinal tract.
"
"Your veterinarian will be making a diagnosis based on findings from the following tests:
"
"
"
"Any nervous systems shown in your animal may require inpatient supportive care. Outpatient care is used when the dog is stable.
"
"Malassezia pachydermatis is a yeast found on the skin and ears of dogs. Though a normal inhabitant of these regions, an abnormal overgrowth of the yeast can cause dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin. The exact reasons behind this disease are not yet known, but it has been linked to allergy, seborrhea, and possibly congenital (born with) and hormonal factors.
"
"Malassezia dermatitis can affect any breed of dog, but the following breeds are predisposed to this disease: poodles, basset hounds, West Highland white terriers, cocker spaniels, and dachshunds.
"
"High humidity and temperature may increase the frequency of the cases. Other factors that may be a predisposing factor to this hypersensitivity disease include concurrent infections and food and flea allergies. Genetic factors are also suspected for young onset in predisposed dog breeds.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal unless the dog has a concurrent disease.
"
"More specific testing includes a culture of the causative organism as well as taking a small skin tissue sample for a skin cytology test. In this test your veterinarian will touch a sterilized cotton swab to the affected area and stain it with Diff-Quik stain on a glass slide. After staining, the glass slide is observed under a microscope to demonstrate the yeast in the sample. This will help him or her identify the causative organism.
"
"
"
"There are various therapeutic agents used in treating this condition, but the ultimate goal is to reduce the number of yeast and bacteria. Your veterinarian will suggest medications for application on the skin and will also recommend medicated shampoos, which should help remove scales and resolve foul odors. Concurrent bacterial infections will be treated with antibiotics and antibacterial shampoos.
"
"You will need to regularly visit your dog’s veterinarian for evaluation of disease and treatment progress. At each visit, your veterinarian will examine your dog and perform a skin cytology test to confirm that the number of causative organism is decreasing. Skin irritation and bad smell usually resolve within one week of treatment; however, recurrence of disease is common when underlying conditions are not resolved.
"
"Follow guidelines strictly and apply the topical medications as prescribed. Do not use any shampoo or medication or alter treatment on your dog without consulting your veterinarian. As recurrence is common, watch your dog for any untoward symptoms and call your veterinarian if you suspect a recurrence.

"Surgery is recommended if the dog has nodular (granulomatous) masses in its nose and throat; removal of these masses will alleviate breathing difficulties.
"
"Monitor blood work (liver enzymes) monthly in dogs receiving antifungal drugs. Improvement in clinical signs, resolution of lesions, improvement in well being, and return of appetite measure response to treatment. Conduct blood tests that detect the presence of antigens of Cryptococcus.
"
"Anticipated duration of treatment is three months to one year; patients with central nervous system disease may require lifelong maintenance treatment.
"
"Measure the presence of antigens of Cryptococcus every two months, and up until six months after completion of treatment (or until the antigen is no longer detectable). If patient maintains low titers -- the amount of medicine or antibodies found in a patient's blood – for several months after all signs of disease have resolved, continue the treatment for at least three months. If titers suddenly rise after treatment, resume the therapy.

"Rhinosporidiosis is a very rare chronic (long-term) infection that typically occurs in the mucous membranes of dogs. It most commonly occurs in the nose and nostrils, but can also take hold in the nose and eyes. Rhinosporidiosis belongs to the zoonotic class of fungal infections, meaning that it can be transmitted to humans.
"
"Signs and symptoms of rhinosporidiosis include the following: sneezing, bleeding, wheezing, or labored breathing; an infection of the nostrils with a cauliflower-like growth; a polyp or other growth located near or on the nostril - this growth may be white or yellowish in color and may appear speckled or spotted because of the fungus associated with the growth.
"
"Humans will sometimes contract a form of this infection. In instances like this, one might notice a small growth or polyp on the reproductive organs, including the penis or vagina, or a growth along the ears or near the eyes. However, this type of fungal infection is exceedingly rare in dogs, and even more so in human beings.
"
"The primary cause of rhinosporidiosis is infection with the fungus rhinosporidium seeberi. Risk factors include frequent exposure to stagnant or standing water, and living in a dry and dusty climate.
"
"The best way to diagnose an infection caused by rhinosporidium seeberi is by examining the polyp or nasal growth, or examining the abnormal cells caused by the fungus. Your veterinarian can do this by removing the polyp, or by removing part of the affected tissue for bioptic examination.
"
"Your doctor may also find it necessary to order a radiograph or x-ray of the nasal cavity; however, these typically will return as normal, as will other types of tests, including urine tests and blood tests.
"
"The fungus responsible for this rare type of infection may show up on other types of findings, including what are known as histopathologic findings. These include diagnostic tests of epithelial or skin cell analysis, and testing of organisms in the surrounding tissues. A medical professional may excise or cut away the mass, or perform a rhinotomy, which involves cutting into part of the nose to remove the infected tissue.
"
"To confirm a diagnosis, your veterinarian will usually confirm the pathologic findings, which will typically show ulcers in the skin cells, an abnormal increase in the number of cells within the tissue surrounding the nose or nostril, and fibrous tissue surrounding the nasal cells. Lab testing will show an inflammatory reaction within the skin cells if the fungal organisms are released into the surrounding skin and nasal tissue, making identification of the fungus possible.
"
"
"
"Treatment involves proper hygiene and proper attention to wound care. It is important to keep your pet confined, or within a cage, during recovery, and to keep the area clean and free of debris, to prevent the possibility of re-infection.
"
"It is important to return to your veterinarian for follow up care so that your pet can be checked for any re-growth or complications. In some cases it is impossible to remove the entire growth during a preliminary surgery, so it may be necessary for your doctor to repeat some procedures or provide additional care. Because it is possible for humans to become infected with rhinosporidiosis, it is important to practice good hygiene at all times.

"Frostbite is tissue damage caused by extreme cold. It happens when blood flow to the affected area is significantly decreased, and it results in injuries similar to thermal burns.
"
"Frostbite usually occurs when the body’s natural response to low temperature causes blood flow to be redirected away from the extremities and toward the center of the body. This process protects vital organs, such as the heart, when the body is in danger of becoming too cold. However, it leaves the extremities, which are less critical to survival, unprotected by the oxygenation and warmth provided by blood.
"
"The most commonly affected areas of the body are those furthest from the heart including:
"
"Ear tips
"
"Tail
"
"Toes
"
"Nose
"
"Scrotum
"
"These regions are also more exposed to wind and moisture, which can contribute to and intensify the development of frostbite.
"
"Frostbite itself is not usually a cause of death but can occur in conjunction with hypothermia (low body temperature), which is often life-threatening. Tissue that is damaged by frostbite can become infected or even gangrenous, which can lead to a whole-body (systemic) infection.
"
"Because of the likelihood of complications, if frostbite is suspected, the dog should be taken immediately to an emergency veterinarian for evaluation and treatment.
"
"Frostbite can occur in as little as 15 minutes, or it can take several hours or even days to develop.
"
"The onset of symptoms can vary greatly depending on the characteristics of the dog, such as the amount of hair, its size, age, and health status.
"
"Temperature and concurrent exposure to wind and moisture greatly affect the onset of symptoms. Higher elevations may contribute to faster development of frostbite because of decreased oxygen in the air. 
"
"Frostbite in dogs is usually identified by discoloration of the skin, which is often pale, blue, or gray in the initial stages. Once the tissue begins to warm, it may become swollen, reddened, and blistered. A moist discharge may be present. In severe cases, the tissue may turn black, which indicates that it has become necrotic (dead).
"
"Frostbite in dogs may include:
"
"Pain when touched
"
"Cold, brittle-feeling skin
"
"Discolored skin—often pale, blue, gray, or even black
"
"Swelling and redness once tissue is warmed
"
"Blistered or ulcerated skin
"
"The presence of ice around the affected area
"
"Low body temperature due to concurrent hypothermia
"
"Frostbite can occur at any temperature of freezing or below. 
"
"The temperature at which frostbite develops varies depending on the characteristics of the dog, concurrent weather conditions, and the immediate environment.
"
"In a smaller short-haired dog, the development of symptoms is expected to be similar to that of humans. For example, when the temperature is zero degrees Fahrenheit or below, it can take about 30 minutes for exposed tissue to get frostbite. At 15 degrees below zero, it would take approximately 15 minutes. In windy or moist conditions, frostbite can develop within 30 minutes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
"
"In a healthy, cold-weather breed such as a Siberian Husky, frostbite would take longer to occur and would be less likely to occur at higher freezing temperatures. However, even dogs bred to withstand cold weather are susceptible to frostbite, especially in moist or windy conditions.
"
"Moisture in the environment, such as wet bedding, does not allow for proper air flow or warming, making frostbite more likely to develop. Similarly, wind inhibits the body’s ability to stay warm.
"
"Higher elevations, which have less oxygen in the air, can affect tissue oxygenation, making frostbite more likely to develop at warmer freezing temperatures.
"
"Dogs with underlying diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, can have impaired circulation, making them more likely to develop frostbite. Very young dogs cannot regulate their own body temperature effectively, so they are also at increased risk. Very old dogs are likely to have decreased muscle mass, which affects the body’s ability to warm itself, making them more susceptible to frostbite and hypothermia.
"
"Frostbite is generally diagnosed based on physical examination findings. The presence of discolored and/or devitalized tissue in conjunction with low body temperature is very likely due to frostbite.
"
"Recent exposure to cold temperatures, especially in combination with a moist environment, wind exposure, and/or concurrent illness, will also help a veterinarian to establish the diagnosis.
"
"Because frostbite is usually identifiable with information from a physical exam and history findings, laboratory tests are generally not needed for a diagnosis. However, a veterinarian may recommend blood tests to evaluate for systemic infection or other illnesses that may impair healing. A culture and sensitivity may be recommended if infection or tissue death is present. If the history is uncertain or if the appearance of the affected areas is atypical, a biopsy may be recommended.
"
"If you suspect that your dog has frostbite, you should immediately take them to the vet. You should keep your dog warm with the car heater and/or a warm towel. You can gently warm the affected areas with slightly warm (not hot) water or a moist towel.
"
"It is important not to rub the skin or attempt to warm it with direct heat such as a hairdryer or heating pad, because this can worsen the tissue damage.
"
"Once the vet has examined your dog, they will treat hypothermia first, if present. They will then slowly re-warm the frostbitten tissue. This process is painful to the dog, so pain medications will be administered. They will also treat any secondary infections with antibiotics and/or topical antiseptics and prescribe medication for pain management.
"
"Severely affected areas may require surgery to remove nonviable tissue. If a very large area is affected, amputation may be necessary. Because it can take days to weeks for the full extent of damage to become apparent, surgical procedures will likely not be performed at the time of diagnosis.
"
"The time frostbite takes to heal depends on the severity of the tissue damage. Mild cases that have blood flow quickly re-established may heal within a few days.
"
"More severe cases will often appear to get worse before they get better, as the extent of the injury presents itself. This process may take several days to over a week. Severe cases may take months to heal, and affected dogs are often left with permanent cosmetic damage.
"
"If affected tissue has died (become necrotic), it will likely require surgery. Very severe cases that affect a large amount of skin or deeper tissues may require amputation.
"
"Frostbite can be prevented by keeping dogs indoors during cold weather. Dogs should not be left outside for extended periods of time when the weather is very cold. If they do spend time outside during cold weather, they must have access to warm, dry bedding in a wind-protected area; however, this should be for temporary protection only, not as an alternative to keeping the dog indoors. Similarly, dog clothes such as sweaters and boots may help keep dogs warm for short periods of time, but should not be used as a substitute for keeping dogs indoors.
"
"Dogs can get frostbite at any temperature of freezing or below.
"
"Frostbite looks like discolored skin, which may be blue, gray, black, or red. Affected skin may be blistered and may have a weepy or infected discharge.
"
"Dogs can recover from minor cases of frostbite within a few days. Many cases of frostbite will result in permanent cosmetic damage. Severe cases may require medical and surgical intervention. In extreme cases, amputation may be necessary.

"Fungal infections in dogs—specifically those caused by the fungus Aspergillus—are opportunistic organisms that are found everywhere in the environment, though they are more associated with compost piles, decaying soil, and standing water.
"
"Fungal infections in dogs are painful, can be itchy, and are extremely frustrating. Many symptoms of fungal infections are vague and can often be mistaken for other conditions.
"
"Though uncommon, fungal infections are considered a medical emergency. Unfortunately, by the time symptoms are noted for some dogs, the disease is already so advanced that humane euthanasia may be recommended.
"
"Nasal aspergillosis is caused by fungi shedding spores called conidia. These spores can be inhaled and cause a localized infection that appears as thick, smelly pus coming from the nose.
"
"Another type of this fungus—if not cleared by the immune system through making mucus or sneezing—can infect the respiratory system, get into the bloodstream, and spread throughout the body affecting multiple organs. This is called disseminated aspergillosis.
"
"Dogs with the disseminated form of aspergillosis are often terminally ill and can’t be cured. Dogs with the disseminated form often show symptoms related to which organs the fungus has attacked.
"
"Dogs may have:
"
"Fever
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Weakness
"
"Muscle wasting and weight loss
"
"Spinal pain
"
"Lameness
"
"Lack of coordination and balance (ataxia)
"
"Draining tracts: open sores in the skin that leak fluid
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes
"
"Coughing
"
"Inflammation (swelling) of the eyes and vision problems
"
"Neurologic signs
"
"Dog with nasal aspergillosis can also have neurologic signs such as seizures, behavioral changes, and head pressing. However, they more often show the following:
"
"Greenish-yellow-red (bloody) nasal discharge from one or both nostrils
"
"Tears in the skin of the nostrils with loss of skin color
"
"Facial muscle wasting
"
"Facial and nasal pain, shown by pawing at the nose
"
"Sneezing
"
"Respiratory distress
"
"Eye discharge and bulging of the eyes
"
"Dogs of any age, sex, or breed can become infected by Aspergillus.
"
"However, young or middle-aged dolichocephalic (long-nosed) breeds such as Greyhounds, Collies, and Dachshunds are more often affected by nasal aspergillosis, as well as German Shepherds and Rottweilers.
"
"Sporotrichosis is a fungal disease that affects the skin, respiratory system, bones and sometimes the brain. Infection is caused by the virtually ubiquitous dimorphic (mold and yeast) fungus, Sporothrix schenckii, which typically infects via direct inoculation - that is, through abrasions of the skin or by inhalation. The origin of the fungus is environmental; it is naturally found in soil, plants and sphagnum moss, but it can be communicated zoonotically between different animal species, and between animals and humans.
"
"In dogs, the disease occurs more commonly in hunting dogs because of the increased likelihood of puncture wounds associated with thorns or splinters.
"
"Cutaneous sporotrichosis 
"
"Disseminated sporotrichosis
"
"Pulmonary sporotrichosis
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.
"
"It is important to note that this is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it is communicable to humans and other animals, and proper precautions will need to be taken to prevent the spread of infection. Even if you do not have a break in your skin, you are not protected against acquiring the disease.
"
"An examination of the fluid from the lesions is often necessary to confirm an infection. In dogs, special fungal stains may aid in the diagnosis, but a negative finding does not rule out the disease. Laboratory cultures of the deeply affected tissue often require surgery to obtain an adequate sample. These samples will be sent for analysis, along with a special note to the laboratory listing sporotrichosis as a differential diagnosis. Secondary bacterial infections are common.
"
"
"
"Because of its potential for infection in humans, your dog may be hospitalized for the initial treatment. In many situations, outpatient therapy may be a consideration. Several antifungal drugs are available for treatment of this infection. Your veterinarian will choose the type that is best suited to your dog. The treatment generally takes some time; at least several weeks after the initial treatment before the patient is considered recovered.
"
"Although difficult to prevent because of its prevalence in the environment, it is helpful to determine the source of the Sporothrix schenckii, so that you can take steps to prevent repeat infections.
"
"Your veterinarian will set up a schedule of follow-up appointments at around every 2–4 weeks in order to re-evaluate your dog. Clinical signs will be monitored and liver enzymes will be assessed. Side effects associated with treatment will be evaluated, and treatment will be adapted according to your dog's reactions. If your dog does not respond to therapy, your veterinarian will make changes in the medication.

"Female German Shepherds from 2 to 8 years of age are most often diagnosed with disseminated aspergillosis.
"
"A physical exam of the nose and face—looking for signs of pain, symmetry, and air flow from both nostrils—will be a first step toward diagnosis of a fungal infection in dogs. Bloodwork and urine testing may then be recommended, as fungal organisms have been found in urine.
"
"Imaging is often recommended, including:
"
"X-rays of the spine looking for evidence of bone destruction
"
"CT scans and skull X-rays to look for evidence of nasal and sinus bone destruction
"
"Rhinoscopy to directly visualize fungal growths in the sinus cavities
"
"Biopsies, serology, fungal PCR, and fungal cultures of samples taken are more specialized tests, but they are often needed for a sure diagnosis.
"
"Aspergillosis in dogs is slow to clear up. Antifungal medications often need to be given for months or years, and side effects of the drugs are common.
"
"These medications include:
"
"Ketoconazole
"
"Fluconazole
"
"Itraconazole
"
"Amphotericin B
"
"Voriconazole
"
"Posaconazole
"
"Supportive care —such as pain medications, secondary antibiotics, and intravenous (IV) fluids—is often used while treating the underlying cause.
"
"Recent studies have shown that dogs diagnosed with nasal aspergillosis saw an 80% success rate in curability with clotrimazole infusions and surgical removal of as much fungus and aspergilloma as possible.
"
"However, nasal aspergillosis infection is often never 100% cleared, even with treatment.
"
"Because dogs with disseminated aspergillosis are often very sick, many will either be humanely euthanized or die from the disease before medical treatment has a chance to work.
"
"The outlook for dogs with nasal aspergillosis is uncertain and depends on the severity and amount of bone destruction. Dogs with neurologic symptoms are most likely to have a brain infection.
"
"Dogs with disseminated fungal infections have a poorer outlook, because they are often very sick at the time the veterinarian sees them. However, some studies have mentioned average survival times of greater than a year.
"
"Dogs infected with nasal fungal infections often see their nasal discharge and symptoms clear up around two weeks after treatment. However, some persistent nasal discharge and sneezing may still happen because of the damage caused. Some dogs may need another procedure if the first doesn’t fully work.
"
"Follow-up CT scans and rhinoscopy are needed to see if full healing takes place.
"
"Some infections may not be cleared up until years after therapy, so recurrence is possible. However, once cleared of infection, dogs are unlikely to become infected again.
"
"Unfortunately, most fungal infections in dogs cannot be prevented, but as Aspergillus fungi often are more prevalent in decaying soils and compost, the best thing you can do is not allow your pup access to these areas.
"
"Additionally, since Aspergillus is opportunistic in nature, dogs that are immunocompromised are at greatest risk. Take extra precautions when your dog is around other dogs, outside for a walk, pregnant, or receiving steroids or chemotherapy.
"
"Given that symptoms are often similar, most of the time you won't be able to tell if your dog has a fungal or bacterial infection. Dogs can even have both types of infections at once. Diagnostic tests like cultures and cytologies are often needed to differentiate between the two.

"On occasion, a dog's front leg continues to grow well after the other has stopped, resulting in one normal-sized leg and another irregularly-sized leg. This is commonly referred to as an antebrachial growth deformity. When this occurs the shorter leg's bone may twist and bow, or it overgrows at the elbow. In either case, the result is misalignment of the bones. The tendency of a joint to stop growing seems to be a recessive trait in Skye Terriers. There is also the possibility of elbow joint misalignment in basset hounds and Lhasa Apsos.
"
"Another front leg deformity which commonly occurs is called elbow dysplasia. It occurs when the point of the elbow and the muscular structure do not develop normally, and is most commonly seen in large and giant-breed dogs, especially Bernese Mountain Dogs, Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, and Rottweilers. Males are also more susceptible to the condition. This deformity becomes apparent at the fifth to the eighth month and is usually in both elbows.
"
"Longer-limbed dogs are more likely to suffer deformities of the longer bones, whereas shorter-limbed dogs tend to develop more joint problems. The age of the animal when the deformity occurs will also affect the severity of the condition.
"
"There are many potential causes for front leg deformities in dogs; some of the more common ones include:
"
"Your veterinarian will order X-rays of the entire limb, including the elbow, to compare the lengths of the bones, and to determine whether the muscles in the elbow are attached. Other signs the veterinarian may look for in the X-rays to confirm antebrachial growth deformities are bone enlargement, inflammation of the entire bone structure, and flexor muscle spasms.
"
"  
"
"
"
"If your veterinarian determines that the deformity is due to a genetic predisposition, breeding of the dog will be discouraged. If the deformity is due to an injury, however, your veterinarian will probably recommend surgery to repair the damage -- removing any abnormal cartilage or bone and returning the joint to its normal function. Arthroscopic removal may have advantages over a surgical incision into the joint (arthrotomy), particularly regarding removal of fragmented coronoid process (FCP).
"
"If surgery is needed, special care will be necessary for several weeks after your dog is brought home, such as controlling it's lean body weight, monitoring its pain, and the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Therefore, it may be best to confine your pet in a cage to help limit any strenuous activity.
"
"Otherwise, adjust diet supplements (especially in larger dogs) as advised and keep the animal at its recommended weight. In addition, joint misalignment may lead to arthritic pain, so seek your veterinarian's advice to alleviate the dog's pain.

"Dogs can experience a forelimb issue (sometimes referred to as brachial plexus avulsion) when they are hurt from jumping, have been in a road accident, had a traumatic fall, or have been caught in or on something. The possibility of spinal cord injury, or other severe damage, requires that an examination and assessment be made by a veterinarian. Prompt medical attention is advised.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Dogs that are experiencing this condition will often exhibit muscular weakness, absence of pain perception, loss of shoulder movement, and the inability to put weight on their paws.
"
"The most common cause of a foreleg injury is often a road accident, a serious fall, or if the dog gets a foot caught in or on something while jumping.
"
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computer tomography (CT) scan may be used to examine the dog's body for internal lesions. The veterinarian will look for injuries to the spinal cord, or for any associated neurological issues.
"
"
"
"Treatment will be based on the severity of the injury. Bandaging the foreleg and protecting it from further injury is the most common response. Anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly given to decrease swelling. Amputation is sometimes required for injuries that cannot be repaired or under circumstances where the injury is life threatening.
"
"Clinical monitoring of the dog following treatment is recommended so that improvements to the injured site can be assessed. One of the most common suggestions is for the dog to be confined so that it will not further complicate the injury. Protective swaddling, or binding, is also recommended for keeping the limb in place. Physical therapy may be prescribed for regaining muscle strength during rehabilitation. It is important to observe the dog's behavior following treatment as there is a potential for infection if the dog rubs its paws repeatedly on the ground. Also, it is important to deter the dog from mutilating itself in an attempt to stop the pain and associated healing sensations. Most cases will resolve within a few months of the initial prognosis and treatment.
"
"There are currently no preventative measures for this medical issue.

"The maxilla forms the upper jaw (maxilla) and holds the upper teeth in place, whereas, the mandible, also called the jawbone, forms the lower jaw and holds the lower teeth in place.
"
"Fractures of the upper jaw and lower jaw (mandible) are mostly seen in dogs due to injury or trauma.
"
"Symptoms vary greatly depending upon the type, location, extent, and cause of injury. Some of the more common ones include:
"
"Although various types of injuries and trauma are typically responsible for fractures of the upper and lower jaw, certain risk factors may predispose a dog to the fractures, including oral infections (e.g., periodontal disease, osteomyelitis), certain metabolic diseases (e.g., hypoparathyroidism), and congenital or hereditary factors resulting in a weakened or deformed jaw.
"
"You will need first be asked for a thorough history of your dog’s health, including any injuries or traumas it may have sustained in the past. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, closely examining the oral cavity, jaw bones, teeth, and other related structures. X-rays of the oral cavity are also used to determine the location and extent of the fracture.
"
"
"
"Surgery is most often used to repair the fracture. However, there are several methods to accomplish the surgical repair. Your dog’s veterinarian will give his or her expert opinion based on the type of fracture, available equipment, supplies, and the pros and cons of performing each option. The ultimate goal of surgical intervention is to reduce the fracture, establish the natural occlusion of bones and teeth, and stabilize the fracture to enhance the healing process. Pain killers and antibiotics are also prescribed to control pain and infections, respectively.
"
"Overall prognosis depends on type, extent, location of trauma, quality of home care, and selection of treatment modality. Healing typically takes 4 to 12 weeks, and thus, requires good owner compliance during the treatment period to aid in healing.
"
"Wax is often prescribed to be applied over irritating wires used during surgery. And oral irrigants are used for oral hygiene and to reduce the number of bacteria in the oral cavity. After surgery, your dog will feel very sore and will need painkillers for a few days. Good pain management will help in the healing process; this involves administering pain killers at the prescribed dosage and time.
"
"A postoperative evaluation, including X-rays, will be done after to weeks to see if the fracture has been stabilized and is healing well. There is always a chance of refracture after the support has been removed, so extra care will be needed to prevent such a recurrence. Provide good cage rest and minimize any risk of trauma. Don’t allow other pets to come in contact with your dog and keep it in noise-free environment.
"
"Also, due to the involvement of the oral cavity, ingestion and chewing of food is highly painful and difficult. You will need to maintain the recommended nutritional and fluid diet during the healing process, paying extra attention to your dog’s weight. Soft food is recommended for easy chewing and ingestion.
"
"Cysticercosis is a rare disease caused by the larvae Taenia crassiceps, a type of tapeworm. Once the eggs (which is suspected to be found in the feces of infected foxes) are ingested by rabbits or other rodents, it develops in the abdominal and subcutaneous tissues, and eventually forms large masses of cysticerci (larval form) in the abdominal cavity, lungs, muscles, and in the tissues under the skin. Even worse, the cysticercus is capable of undergoing asexual reproduction and multiplying a high rate.
"
"It is rarely reported in Europe or the United States, but often occurs in olders dogs or young immuno-compromised pups.
"
"Cysticerci masses may found under the skin or in other organs, causing several complications including:
"
"Mode of infection not clear, but three are hypothesized:
"
"  
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel. X-rays will help to determine the degree of spread to the internal organs, and an ultrasound will differentiate these masses from cancers, which are solid.
"
"
"
"Surgery is necessary to remove the larval masses. However, depending on how severe the secondary symptoms are, your veterinarian may need to stabilize and hospitalize the animal first.
"
"Fortunately, the stages in which dogs display clinical signs are not zoonotic, so owners should not fear of contracting the worms from his or her dog. However, your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to examine the dog and monitor (often with abdominal ultrasounds) for the potential spread of lesions and the development of new lesions in different sites.

"The esophagus is a long, narrow, muscular tube that connects the mouth and the stomach, and is the passage through which food travels. Problems can occur when pets eat things they shouldn’t. Anything a dog swallows can become stuck in the esophagus, but typically items that get stuck are rough, irregularly shaped objects or things too large to pass through.
"
"If you suspect your dog has something stuck in the throat, he should be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately, especially if he appears short of breath, weak, has blue-gray gums, or is struggling to breath or breathing rapidly.
"
"If an object lodges in the esophagus, at first a dog may appear to be in distress and uncomfortable but still breathe normally. This is because the esophagus is not involved in breathing. However, an object lodged in the back of the mouth or upper part of the esophagus can put pressure on the windpipe (trachea) and soon cause problems in breathing.
"
"In addition, esophageal obstructions can lead to many complications if not treated promptly. Left untreated, objects may create holes in the esophagus, which in some instances can allow air or fluid to build up around the lungs and lead to breathing issues.
"
"When an obstruction occurs, it can be full or partial.
"
"A full obstruction occurs when food or water cannot pass around the object to reach the stomach. Signs and symptoms are more obvious when the esophagus is completely blocked, as compared to a partial obstruction.
"
"A partial obstruction occurs when a smaller object gets lodged in the esophagus, and some food and water is still able to pass the object and get to the stomach.  Partial obstructions are still an emergency, and can sometimes be more difficult to recognize. That’s because symptoms may not be as obvious as they are in dogs with a full or complete esophageal obstruction.  
"
"Dogs with a full obstruction will spit up food or water, but this may not occur until several hours after they have ingested the object. Bones are the most common objects that become stuck in the esophagus. Other objects include nylabones, rawhide, dental chews, sharp objects such as fishing hooks or sewing needles, or even large pieces of food.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Symptoms of obstruction include:
"
"Gulping or repeated attempts to swallow
"
"Gagging, retching, coughing
"
"Repeated attempts to vomit without being able to bring anything up 
"
"Decreased interest in eating and/or drinking 
"
"Smacking/licking the lips 
"
"Drooling (there may or may not be blood in the drool) 
"
"Pawing at the mouth or face 
"
"Vomiting or regurgitation (may be delayed several hours after eating) 
"
"Pacing/restlessness 
"
"Lethargy 
"
"Pain with movement, especially when moving the head and neck  
"
"Diagnosing this condition usually involves taking x-rays of the entire chest/neck to look for the object in the throat. Some objects show up well on x-rays, while others can be more difficult to see. If your veterinarian suspects an object is stuck in the esophagus but cannot see it on x-ray, they may:
"
"Recommend using contrast dye and retake x-rays
"
"Snaking an endoscope down the esophagus
"
"Perform a CT scan of the neck/chest to evaluate the esophagus  
"
"These tests will be used to determine the object’s location and whether there is damage to the esophageal tissue near the object.  It also allows them to determine if there are any defects in the esophagus that may allow air, fluid, and/or infection to build up in local tissues or to leak into the space around the lungs.  Your veterinarian may also recommend additional diagnostics like bloodwork to evaluate the health of your dog.
"
"Treating esophageal obstructions in dogs depends on the type of object, its location, and how long the object has been stuck. Regardless of the method, general anesthesia is required.
"
"For most esophageal obstructions, veterinarians prefer endoscopy. This uses a long, narrow tube equipped with a camera at the tip, as well as tools to maneuver a foreign object. It is especially useful for things like fish hooks or other sharp objects that often catch in soft tissues. The camera can help the vet assess damage to plan further treatment.
"
"A vet may try a procedure called blind retrieval, in which long forceps grab the object to remove it through the mouth. If this is not possible, the vet may try to gently push the object through the esophagus to the stomach. Once in the stomach, the object may pass on its own and eventually end up in the pet’s stool.
"
"If there are concerns the object may not pass through the digestive tract on its own, or should not be allowed to pass on its own, surgery may be performed to remove the object from the stomach (gastrotomy). This type of surgery tends to be easier than surgery on the esophagus. Esophagostomy may be recommended if the object cannot be pushed to the stomach or if there are concerns about significant damage to the esophagus. Esophagostomy is a surgery that involves approaching the object through the neck and cutting into the esophagus to remove the object. 
"
"Even with the object’s removal, the esophagus may need time and treatment to heal. Damage can lead to inflammation (esophagitis). The longer an object is left stuck in the esophagus, the higher the chances of esophagitis developing. In mild cases, a dog may be treated with antacids, gastrointestinal protectants, and pain medication for a few weeks, along with a softened diet.
"
"In more severe cases, scar tissue can form, resulting in a stricture, or narrowing of the esophagus. If a stricture forms, a dog may experience future issues with difficulty swallowing and it may lead to a condition called megaesophagus.
"
"In cases where there are concerns about more severe damage, to prevent complications, a dog may be started on additional medications to reduce the production of stomach acid and enhance gastrointestinal protection. Pain medications and antibiotics may be prescribed. In some cases, a feeding tube may be used for two to three weeks.  
"
"The cost to treat an esophageal foreign body varies greatly based on your location in the country, the object that is stuck, how long the object has been stuck, and the method used to retrieve it. 
"
"For objects that have been stuck for a short period of time and are retrieved using endoscopy, cost can range between $750-$1,500.
"
"For objects that have been stuck for a longer period of time, complicated cases, or cases that require surgery, cost can range between $1,500-$3,000.  
"
"After the object’s removal, many dogs develop esophagitis, which is inflammation of the esophagus. This is managed by medications such omeprazole to reduce stomach acid production. Gastrointestinal protectants such as sucralfate may be prescribed to protect damaged esophageal tissue. Metoclopramide is also often prescribed to reduce the likelihood of stomach acid refluxing into the esophagus.  
"
"Other medications include pain medications, anti-nausea medications, appetite stimulants, and antibiotics. In addition, your veterinarian may recommend a canned, soft, or moistened diet for two to three weeks while the tissues heal, fed in smaller, more frequent meals.  
"
"If there is a lot of damage to the esophagus, a feeding tube may be placed for two to three weeks to give the esophagus time to heal. Your veterinarian will likely recommend a special liquid diet and will demonstrate proper feeding tube care if one is placed.  
"
"Most dogs make a full recovery. In some instances, a dog may develop a stricture (narrowing) within the esophagus that makes it difficult for food to pass through the esophagus. In these cases, long-term feeding and dietary modifications may be recommended to help manage complications like megaesophagus, in which the esophagus becomes enlarged and cannot move food easily.
"
"It can be difficult to tell if there is something stuck in your dog’s esophagus, but if you notice the following, take your dog to the vet immediately:
"
"Suddenly acting agitated, anxious, or restless
"
"Repeatedly swallowing, gagging, or coughing
"
"Pawing at their mouth
"
"Excessive drooling (which may contain blood)
"
"Seeming uncomfortable when moving their head or neck around
"
"The sooner an esophageal foreign body is treated, the better the chances for a quick and complete recovery. Dogs tend to do best if esophageal foreign bodies are removed within 24 hours.  
"
"Do not let your dog chew on bones, as they are the most common object to get stuck in the esophagus. It is also important to monitor how your dog does with treats designed to encourage chewing, such as dental treats or chews. If you notice your dog tends to break off large pieces of these treats and swallow them whole, it is best to avoid them. Also, monitor how they do with these types of treats when they get close to having them completely chewed. If they tend to try to swallow the last remaining piece, it is best to take it away.

"Food allergies are an immune response to ingredients in a dog's diet—an ingredient they are allergic to. This immune response usually becomes apparent over a prolonged amount of time rather than immediately after they try a food for the first time. Most dogs with true food allergies are actually allergic to a specific protein rather than a grain, as many assume. However, dogs can also be allergic to any ingredient in the diet itself.
"
"Lymphedema is a medical in which localized fluid retention and tissue swelling are caused by a compromised lymphatic system. The watery fluid, also known as lymph, contains white blood cells and circulates throughout the lymphatic system and typically collects into interstitial spaces, especially subcutaneous fat.
"
"Congential forms of the disease has been reported in bulldogs and poodles, as well as Labrador retrievers and Old English sheepdogs.
"
"The fluid accumulation (edema) is usually not painful and pits; that is, a depression develops if the skin is pushed with a finger (which eventually disappears if fibrosis occurs). Limb swelling, meanwhile, is present at birth or develops in the first several months. The swelling may be affect one or several limbs, and typically begins at the end of the limb and slowly moves upwards. In some cases, lameness and pain may also develop.
"
"Hereditary and congenital (present at birth) forms of lymphedema are caused by malformations of the lymphatic system, such as aplasia, valvular incompetence, and lymph node fibrosis. Other potential causes include heart disease, trauma to the lymphatic vessels or lymph nodes, and heat or radiation exposure.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal.
"
"The most reliable test used to diagnose this condition, however, is called lymphography. This imaging examination uses a contrast substance, which is injected directly into the lymphatic system, to better visualize the affected region before taking X-rays.
"
"
"
"Although there is currently no cure available for lymphedema, a number of medical and surgical treatments have been attempted with variable outcomes. Long-term application of pressure wraps and antibiotics to prevent infections may be successful in some patients, while rest and massage seem to not help in treating the condition. There are also various surgical techniques that are used to treat lymphedema, but none have demonstrated consistent results.
"
"As there is no cure available, most veterinarians focus on alleviating secondary symptoms and complications such as lameness. Severe forms of lymphedema may be fatal for the dog; however, there are cases in which puppies with pelvic limp involvement fully recover.

"When a dog with food allergies encounters a specific food they are allergic to, their immune system sees that protein as a foreign substance and mounts an immune system attack. This commonly causes itching, redness, and swelling. Food allergies are less common than environmental allergies, such as seasonal allergies and flea/tick allergies. In fact, only 0.2% of dogs are actually affected by food allergies.
"
"Itchy skin
"
"Frequent ear infections/skin infections
"
"Hives
"
"Licking/chewing feet
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Vomiting
"
"Weight loss
"
"Seizure disorders (rare) 
"
"Food allergies are caused by an overenthusiastic immune system reaction to specific protein. The immune system mistakenly treats the protein like a foreign substance and kicks into gear. This leads to inflammation, which causes physical changes in the dog's body, such as redness, swelling, itching, and increased tear or other fluid production, while the immune system tries to get rid of the “foreign” substance. This fluid production can be in the gastrointestinal tract as well, leading to diarrhea and/or vomiting.
"
"There is a genetic component to all allergies. However, the exact mechanism of why allergies develop in some dogs and not in others is not fully understood.
"
"Dogs can have allergies from an early age or they can develop them several years into life. While allergies can occur in any breed of dog at any age, some are more likely to have food allergies. Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, English Springer Spaniels, Cocker Spaniels, Collies, Miniature Schnauzers, and Shar-Pei are more prone to develop food allergies.
"
"There are several ingredients that are often linked to food allergies in dogs. The most common allergy is to a specific protein, but many dogs are allergic to more than one food ingredient.  The following have been commonly linked to food allergies in dogs:
"
"Chicken
"
"Beef
"
"Dairy
"
"Wheat
"
"Soy
"
"Eggs
"
"Dogs are most often diagnosed with food allergies based on a physical exam, clinical signs, and their response to a food trial.
"
"Your dog’s veterinarian may recommend that you complete a food trial with your pet. Food trials last eight to 12 weeks and must be followed exactly as prescribed. Be sure not to give any treats or other diets that may disrupt the results of the trial. Talk to your veterinarian about which heartworm and flea/tick prevention products are best during this time, as many have added beef or chicken protein for flavor. There are various ways that a food trial can be approached:
"
"A prescription hydrolyzed protein diet. These diets have broken their proteins down to small particles so that they are unable to bind to the receptor and initiate the immune response.
"
" An elimination diet. These diets have a single source protein/carbohydrate, and are either formulated by a veterinary nutritionist or are home-cooked diets made under the direction of a veterinarian.
"
"Most elimination diets are not suitable for long-term feeding, and instead are used only to diagnose food allergies. If your dog’s skin/ear issues resolve, then you know that your dog has a food allergy and can move forward in finding a diet that they will thrive on long-term.
"
"Novel “new,” protein/carbohydrate source diets. This is food that has unusual protein or carbohydrate sources and limited ingredients that may cause an allergic reaction.
"
"Skin support diets. These are fortified with bioactives and phytonutrients to minimize the immune system's response.
"
"Food trials or elimination diets are the best way to diagnose food allergies. There are diagnostic tests on the market, but many questions remain regarding their accuracy.
"
"Most food allergies are treated with a change in diet. It is very common for dogs with food allergies to also have environmental allergies. They may be prescribed allergy medications like Apoquel®, Cytopoint®, antihistamines, or steroids, in addition to a special diet.
"
"Several supplements may be beneficial to dogs with allergies as well. These include omega fatty acids to boost the natural barrier function of the skin, and products including:
"
"Many diets on the market can help to manage your dog’s allergies. Allergies are specific to the individual dog, so there is no one “best diet.” The best diet is the food that contains ingredients that your dog is not allergic to and is balanced and formulated for optimal health. The following list includes several diets that many allergy dogs have found relief with, including:
"
"Food allergies cannot be cured, but they can be well-managed long term with appropriate diet therapy and avoidance of allergic ingredients. If your dog has a food allergy, be sure to watch dog food labels closely, especially with treats, so you don’t accidentally give them anything considered allergenic. Prescription treats EW on the market, and some pet parents find it helpful to use raw baby carrots or green beans for treats in a pinch.
"
"If your dog has food allergies and is undergoing a diet trial, expect it to last eight to 12 weeks before you can see an improvement. Reduction in licking and chewing may be seen in the first four weeks, but other dogs may take up to 12 weeks before you see any improvement.
"
"The most common food allergy in dogs is protein.
"
"The most common signs of food allergies in dogs are itching, frequent skin and ear infections, and chewing/licking of the feet.
"
"Dogs are tested for food allergies by using diet trials, generally under the guidance of a veterinarian.
"
"Food allergies cannot be cured. However, they can be well-managed with an appropriate diet and avoidance of allergic ingredients.

"Intussusception refers to an inflammation of the intestines, a portion of the intestine that has slipped out of its normal place (prolapse), and a portion of the intestine that has folded (invagination). This change in the shape of the intestine can cause the affected portion of the intestine to slip into an adjoining cavity or duct in the body.
"
"While intussusception can occur in animals of all ages, it is more common in younger animals that have weaker immune systems. In affected animals, around 80 percent are younger than one year of age, and in dogs, the affected age tends to be three months or younger. The exact mechanism behind this medical condition is unknown. This obstruction can be either partial or complete, but the occurrence of an intussusception eventually leads to a mechanical obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.
"
"The clinical signs associated with the intussusception will depend on the anatomic region of the intussusception. If the intussusceptions occur in the gastroesophageal regions -- where the stomach and esophagus are located -- the signs are typically much more severe than if they occur in other regions. Called gastroesophageal intussusception (GEI), this form appears most frequently in the German shepherd dog.
"
"In addition, if there is a total obstruction, the animal will have severe complications potentially and symptoms that are more severe. Whether partial or complete, obstruction of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to hypovolemia, dehydration, and compromise of the venous and/or lymphatic systems. Prolonged obstruction can lead to necrosis (death of the tissue) and disruption of the normal capacity of the mucosal barrier that protects the GI tract, allowing bacteria and toxins to be absorbed into the GI tract.
"
"Other common symptoms can include:
"
"Intussusception high in the intestinal tract
"
"Intussusception low in the intestinal tract
"
"It can be challenging to isolate the exact cause, as any disease that can alter gastrointestinal motility can lead to an intussusception. Some of the most common causes include: enteritis, recent abdominal surgery, intestinal mural disease, intestinal parasites, a foreign object in the tract, and intense contractions of the bowel portion of the intestine.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.
"
"While some intussusceptions can be chronic in nature, a chronic history of vomiting and/or diarrhea does not necessarily confirm an intussusception. Imaging is often used to properly view the intestines for any possible other causes. This may show an object in the intestinal tract, or a mass of tissue. Your veterinarian may also choose to use a contrasting agent -- a solution that is highlighted in X-ray -- that is either injected or fed to your dog, so that it can be tracked as it  progresses through the intestinal tract, allowing your doctor to view any abnormal turns of obstructions.
"
"A fecal sample will be taken to check for intestinal parasites, and the electrolyte balances will be checked. In the case of intussusception that are high in the gastrointestinal tract, electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and hyponatremia are not uncommon.
"
"
"
"Immediate and aggressive intravenous fluid treatment will need to be given if your dog is dehydrated, and your dog's electrolyte imbalances will need to be treated as well. Your veterinarian will initially work on stabilizing your dog and addressing any signs of dehydration before working on other treatment plans. A sodium solution may also be given if your dog is found to have hyponatremia. Following any surgical procedure, it is recommended that you limit your dog's daily activity until a complete recovery has taken place. Antibiotics are often administered to reduce the likelihood of a potential infection developing.
"
"In the case where a foreign object is found to be causing the obstruction, or a complete block is present, surgery will need to be initiated to correct the issue. If your veterinarian believes the intestinal tissue is ulcerated as a result of the irritation, medications can be prescribed to encourage healing and prevent infection.
"
"It is important to maintain fluids following the surgical procedure to prevent dehydration. Most recurrence issues occur within the first several weeks of the animal's surgery, so this is the time for more careful observation. Your doctor will advise you on an appropriate diet for the days following surgery or treatment. Generally, they will be small, easily digestible meals for the first several days, and depending on your dog's recovery, the diet can return to normal once the issue has resolved.
"
"Vaccination against parvovirus have proven to be promising for some dogs in the prevention of this medical condition and others.

"Pulmonary edema, is the abnormal buildup of fluid in the lungs. In dogs, this condition is most associated with pneumonia, but many other health complications can lead to pulmonary edema in dogs.
"
"A small amount of fluid is necessary for normal lung function, as it facilitates the gas exchange that is needed to breathe. However, lung fluid content must be carefully balanced between the tiny air sacs (alveoli) and small blood vessels that nourish the lungs. If this balance is disrupted, too much fluid accumulates in the alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema.
"
"The alveoli are normally filled with air, and if the air is replaced with water, breathing becomes difficult. This can cause an affected dog to feel extreme distress. If left untreated, pulmonary edema in dogs can cause lung tissue damage.
"
"Fortunately, when the condition is treated quickly by a veterinarian, an affected dog typically has a good prognosis. However, this can depend on the underlying cause. Fluid in the lungs in dogs is a common complication of conditions such as respiratory infection and certain heart issues.
"
"Fluid in the lungs in dogs can accumulate slowly or quickly, and it is considered a veterinary emergency to ensure a dog’s oxygen supply isn’t compromised.
"
"An affected dog’s symptoms depend on their condition’s underlying cause. However, no matter the cause, fluid in the lungs affects breathing and heart function.
"
"Symptoms of fluid in the lungs in dogs typically include:
"
"Increased respiratory rate
"
"Open-mouth breathing
"
"Increased abdominal movement during breathing
"
"Coughing
"
"Wheezing
"
"Weakness
"
"Crackling noises during breathing
"
"Pale or blue lips, gums, or tongue
"
"Collapse
"
"Fluid in the lungs in dogs can be characterized as originating either from a heart condition (cardiogenic) or from another condition (noncardiogenic). Dogs of all ages, breeds, and genders are susceptible to pulmonary edema, but some are at a higher risk for certain conditions that lead to fluid in the lungs.
"
"Cardiogenic pulmonary edema occurs when a dog has advanced heart disease that causes left-sided congestive heart failure, in which the heart’s inability to pump effectively leads to blood accumulation in the vessels that carry blood away from the lungs.
"
"These conditions include:
"
"Degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD)—When the mitral valve, which is between the heart’s upper and lower left chambers, deteriorates, it can no longer close properly, allowing blood to flow backward.
"
"Dogs at higher risk for DMVD include:
"
"Cavalier King Charles Spaniels
"
"Chihuahuas
"
"Cocker Spaniels
"
"Miniature Schnauzers
"
"Pomeranians
"
"Dachshunds
"
"Pekingese
"
"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)—DCM is caused by heart muscle degeneration that causes the heart wall to thin and weaken, inhibiting the heart’s ability to pump blood.
"
"This is the most common cause of heart failure in large-breed dogs, including:
"
"Boxers
"
"Doberman Pinschers
"
"Great Danes
"
"Irish Wolfhounds
"
"Newfoundlands
"
"Saint Bernards
"
"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)—During fetal development, an opening called the ductus arteriosus is present between the two main blood vessels leading to the heart. The opening normally closes when puppies are born. PDA is a heart defect that occurs when this opening fails to close.
"
"This condition is more common in female dogs, and breeds at increased risk include:
"
"Maltese
"
"Pomeranians
"
"Cocker Spaniels
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Labrador Retrievers
"
"Heart issues are not always the reason a dog accumulates fluid in their lungs. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema can occur for several reasons, such as:
"
"Pneumonia
"
"Anemia
"
"Heartworm disease
"
"Airway obstruction
"
"Smoke inhalation
"
"Toxins
"
"Low blood protein levels
"
"Electrocution
"
"Altitude sickness
"
"Brain trauma
"
"Epileptic seizures
"
"Near drowning
"
"Cancer
"
"If your dog is showing signs that could indicate pulmonary edema, they should be examined by a veterinarian. Tests your vet may perform to diagnose fluid in the lungs in dogs include:
"
"History—A thorough history is important, and you need to let your veterinarian know if your dog has ingested a toxic substance, was bitten by a venomous snake, was exposed to smoke or high altitude, experienced an electrical shock, or any other relevant information that could help them diagnose the condition.
"
"Physical exam—Your veterinarian will perform a nose-to-tail physical exam to check your dog for abnormalities. Listening with a stethoscope to your dog’s heart and lung sounds is a crucial part of this exam, as abnormal respiratory noises can help your veterinarian determine how to proceed.
"
"Blood work—Blood work, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and biochemistry profile, provides useful information about your dog’s overall health and can help determine if an infection is present.
"
"Chest X-rays—Chest X-rays are extremely helpful for diagnosing pulmonary edema. These images can show the amount of fluid in your dog’s lungs, a foreign body that may cause an airway obstruction, or heart enlargement if your dog has cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
"
"Electrocardiogram (EKG)—Your veterinarian may perform an EKG to assess the electrical activity of your dog’s heart.
"
"Heart ultrasound—If your veterinarian suspects cardiogenic pulmonary edema, they may perform a heart ultrasound, often referred to as an echocardiogram, to evaluate your dog’s heart.
"
"Pulmonary fluid testing—Your veterinarian may take a sample of your dog’s pulmonary fluid through aspiration or bronchoscopy to test for infection or elevated protein levels.
"
"Treatment for pulmonary edema in dogs depends on whether your dog’s condition is cardiogenic or noncardiogenic.
"
"Let’s look at each possible situation:
"
"Cardiogenic—If your dog has fluid in their lungs caused by heart disease, your veterinarian will likely prescribe a diuretic medication to help remove the fluid. Other treatments include oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, rest, and diet change.
"
"Noncardiogenic—Treatment for pulmonary edema unrelated to a heart condition depends on the underlying cause. For example, if an airway obstruction is present, your vet may need to perform surgery to remove the object. If your dog has bacterial pneumonia, they may need antibiotics to help clear the infection. Other potential treatments for fluid in the lungs in dogs include anti-inflammatory medications and oxygen therapy.
"
"In a severe case of pulmonary edema, a vet may remove the accumulated fluid in a procedure called a thoracocentesis to help your dog breathe more easily. This process involves placing a needle or catheter in your dog’s chest to drain the fluid.
"
"Unfortunately, heart conditions such as DMVD and DCM are not curable, but they can be managed to keep pulmonary edema under control.
"
"If your dog has a heart condition, be sure to follow your veterinarian’s recommendations fully, schedule frequent rechecks, and monitor your pup for signs such as lethargy, decreased appetite, and difficulty breathing.
"
"In some noncardiogenic pulmonary edema cases, fluid in the lungs in dogs can resolve quickly while other issues can cause a prolonged recovery. In addition, pulmonary edema may recur, depending on the underlying cause.
"
"Allowing your dog time to rest and recover is crucial once the pulmonary edema is resolved.
"
"Hydronephrosis is usually one-sided and occurs secondary to complete or partial obstruction of the kidney or ureter by kidney stones, tumor, retroperitoneal (the anatomical space behind the abdominal cavity), disease, trauma, radiotherapy, and accidental binding of the ureter during spaying and after ectopic ureter surgery.
"
"In most patients, hydronephrosis occurs when fluid builds up in the kidney, causing progressive distention of the renal pelvis (the funnel-like dilated proximal part of the ureter in the kidney) and diverticula (out pouching, with atrophy of the kidney secondary to obstruction).
"
"Bilateral hydronephrosis (distention and dilation of the renal pelvis) is rare. When it does occur, it is usually secondary to trigonal (a triangular smooth area at the base of the bladder), prostatic, or urethral disease.
"
"Some dogs may be without overt symptoms, while others may display one or many of the following:
"
"Any cause of ureteral obstruction:
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian as much information on your dog's health and recent activities as possible. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog after taking a thorough medical history from you. Standard laboratory tests include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to rule out or confirm other causes of disease.
"
"Abdominal X-rays and an ultrasound are important tools for diagnosing hydronephrosis and its underlying cause. Also essential is a transurethral urethrocystoscopy or vaginoscopy, procedures that are performed using a small camera to visualize the inside of the vagina or the urethra (two tubes which drain from the kidneys to the bladder).
"
"   
"
"
"
"Your dog will be treated on an inpatient basis and will be started on supportive care (e.g., fluids and antibiotics) while diagnostic testing is performed. Correction of fluid and electrolyte deficits will be undertaken using intravenous fluid therapy over four to six hours, followed by maintenance fluids as needed. If your dog is exhibiting extreme polyuria, (excessive urination), higher maintenance fluid rates will be necessary for replacing those being excreted.
"
"Relieving the lower urinary tract obstruction as soon as possible by catheterization will be a foremost priority, along with serial cystocentesis.  Cystostomy is the surgical formation of an opening through the abdomen into the urinary bladder using a tube-like structure. Any obstructions should then be surgically corrected as soon as is possible.
"
"Your veterinarian will discuss with you the possible presence and implications of renal disease and the possible need for surgery should it be diagnosed. Specific treatment (usually surgical) depends on the cause of the disease and whether there is concurrent renal failure or other disease process at work (e.g., metastatic cancer).  Emergency surgery is rarely required for renal disease. Kidney removal is generally not necessary unless is is infected or cancerous. If mild disease is secondary to the kidney stones, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, which uses shock waves to break up the kidney stones, may be used as an alternative to surgery.
"
"Finish all prescribed medications to help prevent recurrence.
"
"In many cases, preventing fluid in the lungs in dogs isn’t possible. However, you can help reduce your pup’s pulmonary edema risk by following these tips:
"
"Keep your dog at a healthy weight to lower their risk of developing a heart condition.
"
"Schedule yearly or biannual wellness exams to help detect issues such as heart disease in the early stages, when they are easier to manage.
"
"Provide year-round heartworm prevention.
"
"To drain fluid from your dog’s lungs, a needle or catheter will be placed between their ribs. Your veterinarian will use a syringe to draw out the fluid, and in some cases, your dog may need a drain left in their chest for continued fluid drainage.
"
"The survival rate of pulmonary edema varies greatly because the prognosis depends on the underlying condition.
"
"For noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, the prognosis ranges from good to poor, but the prognosis tends to be better for dogs who don’t require mechanical ventilation to breathe. The prognosis for cardiogenic pulmonary edema is uncertain, because affected dogs will require lifelong treatment for their heart condition.

"Ureteral stents have also been used experimentally in dogs. These are hollow, plastic tubes that are surgically placed between the kidney and the bladder, functioning to hold the ureter open to allow normal drainage of urine.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you every two to four weeks after the obstruction has been successfully removed in order to monitor your dog's progress. Bloodwork will be taken at these appointments to be sure that the blood urea nitrogen and blood creatinine levels have fallen to normal levels. If you notice that your dog is urinating excessively and/or losing weight after the obstruction has been removed, contact your veterinarian for a further examination.

"It’s crucial for your dog to be on flea and tick prevention to help minimize the risk of disease. However, there are important guidelines to prevent toxicity when giving these medications to your pup. Substances that are toxic to fleas and ticks can also be harmful to pets when consumed or applied in large quantities.
"
"Active ingredients found in common flea and tick medications include naturally derived pyrethrins, synthetic pyrethroids, or a newer class of drugs, isoxazolines, which were the first oral flea and tick products.
"
"While they are all highly effective, they can cause toxicity if given incorrectly or if an overdose occurs.  
"
"These preventions are generally safe to use if the appropriate dose is administered. Dogs can also become exposed at toxic quantities through the ingestion or absorption of household insect sprays, foggers, and granules. 
"
"Common brands of pyrethrins/pyrethroids include:
"
"Isoxazoline-containing preventives include:
"
"Keep in mind there are many more generic and brand-name preventives that include these ingredients.
"
"Toxicity associated with flea and tick preventatives can cause a variety of symptoms that can develop within 15 minutes to several hours after ingestion or application to your dog’s skin.
"
"These symptoms include:
"
"Scratching/intense itchiness
"
"Restlessness
"
"Rolling around on the back or trying to bite the back
"
"Vocalization, crying, whimpering
"
"Redness, hair loss and future scarring and site of application
"
"Drooling
"
"Vomiting
"
"Lack of appetite
"
"Gagging or hacking
"
"Agitation
"
"Muscle tremors
"
"Difficulty standing or walking
"
"Weakness
"
"Seizures
"
"Death
"
"If you think your dog is having toxic side effects from the ingestion or absorption of pyrethrins, pyrethroids, or isoxazolines, call your veterinarian, ASPCA Poison Control, or the Pet Poison Helpline immediately for potentially life-saving treatment advice.
"
"Depending on the severity of clinical signs, seek emergency vet care immediately.
"
"Dogs often become poisoned unintentionally either through the misuse of flea and tick prevention or through the accidental ingestion or absorption of insecticides. 
"
"Prior to medicating your dog, verify the correct drug, dose and size of the product and that the proper time frame in between doses has occurred nor that someone else in the family already gave it.   
"
"Additionally, don’t give expired medications or cut larger sizes into smaller pieces or give multiple smaller doses. 
"
"If the product is labeled for cats, do not give it to your dog—or vice versa.
"
"Not all products may result in toxic symptoms as products contain varying concentrations of drug but be sure to consult your veterinarian immediately if noted.
"
"After a complete physical examination, your veterinarian will make a presumptive diagnosis if there is a known or possible history of exposure to a product containing a pyrethrin or pyrethroid, or ingestion of flea/tick medicine.
"
"In a presumptive diagnosis, a veterinarian has a good reason to believe that something is causing the problem but can't prove it with a specific diagnostic test.
"
"Blood work and urine testing may help rule out other possible causes.
"
"Depending on the severity of the toxicity and the symptoms your dog is displaying, treatment could be on an outpatient basis, or your dog might need to be hospitalized for supportive care.
"
"There is no antidote for these types of poisoning.
"
"Treatment includes quick removal of the product by bathing your dog with a liquid dish soap like Dawn®, Joy®, or Palmolive® to get the greasy substance off and rinsing the mouth with copious amounts of water.
"
"Use a garden hose, if necessary, to help flush from the mouth any toxins ingested.
"
"In cases where neurologic signs occur, it’s helpful to minimize the extent and severity of them by having your dog hospitalized, which could require several days.
"
"Supportive care might consist of:
"
"Repeat bathing
"
"Intravenous (IV) fluids
"
"Anti-nausea medications
"
"Muscle relaxation
"
"Seizure medication
"
"Your veterinarian might also want to monitor your dog’s temperature, blood sugar levels, and kidney function, since these can be affected by toxicity in dogs.
"
"With prompt recognition and early treatment, the prognosis is good.
"
"If your dog develops neurologic signs, kidney issues, seizures, and elevated body temperature, the prognosis is generally poor.
"
"Adverse reactions such as excessive drooling, paw flicking/scratching, and ear twitching are often mild and can go away on their own.
"
"Although drooling may recur for several days after use of a flea-control product, most mild to severe symptoms resolve within a few days.
"
"To prevent accidental exposure, follow all directions on flea and tick preventives and insecticides very carefully. Ensure that your dog only receives his prescribed medication as flea and tick preventatives are dosed on body weight.
"
"Also, make sure that you do not give more than one drug at a time, as that can cause an accidental overdose and can possibly interact with other medications. Speak to your veterinarian about the risk of drug interactions.  
"
"Do not use part of a larger-sized dose or multiple smaller doses, as this may result in an overdose and increased chance of poisoning. When in doubt, bring your dog to the veterinarian for proper dose.

"Heterobilharzia americana is a flatworm (or fluke) parasite that swims or wades in freshwater, including ponds, lakes, swamps, canals, etc.). 
"
"This parasite is more common in southern states such as Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. However, cases have been found as far north as Kansas. 
"
"The parasite uses a type of freshwater snail as its intermediate host, meaning that it first develops in the snail before it infects other animals. As a result, infections are limited to where these snails thrive. When the flatworm reaches a certain stage, it’s shed from the snail into the water, where it swims around looking for a host such as a dog (or other mammal) to infect.
"
"Flatworms infect a dog by penetrating the skin and migrating to the lungs, where they can cause symptoms such as coughing. From the lungs, they travel through the bloodstream to the liver, where the flatworms develop into mature adults.
"
"Within the liver, male and female flatworms reproduce, and the eggs can pierce the intestinal wall, to be shed into an animal’s feces. The lifecycle repeats if the eggs hatch in water and find another freshwater snail to infect.
"
"The symptoms caused by the flatworm in dogs are general and often mistaken for other diseases. When the flatworm penetrates the dog’s skin, they can cause a rash-type of reaction. You may notice this if your dog has short hair or if the parasite penetrates the skin on the stomach, where there is little or no hair. If you’re swimming or wading with your dog, you might also develop a rash, known as swimmer’s itch. 
"
"Other symptoms will develop as the flatworm migrates to other areas. If the flatworm migrates to the lungs, symptoms may include:
"
"Cough
"
"Loss of appetite
"
"Lethargy
"
"Eggs produced by adult flatworms will invade the intestinal tract and cause diarrhea (which may be bloody or contain mucous) as well as fever and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include:
"
"Drooling
"
"Dehydration
"
"Increased need to drink
"
"Collapse in some cases
"
"
If not treated, Heterobilharzia americana can be fatal. The severity of symptoms depends on how many mature flatworms have infected a dog, where worms have penetrated, and where inflammation is occurring. Some studies have found this process may take as long as 84 days.
"
"Flatworm infection in dogs is caused by the parasite Heterobilharzia americana. This is a flatworm parasite that uses freshwater snails as its intermediate host until it can infect a warm-blooded mammal.  
"
"A dog cannot be infected by swallowing the eggs from an infected dog’s stool. Flatworms rely on the intermediate host (the snail) for the eggs to develop further. The eggs themselves are not harmful to dogs. Humans cannot become infected by coming into contact with an infected dog’s stool.
 
"
"Unfortunately, flatworm infection often goes undiagnosed because the symptoms mimic other diseases, which is why chronic symptoms often lead to death or euthanasia due to a poor quality of life.
"
"When your veterinarian suspects flatworm infection, they will use a direct saline preparation and your dog’s fresh stool to confirm the diagnosis. This is because flatworm eggs don’t float (as most other parasites would), which is why it is not readily found on routine stool checks.
"
"An abdominal ultrasound may be done to identify changes in the liver, spleen, abdominal lymph nodes, and walls of the intestines. These changes may not lead to a direct diagnosis but can help identify the extent of damage.
"
"Clinical tests, such as an ELISA and PCR assay, have been developed to specifically diagnose flatworm infections. The choice of the veterinarian to run either of these tests is often based upon the history you communicate to your vet. This would include clinical signs and recent exposure to freshwater in a region where flatworms live.
 
"
"Your veterinarian will administer high doses of deworming medication to rid a dog of the parasite. Medication such as praziquantel or fenbendazole may be effective if the infection is caught in time. Your dog will probably be hospitalized during treatment.
"
"If diagnosed in time, a dog may be successfully treated. However, many cases lead to irreversible damage and euthanasia is recommended to spare a dog suffering. 
 
"
"If infection is diagnosed early and treatment is successful, dogs can recover quickly with no longstanding negative effects. If infection is caught later, but treatment is still successful, a dog’s life can be saved, but chronic gastrointestinal issues, among others, may be permanent.
"
"Early identification is the key to successful treatment. Make sure to give your veterinarian a very thorough history and include the area and whether your dog was exposed to freshwater.
 
"
"Yes, if not identified early in the course of the disease, infection is often fatal.
"
"Yes, flatworms are dangerous to dogs. They can cause severe debilitating disease that often leads to death if not treated properly.
"
"No, humans cannot directly become infected by flatworms from their dogs.
"
"Dogs get flatworms by swimming in freshwater sources where infected freshwater snails are living.

"Pulmonary fibrosis is one form of pneumonia that can affect dogs. The development of this disease results in inflammation and scarring of the tiny air sacs of the lungs and lung tissue. The reactive scarring of the lungs results in fibrotic tissue buildup, where the tissue becomes excessively thick, reducing the ability of the affected sacs to pass oxygen into the blood stream. Therefore, as the disease progresses, less oxygen than normal is passed into the body’s tissues when the dog breathes.
"
"The factors which initiate pulmonary fibrosis are still unknown; however, hereditary factors and a variety of micro-injuries to the air sacs are suspected. Recent evidence also suggests abnormal wound healing in the lung as a mechanism for fibrosis. It may exist concurrently with bronchitis in dogs. Affected dogs are usually midde-aged or elderly.
"
"The signs and symptoms displayed by the dog generally progress slowly; these include:
"
"West Highland White terriers and other terriers, such as the Staffordshire, Cairn, Border, and Norfolk, are genetically predisposed to pulmonary fibrosis. However, the underlying cause for this type of pneumonia is usually idiopathic. Other causes include:
"
"The biggest problem in diagnosing and treating pulmonary fibrosis is that the disease may be far along before symptoms begin to appear.
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct a full physical examination, including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, and chest X-rays. Other diagnostic tools include an echocardiography to determine whether the heart is enlarged, a computed tomography (CT) scan to view the dog's lungs three dimensionally, and biopsy samples of the affected tissues for microscopic examination.
"
"
"
"Your dog may need supplemental oxygen; in which case, it will be hospitalized. This is a life-threatening disease and may be terminal if not treated immediately and appropriately. For that reason, treatment will focus on support, and on controlling the symptoms to enhance the quality of life.
"
"If the dog is obese, there may be further treatment complications because it can impede ventilation (breathing). Weight loss will lessen symptoms of respiratory impairment.
"
"A fibrosarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in the connective tissue within the body. Connective tissue lines the entire body and helps to support and provide structure to all the muscles, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, nerves, bones, vessels, and fat. Fibrosarcoma tumors occur most often in the connective tissue beneath the skin.
"
"Fibrosarcomas can also develop in the nose, mouth, and bones. If present in the limbs or mouth, they can invade the underlying bone, potentially leading to fractures. 
"
"Fibrosarcomas are a type of soft tissue sarcoma. They often grow slowly but can exhibit local aggressiveness by invading surrounding tissues. Only about 10% of fibrosarcomas will metastasize, meaning they will spread to other locations in the body such as the lymph nodes and lungs.
"
"Fibrosarcomas are common in dogs, and large-breed dogs have a higher incidence of this type of cancer. Certain breeds, such as Irish Wolfhounds, Gordon Setters, Golden Retrievers, Brittany Spaniels, and Doberman Pinschers, may have a predisposition to develop fibrosarcomas.
"
"The clinical signs of fibrosarcomas depend on their location. Skin fibrosarcomas may manifest as a firm lump on the trunk of the body, while tumors in the mouth, nose, or bones may lead to drainage and pain in those areas. Dogs with fibrosarcomas commonly exhibit one or more of the following signs:
"
"The underlying causes of fibrosarcomas, like many other cancers, are not well understood. Cancer is generally believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Chronic stimulation from implants, like bone plates from past surgeries, or foreign bodies can contribute to cancer development. Certain carcinogens, such as radiation exposure, are known to increase the risk of cancer. Genetics and hereditary factors play a significant role. In dogs, fibrosarcomas are more prevalent in large breeds and are more commonly diagnosed in older dogs, with the average age of 10 years.
"
"Cancer refers to the unchecked division of cells. Normally, cell division occurs under the body’s guidance for specific purposes. In the case of cancer in dogs, cells divide independently, disregarding the normal regulatory mechanisms. Older animals are more susceptible to incorrect cell division, potentially having a higher number of mutated cells or a reduced efficiency in eliminating problematic cells.
"
"If your dog develops a new lump, it is important to have it examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible. It is not possible to determine whether a mass is cancerous or not by just looking at it. The best way to determine the precise cause of a lump is to examine the cells under a microscope.
"
"The two most common tests to determine the cause of a lump are cytology and histopathology (biopsy). In cytology, your veterinarian will perform a fine needle aspirate (FNA). During this procedure, a needle is inserted into the lump to collect cells, which are then sprayed onto a slide and examined under a microscope.
"
"In addition to determining the type of cell present in a lump, examination also provides a grade for fibrosarcoma. Tumors are often graded and staged, with grading referring to the “what” and staging referring to the “where.” Grading involves determining the type of tumor and its likely behavior.
"
"Your veterinarian may prescribe anti-inflammatory dosages of prednisone at first, tapering the dosage over the course of a month if there is no underlying infection. There are also some antifibrotic agents that may be helpful, as well as bronchodilators (drugs made to widen the air passages and relax the bronchial tissues) to assist your dog’s breathing.   
"
"You will need to eliminate the dog's exposure to dust or fumes. This is a progressive condition with a guarded prognosis; dogs with pulmonary fibrosis generally only survive between 8 and 15 months for dogs.
"
"Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure often develops with any severe, chronic lung disease. Your veterinarian may want to repeat lung biopsies in order to track progress the dog's progress and the effectiveness of its treatment. A positive response to treatment will result in an increase in mobility.

"Fibrosarcomas can be categorized as Grade 1, 2, or 3, with Grade 1 tumors being the least aggressive and Grade 3 tumors being the most aggressive. More aggressive tumors require more intensive treatment. Once a fibrosarcoma is diagnosed and graded, additional tests are recommended for staging. Staging involves assessing the extent of the tumor’s progression and identifying the sites where the cancer has spread. Your veterinarian may recommend blood work, X-rays, an abdominal ultrasound, and possibly a CT scan to look for evidence that the cancer has spread. The lungs and lymph nodes are the most common sites of metastasis for fibrosarcomas.
"
"The primary treatment of fibrosarcomas in dogs is typically surgery. Aggressive surgical intervention is often necessary to ensure complete removal of the cancer; however, it may not always be feasible to remove it all. For instance, a fibrosarcoma on a limb may require amputation of the entire leg to remove all the cancer cells. In cases where the tumor occurs in the nose, mouth, or body wall, complete tumor removal can be challenging or unviable.
"
"If surgery is performed, the excised mass is sent for histopathology of not only the grade but also the margins. The term “margins” refers to whether the surgery removed all of the cancer. Ideally, normal tissue surrounding the mass is removed to ensure that no cancer cells have infiltrated the surrounding tissue, minimizing the risk that the cancer can recur.
"
"Sometimes surgery is not an option, such as when the tumor is excessively large and it would be impossible to close the skin if it was removed. This is more often the case when fibrosarcomas occur in locations such as the mouth. In these cases, radiation therapy may be recommended. Radiation can also be administered prior to surgery to shrink the tumor size. A pup’s age and other underlying health conditions are also reasons why surgery may not be recommended.
"
"Additionally, oral medications may be prescribed to alleviate pain, reduce swelling, or treat secondary infections, especially if the mass is ulcerated. While fibrosarcomas generally have a limited response to chemotherapy drugs, there are instances where pain medications may be recommended as an alternative when surgery isn’t feasible. Common medications include:
"
"After surgery, it is important to keep your dog’s activity level restricted to avoid excessive stress on the incision. Usually, the post-op recovery time is two weeks. A recovery cone will likely be sent home to prevent your dog from licking or chewing the incision or rubbing the surgery site. Be sure to keep the incision clean and dry and let your veterinarian know if there is any unusual drainage or if your dog becomes lethargic or will not eat.
"
"If surgery is not possible, the management approach focuses more on keeping your dog comfortable. This may involve the administration of pain medications or antibiotics if secondary infections develop. Probiotics may also be beneficial for maintaining a balanced intestinal flora in dogs receiving pain meds or antibiotics, whether it is during the post-operative period or for supportive care.
"
"The prognosis for fibrosarcoma can vary dramatically, depending on factors such as the tumor’s location, its aggressiveness, and the extent of spread at the time of diagnosis. Although fibrosarcomas tend to invade nearby tissue, they are less prone to metastasize compared to many other malignant cancers. This characteristic can result in longer survival times and a more favorable prognosis with appropriate treatment.
"
"Survival times vary depending on where the fibrosarcoma is located, how aggressive that particular tumor is, and how far it has spread when it is diagnosed. A dog can live two to four more years with lower-grade tumors with complete excision, compared to less than a year with higher-grade tumors and incomplete excision.
"
"Fibrosarcomas can be curable in dogs in cases where they are low-grade and completely removed. While a complete cure is less common with this cancer type, it is a possibility.
"
"Fibrosarcomas in dogs are generally slow-growing. However, they are highly invasive and tend to infiltrate nearby tissues.

"Just like people, dogs have discs between their vertebrae that act as a cushion and allow for the back to be flexible. These discs are called intervertebral discs. The center of each disc is made of fibrocartilage, which is a dense connective tissue. Sometimes, although rare, a piece of fibrocartilage from within a disc can migrate into the bloodstream and lodge within a spinal artery, preventing blood flow to a section of the spinal cord. This is called a fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE), also referred to as a spinal stroke. 
"
"Fibrocartilaginous embolism or FCE in dogs occurs suddenly either when a dog is playing, or simply walking. A dog with FCE will cry out in pain briefly and then show neurologic signs, which may include acute weakness, incoordination when walking, and paralysis.
"
"While the pain usually subsides within minutes, the neurologic symptoms may or may not resolve. An FCE can occur anywhere along the spine and affect one or both sides of the body. If the FCE is in the cervical (neck) area, then all four legs may be affected, making the dog have severe difficulty moving around or lose the ability to walk. If the FCE is in the lumbar (back) region, then only one or both hind limbs will be affected.
"
"FCE is a rare condition and is considered an emergency due to the immediate onset and severity of symptoms.
"
"As mentioned, a dog that experiences FCE is often walking or playing normally and then suddenly cries out and has symptoms of FCE. Symptoms may include:
"
"Vocalization due to acute pain that subsides quickly (usually within minutes)
"
"Collapse
"
"Steatitis is characterized by inflammation of the fatty tissue. Nutrition is often involved in the pathology of this condition. Ingestion of large amounts of dietary unsaturated fats without sufficient antioxidant activity may result in peroxidation (where free radicals ""steal"" electrons from the lipids in cell membranes, resulting in cell damage) with subsequent fat necrosis (death of fat cells) and steatitis.
"
"Steatitis in dogs can also occur secondary to infection, inflammatory disorders, vasculopathy (disease of the blood vessels), cancer, injury, and immune-mediated disease. Some cases are idiopathic (cause is unknown). This is an uncommon disorder in dogs, and has become less prevalent with the addition of antioxidants to standard commercial pet food. It is most often reported in dogs with concurrent diseases, such as liver or pancreatic cancer. It is also more likely to be found in older dogs. Steatitis can be found in any part of the body as a lump under the skin. It may be mistaken as a tumor, making it important to have the lump examined and biopsied as soon as possible.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to what underlying conditions are causing the outward symptoms.
"
"To determine the exact cause of your dog's symptoms, your veterinarian will start with a physical examination of the affected area. A full physical workup will include a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. To determine the full makeup of the inflamed mass of tissue, your veterinarian will also need to do a fine-needle aspiration, taking a sample of the tissue and fluid in order to conduct a cell examination and a fungal/bacterial culture.
"
"
"
"This is a painful condition, so attention will be given to your dog's comfort level and steps will be taken to encourage the appetite. Concurrent disorders will also be treated.
"
" 
"
"Dietary changes are typically recommended. Removing all fish products from the diet and focusing on a nutritionally complete, balanced, commercially-prepared food diet is one of the first steps. Your dog may require tube feeding for a while until its condition has sufficiently improved. Your doctor may also prescribe Vitamin E and possibly corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Surgical treatment may involve draining the lump, or full removal of the lump. Antibiotics will be prescribed if the lump is found to be infected, or to prevent infection after treatment.
"
"To avoid further complications that can result from licking and biting at a healing wound, your veterinarian may advise you to keep an Elizabethan collar on your dog until the wound has fully healed.
"
"Feed a commercial diet that is balanced to meet all of your dog's dietary needs.
"
"It may require weeks to months for resolution of this condition, but the prognosis is good once the primary cause of the steatitis has been treated and an appropriate diet is established.

"Weakness (paresis) of one or more limbs
"
"Lameness
"
"Knuckling of one or more paws

"

"
"A FCE forms when a piece of fibrocartilage from within one of the intervertebral discs suddenly loosens and migrates into the bloodstream, where it gets lodged within a spinal artery. It is unknown what causes the fibrocartilage to migrate or how it finds its way into the bloodstream. 
"
"All breeds of dogs are at risk for FCE, but large- and giant-breed dogs, such as the Labrador Retriever and Bernese Mountain Dog, are more predisposed. In contrast, the Miniature Schnauzer, Yorkshire Terrier, and Shetland Sheepdog have also been found to have a higher incidence of FCE even though they are small-breed dogs.
"
"Most dogs that experience a FCE are middle-aged, usually 3 to 6 years old. A FCE is more common in dogs that play a high-intensity sport, like Frisbee®, or suffer from a traumatic injury. However, a dog who is merely walking can also develop an FCE.
"
"A veterinarian will first perform a thorough physical exam. This will be followed by a neurological exam which will include assessing the dog’s gait and checking for a pain response, as well as testing the dog’s reflexes. Based on the neurological exam findings, the veterinarian can determine which section of the spine is affected.
"
"The following diagnostic tests may be recommended to diagnose an FCE:
"
"X-rays of the spine are often normal because the fibrocartilage that is forming the embolism is not visible on an X-ray. 
"
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard to diagnose FCE. However, only a few veterinary hospitals have an MRI machine, so it may be difficult to find a location that can perform this test. An MRI takes multiple images of the spinal cord while the dog is under general anesthesia.
"
"Myelography is a contrast study that involves injecting a dye into the spinal canal and then taking X-rays of the spine. The dye should outline the spinal cord. If there is an FCE, some localized swelling of the spinal cord may be visible on the X-rays. Also, the dye may be absent in an area due to swelling caused by the FCE. This diagnostic test, however, does not give a definitive diagnosis of an FCE but can support that one may be present.
"
"Spinal fluid analysis may be recommended to rule out an infection within the spinal fluid. Most often the fluid is normal in dogs that have an FCE, but occasionally some inflammatory cells and extra protein may be present in the fluid where no infection is found.
"
"There is no specific treatment for a FCE, which means that no medications or surgery is required. Physical therapy and supportive care are the best ways to help a dog with FCE.
"
"If the dog has lost its ability to urinate due to the FCE, then a veterinary professional must express the dog’s bladder as needed to prevent rupture and teach the pet parent how to do so as well. If the dog regains the ability to stand, it is best to use a harness and sling to support them and encourage them to walk, as this can improve recovery.
"
"If the dog can be referred to a veterinarian, who specializes in physical therapy, this can also help the dog regain function and confidence in walking again. The physical therapist can massage the area where the FCE is located, stimulate the muscles through neuromuscular electrostimulation, and provide hydrotherapy using an underwater treadmill to promote use of the limbs.
"
"Recovery from a FCE takes time. Most dogs with a FCE will start to show signs of improvement within 14 days, but recovery can continue up to 3 to 4 months after the onset of the FCE in some cases. The amount of recovery depends on the degree of the neurologic deficits. For instance, a dog that is paralyzed in one or more limbs has a more severe condition than a dog that is knuckling on one or more paws but still has feeling in its limbs. Repeated neurological exams will be needed to check reflexes and assess for pain response. A dog that does not suffer paralysis has a better prognosis. 
"
"With FCE in dogs, the amount of recovery will vary. Some dogs make a full recovery, while others are not as fortunate. Nerve deficits may persist and the dog may never walk normally again due to the affected limb(s). It may also show signs of fecal incontinence, and/or need the bladder expressed several times a day for life. Euthanasia should be considered if the dog’s quality of life is poor, and no improvement is seen after 14 days of when the FCE occurred. If a dog has an FCE, it is unlikely that the dog will suffer from another FCE in the future.

"Kidneys function to filter the blood. They remove waste products and control the flow of nutrients and fluids. Within the kidney, tiny tubules perform these tasks. Dogs have hundreds of thousands of them that keep glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes such as potassium and chloride in balance. Glucose and amino acids provide the energy needed to allow puppies to grow and keep dogs healthy. Electrolytes help control hydration, many metabolic processes, and keep the pH (acid-base status) of body tissues normal.
"
" In dogs with Fanconi syndrome, these renal tubules are “leaky” and too much glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes are passed from the bloodstream into the urine. The leaking nutrients cause weight loss, muscle loss, and fatigue. Unbalanced electrolytes result in dehydration, weakness, and dangerous changes in the normal acid-base balance in the blood, known as pH.
"
"Fanconi syndrome is a chronic but usually manageable disease. If the disease is undiagnosed, untreated, or progresses into renal failure, it can be fatal. Any severe clinical signs or worsening of symptoms should be considered a medical emergency.
"
"Excessive urination
"
"Extreme thirst/drinking
"
"Weight loss
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Poor body condition
"
"Poor growth rates in young dogs
"
"Weakness or extreme tiredness
"
"Fanconi syndrome in dogs can be genetic. About 75 percent of dogs with Fanconi syndrome are Basenjis; it’s recommended to have genetic testing for this breed.
"
"Fanconi syndrome can also be caused by:
"
"Eating toxins (such as melamine, lead, copper, or salicylic acid)  
"
"Uncommon reactions or high doses of some medications
"
"Concurrent diseases, such as hypoparathyroidism or low vitamin D
"
"Veterinarians will start with a full physical exam and may recommend the following testing:
"
"Complete blood count
"
"Chemistry panel
"
"Blood gases
"
"Urinalysis
"
"Urine sample testing for the concentration of amino acids in urine
"
"Fanconi syndrome does not have a cure, but it can be managed with a dietary supplement such as mineral or amino acid supplements. Depending on lab work, special diets to adjust the amount of protein in the food may be needed.  It’s critical that dogs with Fanconi syndrome always have access to fresh water and that their health is closely monitored.
"
"If Fanconi syndrome is severe or progresses into renal failure, your dog many need to be hospitalized for IV fluid and electrolyte therapy.
"
"The life expectancy of dogs with Fanconi syndrome varies. Some dogs can be managed well for years, but others do not respond and can progress quickly into renal failure.
"
"Dogs with Fanconi syndrome will benefit the most from careful monitoring by their families and their veterinarians. Dogs should always have fresh water available and be encouraged to drink frequently.
"
"Any new symptoms, such as weakness, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, refusal to eat, or changes in urination need to be evaluated by your veterinarian.
"
"This is a term used to explain dogs when they show the symptoms and test results of a dog with Fanconi syndrome but are not genetically predisposed to the disease. These dogs are usually identified as having been exposed to some sort of toxin.
"
"In some cases, Fanconi-like syndrome was reported in dogs eating jerky treats made outside the United States. In the majority of these cases, the symptoms resolved once the toxin was removed from their diet, though the possibility of severe lasting kidney damage may still exist.
"
"The life expectancy of dogs with Fanconi syndrome can vary; some dogs can be managed for years, but others can progress quickly into renal failure.
"
"Fanconi syndrome cannot be cured.  It can be managed in most dogs, but the response to therapy is variable.

"The term “panniculitis” refers to an inflammation of the subcutaneous fat tissue. That is, the layer of fat just under the dog's skin becomes inflamed. Though uncommon, the fatty tissue typically concentrates and affects the trunk area as a single nodule or as multiple nodules. In addition, as a result of secondary infections and other complications, the fat cells within the nodule(s) may die.
"
"Dogs of any age, sex, or breed may be affected by panniculitis. However, dachshunds, collies, and miniature poodles are more at risk.
"
"Most dogs have a single nodular lesion on the trunk that vary from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The nodule, which is either firm or soft, is freely movable underneath the skin until fully grown. In some cases, yellow-brown to bloody discharge is excreted from the nodule, while the outer skin may turn red, brown, or yellow in color. The area may be extremely sensitive, especially immediately after rupturing. After the ulcers heal, a scar or crusty layer of skin may form.
"
"Dogs with multiple lesions may also demonstrate systemic signs such as loss of appetite (anorexia), lethargy, and depression.
"
"Panniculitis may be caused by several factors, including:
"
"You will need to give the veterinarian a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile. However, other than the presence of a mass or nodule beneath the skin, most dogs will not demonstrate other complications.
"
"Depending on the underlying cause, other diagnostic procedures may be used to rule our other diseases/conditions. For example, the number of white blood cells on a CBC (complete blood count) typically rises in case of infection and help veterinarian determine the type, duration, and severity of infection. Your veterinarian will also usually take a sample directly from the nodule and send it to a pathologist for culture and sensitivity, which helps in determining the type of causative organism (bacteria, fungi) and the suitable course of treatment.
"
"
"
"Often, the preferred method of treatment is surgery, especially if only a single nodule is present. However, in case of multiple nodules, a combination of surgery and medication works well. For example, if fungal or bacterial infections are involved, antifungal and  antibacterial medications will be administered, respectively.
"
"If no organism has found to be the cause of the panniculitis -- also called a sterile nodule -- your veterinarian will prescribe steroids, to aid in the regression of the nodule. Vitamin E can also be given in mild cases.
"
"Overall prognosis for dogs with panniculitis is often good after treatment. In some cases, it takes just three to six weeks for the nodule(s) to completely regress. Your veterinarian will ask that you bring in the dog for regular follow-up exams, where he or she will conduct routine laboratory tests to monitor the progress of the treatment. This is especially true if steroids are being used to regress the nodule(s).

"This familial immunoreactive disorder is found only in Chinese Shar-Pei dogs, characterized by episodic fever and swollen hocks (back of the leg). If left untreated, it can lead to excessive amyloid accumulation throughout the body and subsequent kidney and liver failure. 
"
"Any chronic infection, inflammation, immune-mediated disease, or cancer can cause reactive or secondary amyloidosis. However, dysregulation of immune and inflammatory processes are also thought to predispose shar-pei dogs to this disorder.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC).
"
"Other tests which can be done to rule out or identify the underlying disease causing the amyloidosis include Ehrlichia and Borrelia serology, Heartworm exams, Coombs' test, rheumatoid arthritis factor tests, and a clotting profile, which can help rule out liver disease. Chest X-rays and abdominal X-rays and ultrasounds are used by the veterinarian to look for liver and kidney abnormalities, and an analysis of synovial fluid may show acute inflammation.
"
"X-rays of the joints will show a swelling of the soft tissues around the joint with no bony involvement. An abdominal ultrasound is useful to examine the consistency of the liver and kidneys.
"
"Lastly, if amyloid is being deposited in the kidneys the urine protein:creatinine ratio can increase from less than one (normal) to greater than thirteen.
"
"
"
"The course of treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the disorder. If the dog is undergoing pain and fever responsive to NSAIDS, for example, it may be treated on an outpatient basis. Conversely, Shar-Pei dogs showing anorexia, fever, marked lameness or nonspecific pain, vomiting or diarrhea, fluid in the abdomen, or episodes of cholestasis (bile flow blockage in the liver) should be treated on an inpatient basis. And those undergoing organ failure or suffering from a blood clot or portal and renal vein thrombosis should be placed in intensive care immediately.
"
"Antibiotics, fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, and blood transfusions are also provided on a case-by-case basis. For DIC or other coagulopathies fresh frozen plasma can be given. And severely hypoalbuminec patients with ascites may receive human serum albumin transfusions.
"
"Unfortunately, there is no cure for familial shar-pei amyloidosis. Therapy may decrease the deposition of amyloid, but often the condition has progressed beyond the stage at which medication is beneficial. In addition, because of the genetic nature of the disorder, your veterinarian will recommend against breeding the affected Shar-Pei.

"Cyclic hematopoiesis (formation of blood cells) in color-dilute gray collie pups is characterized by frequent episodes of infection with failure to thrive and early death. Clinically, the pups may appear normal for the first 4–6 weeks and then develop diarrhea, conjunctivitis, gingivitis, pneumonia, skin infections, carpal joint pain, and fever. A frequent cause of death of the pups is intussusception (blockage) of the small intestine.
"
"Episodes of illness, varying from inactivity accompanied by fever, to life-threatening infection, repeat at 11- to 14-day intervals. The gray pups are usually smaller than their litter mates at birth, weak, and often pushed aside by the bitch.
"
"Cyclic hematopoiesis has been observed in many collie bloodlines in the U.S. and in other countries; however, experienced collie breeders do not attempt to raise the affected pups and frequently will not acknowledge the presence of the responsible gene in their bloodline. As a result, gray collie pups are not commonly observed.
"
"Cyclic hematopoiesis in the collie breed is present only in the color-dilute pups. The color dilution and bone marrow disorder are inherited as an autosomal recessive trait (presumably the same gene). The bone marrow disorder and color dilution was present in pups resulting from a collie/beagle cross and could occur in any mongrel with collie bloodlines in both parents, if both parents had the recessive gene. Clinical signs occur as early as 1–2 weeks of age and are always apparent by 4–6 weeks of age.
"
"An apparently similar disease was reported in normal-colored pups in two Border collie litters in the UK. Single cases of cyclic hematopoiesis have been reported in Pomeranians and cocker spaniels; the disease is not well characterized in these breeds.
"
"This cellular disease is inherited genetically.
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your puppy's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Any details that you can provide about the pregnancy, birth, and infancy stages will be helpful for your veterinarian in determining the appropriate course of action. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on the puppy, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis.
"
"If the complete blood count shows an abnormally low number of neutrophils at two week intervals, and the collie shows expression of genes for a dilute coat color along with a nasal epithelial color dilution, this is strong support for a diagnosis of cyclic hematopoiesis.
"
"
"
"Supportive therapy will include fluid therapy and antibiotics. These treatments may extend the life of the affected collie pups for several years, but keep in mind that such treatment is often cost prohibitive.
"
"Experimental treatments have succeeded in interrupting the disease cycle by transplanting bone marrow, and with daily treatment of endotoxin, lithium, or recombinant human or canine colony-stimulating factor.
"
"Unfortunately, keeping puppies that have been diagnosed with cyclic hematopoiesis alive requires a substantial financial cost. Your veterinarian will be able to inform you of the latest experimental treatments for this disease. For most owners, euthanasia is the most practical solution because of the prohibitive costs involved. If you have a color dilute collie, or a collie which you know carries color dilution genes (due to previous litters), do not breed your pet further, as this disease is inherited and will be passed along blood lines. This precaution applies for both male and female collies.

"Cobalamin malabsorption refers to a genetic abnormality by which the vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, fails to be absorbed from the intestine. This condition occurs secondary to the absence of a specific binding receptor in the lower intestine (the ileum) for intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex (IF-cbl). This is a rare disease that tends to affect Giant Schnauzers, Border Collies, and Beagles. In the Giant Schnauzer, it is inherited as a simple autosomal recessive trait. Symptoms generally appear at 6 to 12 weeks of age in Giant Schnauzers, and around four to six months in Border Collies.
"
"The cause of this disease is genetic inheritance.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, with a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The blood serum will be examined for cobalamin concentration levels; low levels would be indicative of an absorption failure. The serum check will also give some information on any secondary conditions affecting the body by how high the levels of white blood cells are in the blood serum. Urinalysis may return higher than normal levels of white blood cells as well. You will need to provide a thorough history of your pet's health leading up to the onset of symptoms, including any genetic information you have.
"
"Your veterinarian may find chronic non-regenerative anemia, where the body does not respond to a deficiency of red blood cells, or mild to severe neutropenia, where the body is suffering from an abnormally low amount of white blood cell neutrophils.
"
"Further tests may show that the failure of cobalamin to absorb is related to other congenital metabolic diseases, or to a parasite in the gastrointestinal tract.
"
"
"
"Medical treatment can typically be on an outpatient basis, with long-term supplementary administration of cobalamin. Any other appropriate medications will be as prescribed by your veterinarian, based on the medical findings.

"False pregnancy in dogs—also called pseudopregnancy or pseudocyesis—is a condition which can occur in unspayed female dogs because of normal changes in hormone levels.
"
"Unspayed females experience estrous cycles (“heat”) as early as 6 months of age that repeat approximately every six to twelve months thereafter.
"
"Hormone levels drastically change during this time to prepare the dog to conceive puppies and maintain a pregnancy. Typically, if the dog doesn’t conceive, hormone levels decrease, and the dog’s body returns to normal.
"
"However, in dogs experiencing false pregnancy, this change in hormones tricks the body into thinking pregnancy has occurred and the dog develops corresponding symptoms.
"
"It’s unclear why this occurs in some dogs and not others.
"
"Dogs with false pregnancies experience the same symptoms as dogs who are truly pregnant, such as swollen mammary glands (breasts), low energy, and nausea.
"
"Because it can be difficult for pet parents to tell the difference between a true pregnancy and a pseudopregnancy in dogs, have your veterinarian examine your pup to make an accurate diagnosis.
"
"Phantom pregnancy in dogs causes the same behavioral and physical changes seen in pups who are pregnant.
"
"Some common symptoms of false pregnancy in dogs include:
"
"Restlessness
"
"Nesting behaviors, such as moving blankets to form a bed
"
"Reactivity
"
"Lethargy
"
"Mammary gland enlargement
"
"Enlarged nipples
"
"Leaking of milk
"
"Changes in appetite
"
"Nausea or vomiting
"
"Fluid retention
"
"Weight gain
"
"False pregnancy in dogs is the result of a rapid decrease in the hormone progesterone and an increase in the hormone prolactin.
"
"These hormonal changes occur normally in an unspayed female dog for about six to eight weeks following heat.
"
"The same hormonal changes can also occur in a female dog who was spayed during a part of the heat cycle when she had high progesterone. The spay causes the same rapid progesterone to decrease as the normal heat cycle.
"
"This can result in a false pregnancy.
"
"If your dog is showing signs of a false pregnancy, bring her to the vet.
"
"If her symptoms, history, and physical exam findings all fit this condition and there’s no chance that your dog is pregnant, then a false pregnancy can be diagnosed by your vet without additional testing.
"
"If there is a possibility your dog could be pregnant, an ultrasound or X-ray may be used to see if she is carrying puppies depending on the time since possible conception.
"
"Other medical conditions can cause similar symptoms like an enlarged mammary gland or changes in appetite that may need to be differentiated by a veterinarian.
"
"If there could be other causes for your dog’s symptoms besides a false pregnancy, additional testing may include blood work, urinalysis, or biopsy of the mammary gland.
"
"Usually, false pregnancy in dogs resolves in two to three weeks without any treatment.
"
"For dogs that are irritating their nipples by licking them, a T-shirt, recovery cone, or inflatable collar may be needed.
"
"Avoid milking or touching your dog’s nipples and mammary glands, as this will encourage more milk production.
"
"To permanently treat pseudopregnancy and prevent future occurrences, talk to your vet about spaying your pup. A veterinarian can recommend the proper timing of surgery based on when the dog started her estrous cycle.
"
"If surgery is done at the wrong time during her cycle, it can prolong false pregnancy in dogs.
"
"Alternatively, medication can be given that blocks the prolactin hormone so that symptoms resolve. However, this doesn’t prevent future occurrences.
"
"Since false pregnancy in dogs is due to a hormonal change, your dog should be back to normal within a few weeks as her hormones cycle again.
"
"Female dogs who aren’t spayed and experience false pregnancies may have them during every heat cycle.
"
"To prevent false pregnancies, dogs should be spayed prior to their first heat cycle.
"
"This is generally around six months of age, but it can vary depending on the breed of dog.

"An eye ulcer, also medically termed corneal ulcer, or ulcerative keratitis in dogs, is a condition where the outer layer of the eye (the cornea) erodes, causing a divot or dent.  
"
"This divot can be superficial (on the surface), or it can affect the deeper layers of the eye. Eye ulcers lead to pain, redness of the eye, eye discharge, blinking frequently or holding the eye closed, and sometimes swelling. This is a common condition and is diagnosed most often in brachycephalic (flat-nosed) dog breeds but can easily affect any breed of dog.   
"

"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Symptoms of eye ulcers in dogs range from mild to severe depending on the cause and severity of the erosion.  
"
"Symptoms in order of severity include: 
"
"Blinking the eye more often 
"
"Excessive tearing 
"
"Redness of the eye  
"
"Swelling of the eyelid or skin around the affected eye 
"
"Pawing at the eye or rubbing their face on the ground 
"
"Elevated third eyelid (third eyelid is located in the inside corner of the eye) 
"
"Holding the eye completely shut 
"
"Yellow/green/bloody eye discharge (in severe cases) 
"
"Hole (perforation) in the outer layer of the eye/rupture of the eye (in severe cases) 
"
"Blindness in affected eye (in severe cases) 
"
"Decreased appetite 
"
"Lethargy or hiding behavior 
"
"Anything that disrupts any part of the normal outer layer of the eye (cornea) can cause an ulcer, including if it affects the normal corneal structure, function, or physiology. Causes of eye ulcers in dogs are most commonly trauma, foreign body injury, or chemical burns.   
"
"These are some of the multiple causes of ulcerative keratitis in dogs: 
"
"Trauma: scratches from another animal; running into tree branches, plants, or bushes; self-inflicted trauma from rubbing their own face 
"
"Foreign body: sand, dirt, or other foreign material can enter the eye and get stuck behind the eyelids, causing repeated damage to the cornea 
"
"Chemical irritation/burns: shampoos, topical medications, or household cleaning products getting into the eye 
"
"Bacterial infections 
"
"Viral infections 
"
"Secondary to conformation/congenital issues of the eye: such as abnormal eyelash growth (distichia), eyelid masses or tumors, or entropion (rolling in of the lower eyelid) 
"
"Secondary to chronic dry eye: called keratoconjunctivitis sicca 
"
"Secondary to neurologic issues: that do not allow the eyes to blink appropriately 
"
"Secondary to certain endocrine diseases: such as diabetes mellitus, Cushing’s disease, and hypothyroidism 
"
"Secondary to inherited conditions: such as epithelial dystrophy, seen most commonly in Boxers, King Charles Cavaliers, Beagles, Cocker Spaniels, Afghan Hounds, and Alaskan Malamutes 
"
"Your veterinarian will want to perform some eye tests to find the cause of the ulceration and to decide on a course of action for treatment. The most important part of diagnosing and treating eye ulcers in dogs is to figure out if the erosion is simple or complicated.   
"
"A simple (uncomplicated) eye ulcer only involves the most superficial (surface) layer of the cornea and usually heals within 7-10 days without progression into the deeper corneal layers.  
"
"A complicated eye ulcer extends into the deeper layers of the cornea and can become infected or even start “melting” the deeper layers because of severe inflammation (swelling) and microorganism invasion.  
"
"There are three types of complicated ulcers:  
"
"Persistent corneal ulcers: This includes superficial ulcers with an elevated outer rim making it more difficult for the cornea to heal itself. They often heal with longer courses of therapy over several weeks to months. They sometimes require surgery to correct the problem if they worsen or do not heal with the right therapy. 
"
"Corneal foreign bodies: Objects can penetrate superficially or can penetrate the deeper layers of the cornea. The deeper the foreign body goes the faster and more intense inflammation occurs. Often these foreign bodies require careful removal by a veterinarian and aggressive therapy to heal. Surgery is sometimes necessary. 
"
"Stromal ulcers: These affect the deepest layer of the cornea, which is the wall between the outer layer of the eye and the fluid contained within the front chamber of the eye. They require aggressive medical and surgical management which may include melting ulcers (descemetoceles), and cat claw lacerations (cuts) or perforations (holes) to treat. These ulcers are often infected, severely inflamed, and painful. 
"
"Your vet will perform a thorough examination of the eye itself to assess for any foreign objects, obvious lacerations or abnormal eyelashes, and masses prior to any diagnostic testing.   
"
"Sometimes obvious lacerations or divots are noted in the eye with or without inflammation around the affected ulceration. Often, superficial erosions are not visible without special equipment.   
"
"Diagnostic testing that is usually performed by your veterinarian may include: 
"
"Fluorescein stain: A drop of this special yellow to green tinged dye is placed in your dog’s eye. The dye will adhere to the ulcerated tissue unless the ulcer is deep; then usually just the affected rim around the eroded area will uptake the dye. Small eye ulcers may require certain ophthalmic filter equipment to diagnose while other larger ulcers are often obvious when illuminated after fluorescein staining. 
"
"Schirmer tear testing: This is a simple, noninvasive test to measure tear production and to diagnose chronic dry eye in dogs. This is a common cause of corneal ulceration if no other obvious foreign material or objects are found to be causing the ulcer.   
"
"Intraocular pressures (tonometry): This is a simple, noninvasive test that helps to find the pressure behind the eye. If the corneal ulcer is deep or extensive, then this test may not be performed to avoid rupture of the eye itself. Often medical issues such as glaucoma or uveitis are diagnosed as a primary or secondary issue with deep or chronic corneal ulcers. 
"
"Bacterial culture: This involves taking a sample of cells from the cornea which are then allowed to incubate and checked for growth of bacterial cells. A culture helps to direct antibiotic therapy in melting, chronic, non-healing, and deep eye ulcers. 
"
"Cytology: This involves taking a small sample of cells from the cornea to assess under a microscope. A cytology can help direct the correct therapy in chronic, non-healing, or deep eye ulcers.   
"
"Treatment of eye ulcers in dogs depends on the type of corneal ulcer and the severity of the ulcer itself. Therapy is divided into two types: medical and surgical therapies. 
"
"A therapy common for simple eye ulcers including broad-spectrum, topical antibiotics, and often topical pain medication. Sometimes systemic pain medication is added depending on the comfort level of the dog.  
"
"Contact lenses are sometimes used to protect the outer layer of the eye while uncomplicated ulcers are healing. Most of these simple ulcers heal with therapy within 3-7 days. It is important to continue watching even simple ulcers closely and follow up with your veterinarian for recommended recheck appointments to ensure that the ulcer is not getting deeper or becoming infected.   
"
"Complicated eye ulcers often require more potent topical antibiotics up to every 2-4 hours depending on the diagnosis. Oral antibiotics and pain medications are also often required for systemic therapy and comfort control. These types of ulcers are watched very closely with frequent veterinary exams to ensure that the ulcer does not worsen during therapy. These can progress to deep ulcers, which require surgical intervention.   
"
"Simple, superficial foreign objects can sometimes be easily removed from the cornea with ophthalmic irrigation (a sterile cleansing solution used to flush the eye), while deeper foreign bodies often need gentle removal under general anesthesia by a veterinarian. Remaining lacerations or ulcerations can be thoroughly treated after removal with aggressive medical therapy. 
"
"Indolent (non-healing) ulcers often require keratotomy or burr debridement, which uses a specific burring instrument (cutting tool) to remove the dead cells from the ulcer. It also stimulates blood vessels’ invasion into the ulcer for healing. Most of these ulcers heal about 2-3 weeks after this procedure.   
"
"Surgical intervention is necessary when an eye ulcer is deep, complicated, melting, or is chronic and no longer responding to medical therapy. 
"
"Conjunctival (eye tissue) grafts are the most common surgery performed. This is where conjunctival tissue is transposed over the affected ulcer and is used to provide support and blood supply during healing. In some cases, a third eyelid flap and a temporary surgical closing of the eyelids (tarsorrhaphy) are used for ulcers caused by some congenital (present at birth) or neurologic (nervous system) issues. This acts as a bandage to protect the eye during healing.   
"
"Some chronic or deeper ulcers can cause secondary inflammation in the eye, or uveitis, which requires more aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy using systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and additional systemic analgesics.  
"
"Elizabethan collars or pet cones are a necessity during healing from all eye ulcers. They eliminate the possibility of self-trauma caused by rubbing or pawing and protect your dog during healing. This collar must always remain on until it is deemed safe for removal by your veterinarian. Removing the collar too soon can lead to trauma and complicate current corneal ulcerations. 
"
"Most simple eye ulcers are rechecked by a veterinarian in 5-7 days to assess healing. Most of these ulcers heal during this time with the right therapy. Prognosis is usually excellent for full recovery.  
"
"Deeper or more complicated ulcers are checked more often, usually 1-2 days after diagnosis, to make certain that they are showing signs of improvement and not worsening. Sometimes, a pet may be hospitalized to perform frequent treatments every 2-4 hours. Medications are changed or extended based on bacterial culture and cytology results.   
"
"For melting, deep stromal, or complicated eye ulcers, referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist (eye doctor) is usually recommended for treatment and surgical intervention. Conjunctival grafts are usually left in place for 2-3 months. Complicated ulcers are monitored closely by a veterinarian for several weeks after surgery or therapy to assess for tear production, which may require medical management for short periods of time or permanently in some cases. 
"
"Any underlying medical conditions or congenital abnormalities must be diagnosed and correctly treated to avoid chronic eye ulcers or frequent development of corneal ulcers in the future. 
"
"The cornea is the clear cell membranous outer layer of the eye and is made up of three cell layers. The most outer layer is called the epithelium, the thick middle layer is the stroma, and the thinnest, innermost layer is the endothelium (otherwise known as Descemet’s membrane).
"
"Yes. Erosion of the outer layer of the eye, the corneal epithelium, is called a corneal abrasion or erosion. When this erosion gets deeper and affects the middle layer or inner layer of the eye, a corneal ulceration occurs. This usually happens from self-trauma (rubbing the face or eyes), bacterial infection, or chronic/progressive inflammation.
"
"Indolent corneal ulcers are ulcers affecting the superficial layer of the cornea that do not heal within 7 days. Often this type of ulcer will seem to be improving when therapy starts, but then it deteriorates with no obvious cause. Often, these ulcers require keratectomy (laser eye surgery) to remove the unhealthy layers and allow therapy and healing.

"Many different health problems can make a dog’s eyes red, swollen, and runny. Wounds, infections, allergies, anatomical abnormalities, and foreign material trapped on the surface of the eye are some of the most common, but did you know that a type of parasite called an eyeworm might also be to blame? Read on to learn all about eyeworms in dogs and what can be done to treat and prevent them.
"
"Eyeworms (Thelazia californiensis is the most common species) are transmitted to dogs through contact with certain kinds of flies. Research points to canyon flies (Fannia benjamini complex) as the primary vector of eyeworms in the western part of the United States, but it is possible that different flies are involved in other locations. Thelazia californiensis and other types of eyeworms have been diagnosed in most parts of the world.
"
"The eyeworm lifecycle is fairly straightforward. Adults that are living on the eyes an infected animal breed and lay their eggs. When a fly comes by to feed on the tears of the animal, it picks up the larvae that have hatched from the eggs. These larvae mature within the fly and then migrate to the fly’s mouthparts at which point they are deposited on the eyes of another animal when the fly feeds again. Eyeworms can infect dogs, cats, wildlife, livestock, and even people.
"
"Unsurprisingly, the presence of a worm living on a dog’s eye is very irritating, particularly because Thelazia have sharp serrations on their outer surface that can damage the sensitive structures of a dog’s eye. The body reacts to this with a lot of inflammation, which can lead to redness of the eye and surrounding tissues, swelling of the conjunctiva (the mucous membranes around the eye), excessive tearing, itching, and squinting. Sometimes the cornea (the clear outer surface of the eye) can become ulcerated or scarred. When dogs have only a few eyeworms, their eyes may look almost normal. Heavily infected dogs typically have more severe symptoms.
"
"The worms themselves are often visible upon close examination of a dog with eyeworms. They are white to cream in color, thin, and can range from 10 to 15 millimeters (around one-half of an inch) in length. Thelazia may be visible on the surface of the eye but can also be found under the eyelids (including the third eyelid) and within the ducts that carry tears to and from the eyes.
"
"Veterinarians can usually diagnose eyeworms based on a physical examination alone. It may be necessary to numb the dog’s eyes with a topical anesthetic or to sedate the dog to get a good look under the eyelids.
"
"The most common way to treat eyeworms in dogs is to physically remove the worms. A veterinarian will apply a topical anesthetic to the surface of the eye and/or sedate the dog. The worms can then be gently plucked away using forceps or flushed out using a sterile saline rinse. Veterinarians may also prescribe medications that will kill the parasites. Options include ivermectin, moxidectin, imidacloprid, and selamectin. A veterinarian will determine which form of treatment is best based on the situation.
"
"Dogs with severe eye inflammation caused by eyeworms may also need topical or systemic anti-inflammatory medications to bring down swelling and reduce redness and irritation. Dog antibiotics may also be prescribed to treat or prevent secondary bacterial infections.
"
"Dogs that are recovering from an eyeworm infection should be monitored closely. If the symptoms worsen at any point or fail to improve over the course of a week or so, contact your veterinarian.
"
"Keeping pets indoors during times when flies are active would prevent most cases of eyeworms in dogs. Research has shown that flies that can carry eyeworms are present year-round in Southern California, but fly activity could certainly differ in other parts of the country.
"
"If fly avoidance is not possible, the routine use of a fly repellent labeled for dogs or a medication that kills parasites (e.g., oral milbemycin) may be advisable. Speak to your veterinarian about what type of preventive measures would be safe and effective for your dog.

"Cherry eye is the common name for prolapsed gland of the third eyelid, meaning the gland has moved (prolapsed) out of its proper position. While humans only have two eyelids, dogs have three. Their third eyelid is located in the lower inner corner of the eye (close to the muzzle). This eyelid is made of conjunctiva (a thin, protective membrane), a T-shaped cartilage (firm connective tissue), and a lacrimal gland (tear gland). The tear gland is located at the bottom of the cartilage and cannot typically be seen.  
"
"In some dogs, the T-shaped cartilage flips upside-down, exposing (prolapsing) the third eyelid gland. When exposed, the gland often appears like a red or pink mass in the lower inside corner of the eye—this is where the term “cherry eye” comes from. 
"
"Certain dog breeds are more predisposed to cherry eye than others. Researchers aren’t sure exactly why, but there is likely a genetic component. It is suspected that the connective tissues that hold the gland in place are not as strong as they should be in these particular breeds. 
"
"Some of the most commonly affected breeds include:  
"
"Cocker Spaniel (American Cocker Spaniel) 
"
"Beagle 
"
"Bulldog (English Bulldog, British Bulldog) 
"
"French Bulldog  
"
"Chinese Shar-Pei 
"
"Newfoundland 
"
"Neapolitan Mastiff 
"
"Great Dane 
"
"Lhasa Apso 
"
"Cane Corso 
"
"Bloodhound 
"
"Shih Tzu 
"
"Boston Terrier 
"
"Pekingese 
"
"The hallmark sign of cherry eye is a round, red or pink mass in the lower inner corner of the eye that looks like a cherry pit. This disease can affect either one eye or both eyes.  
"
"Symptoms of cherry eye that may be noticed at home include:  
"
"Red mass in the inner corner of the eye 
"
"Discharge from the eye 
"
"Redness of the eye 
"
"Inflammation and redness of the conjunctiva 
"
"Pawing at the eye or rubbing the face on various surface (to scratch the eye), these signs indicate that the eye is uncomfortable and another issue is occurring secondary to cherry eye 
"
"It is important to note that prolapse of the third eyelid gland is not painful. However, cherry eye can lead to secondary issues, such as ulcers of the cornea (the eye’s clear, protective outer layer) and chronic dry eye (not enough tears), which can be uncomfortable.  
"
"It is still unknown what causes cherry eye in dogs. It is suspected that in certain breeds, the connective tissues that hold the third eyelid gland in place are weaker, predisposing them to cherry eye.  
"
"It also suspected that in giant breed dogs, their large orbit (eye socket) has more room and flexibility, making the eyelid more likely to prolapse.  
"
"Conversely, in small breed dogs, their orbit (eye socket) may be too small for the eye, and the lack of space for both the eye and the gland of the third eyelid may predispose them to cherry eye.  
"
"However, these are only theories as to why cherry eye occurs more frequently in certain breeds, as the true cause is still unknown.  
"
"Cherry eye in dogs is typically treated with surgery and post-surgical medication. Your veterinarian will be able to determine the best course of action based on your pet’s diagnosis. 
"
"If left untreated, cherry eye can cause secondary issues in the dogs’ eyes. For this reason, surgery is recommended to place the gland back in the proper position. Surgery, generally, also prevents the disease from recurring.  
"
"There are several surgical techniques that are effective. The specific technique used depends on the surgeon’s experience and preference.  
"
"After surgery, a dog will likely be placed on a few medications. The first is a topical eye antibiotic to prevent infections at the surgical site, as an infection could cause the surgery to fail.  
"
"The pain from the procedure typically comes from inflammation. As such, an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) will likely be given for inflammation and pain.  
"
"It is essential to keep an Elizabethan collar (e-collar) on your pet while the surgical incisions are healing. This will prevent the dog from scratching at the incisions, which could potentially cause the surgery to fail. 
"
"In general, unless complications occur, most dogs are rechecked about 2-4 weeks after surgery. At this time a Schirmer tear test will be performed to check for dry eye, as that is the most common secondary condition to occur in pets with cherry eye. The Schirmer tear test will measure the amount of tears produced to determine whether a pet has dry eye. 
"
"The third eyelid gland is responsible for producing approximately 33% of a dog’s tears. When the gland prolapses it may become damaged, predisposing the pet to chronic dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca or KCS), even after the gland is repositioned. This is why it’s critical to monitor tear production throughout the pet’s life. If tear production is normal at the time of recheck, the Schirmer tear test will likely be done as an annual follow up.
"
"Unfortunately, cherry eye will not resolve without surgical intervention.
"
"If left untreated, the condition will persist, and the dog will be predisposed to developing chronic dry eye. The gland of the third eyelid is responsible for a significant amount of the tear production in dogs. Tears are critical to help flush debris, dust, pollen, and other pollutants out of dogs’ eyes. Without enough tears, dogs are more susceptible to eye infections and corneal ulcers.
"
"Cherry eye itself does not cause blindness in dogs. However, while unlikely, the secondary issues that occur due to untreated cherry eye can potentially cause blindness.
"
"Ointments and eye drops can be purchased over-the-counter to help to keep the eye lubricated, but unfortunately, there are no products that will specifically treat cherry eye in dogs.
"
"Eyelid protrusion itself does not hurt dogs. However, the secondary issues that can occur due to cherry eye can cause discomfort.
"
"When treated surgically, cherry eye generally does not recur in the same eye. However, the outcome greatly depends on the surgeon’s experience and technique utilized. One study found a failure rate of approximately 3% (97% of surgeries were successful). 
"
"If only one eye is affected and surgery is performed, this does not prevent the other eye from eventually becoming affected. Most dogs that develop cherry eye in both eyes will either have both eyes affected at the same time or have the second eye affected within three months of the first eye.

"Chorioretinitis is a medical condition that affects the eyes; the term refers to inflammation of the choroid and retina. The retina is a layered membrane that lines the inner eyeball and which contains the light-sensitive rods, cones, and cells that convert images into signals and send messages to the brain to allow for vision. The choroid is located immediately under the retina and is part of the middle layer of the eyeball that contains the blood vessels. The choroid is also called the posterior uvea., which is the entire middle layer of the eyeball that contains the blood vessels. The uvea is composed of the iris (the colored or pigmented part of the eye), the ciliary body (the area between the iris and the choroid), and the choroid. Spreading inflammation may result in separation of the back part of the eye (retina) from the underlying, vascular part of the eyeball (choroid); a condition known as retinal detachment. Chorioretinitis may be a sign of a generalized (systemic) disease, therefore, appropriate diagnostic testing is important.
"
"Dogs with uveodermatologic syndrome (an immune-mediated disease that causes inflammation of the eye and loss of clear sight, along with loss of pigment in the skin and whitening of the hair) may also present as inflammation in the front part of the eye, including the iris. In the case of an uveodermatologic condition, inflammation of the skin (dermatitis) will also require management. Uveodermatologic syndrome is more likely to occur in Akitas, Chow Chows, and Siberian Huskies. An immune-mediated disease requires lifelong therapy to control inflammation of the choroid and retina.
"
"Other causes for chorioretinitis are generalized fungal infections, known as mycoses, which are more common in large, hunting-breed dogs; and a Borzoi breed-specific eye disorder with multiple areas of fluid build-up in the retina (referred to as retinal edema) or loss of tissue in the choroid and retina (chorioretinal atrophy) resulting in deterioration of the retina, causing pigmented and hyper-reflective areas (referred to as Borzoi chorioretinopathy). Secondary glaucoma, in which the pressure within the eye is increased secondary to inflammation in the eye, can also be a complication related to inflammation, and will also require treatment.
"
"When the uvea, the dark tissue at the front of the eye that contains the blood vessels, becomes inflamed, it creates a painful condition that is clinically referred to as anterior uveitis (which means, literally, inflammation of the front of the eye). This condition affects the dog's iris and the surrounding pupil tissue, which in turn, could threaten your dog's vision.
"
"Anterior uveitis may be due to different causes, including:
"
"Viruses are another cause of anterior uveitis in animals, however, the viral agents are different for each species. The canine herpes virus, canine distemper virus and canine adenovirus can cause the condition indogs. It is important to note that the canine adenovirus-1 can be prevented with a vaccine.
"
"Your veterinarian will want a complete medical history and will conduct a physical examination of your dog, usually using a special instrument to look at the eye (ophthalmoscope). The front of the inside of the eye, as well as the back part, will be examined to measure the pressure within the eye. The veterinarian will also order a complete blood count and a biochemical profile. This will be used to identify any autoimmune diseases, infectious organisms, or other diseases. Other tests for diagnoses include ultrasounds and X-rays of the eye, as well as an aspirate from the eye for microscopic examination.
"
"
"
"The course of treatment will depend on the diagnosis. However, this generally consists of prescribed drops or ointments to put in the dog's eye, as well as oral medications to reduce any pain or inflammation.
"
"Specific treatment will be recommended depending on the cause of the disease. For example, if infection is found, an antibiotic topical drug will be prescribed. If the underlying cause is a fungus, anti-fungal drugs will be prescribed.
"
"In extraordinary and rare situations (e.g., if there is a tumor causing secondary complications such as glaucoma), your veterinarian may recommend surgical removal of the eye.
"
"Pay attention to all of your veterinarian’s instructions. Putting medication in a dog's eye can be challenging, but it must be done for the sake of your pet's long term sight. Take time every day to look at your dog’s eyes carefully to look for any changes. Follow-up appointments are needed so that the veterinarian can examine the eye at regular intervals.
"
"It is also important to check the environment your pet lives in. Is it possible that it is contracting an infection -- especially a fungal infection -- there? You may need to make some changes in your animal's accommodations.

"Chorioretinitis is not usually painful except when the front part of the eye, including the iris, is affected. Some of the symptoms that may point to chorioretinitis include vitreous abnormalities, which can display as tearing, bleeding, or will show evidence of the vitreous becoming liquefied (the vitreous is the clear, gel-like material that fills the back part of the eyeball between the lens and the retina). A condition usually seen in dogs is invasion of the eye by fly larvae. Tracts from migrating larvae may be seen when the eye is examined with an ophthalmoscope.
"
"Changes in the appearance of the retina when examined with an ophthalmoscope may include change in color, darkened or lighter areas, scars, and changes in the contour/surface of the retina. A close examination may show few, or small, lesions.
"
"The conditions that can lead to chorioretinitis are varied, as you can see in the list below. Your veterinarian will need to consider biological, chemical, and genetic causes, just to name a few. There is also the possibility that a cause for the condition will not be found, in which case it will be classified as idiopathic (of unknown origin) in nature.

"Your veterinarian will use diagnostic tools that are both invasive and non-invasive in order to make a correct diagnosis of chorioretinitis. The non-invasive methods will include measuring your pet's blood pressure; screening a large area of the retina with indirect ophthalmoscopy (an instrument used for viewing the interior structure of the eye by use of a light reflecting mirror), or using direct  ophthalmoscopy for closer examination of the affected areas of the eye. If results are not conclusive at that point, the need for invasive procedures will become a factor in pinpointing the cause for the  chorioretinitis.
"
"Your veterinarian may be able to make a diagnosis by examining a fluid specimen from the eye, which will be a fairly simple procedure, or there may be a need for a deeper examination, in which case your doctor will want to take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (also called spinal fluid, the liquid that bathes the brain and spine) to look for infection, or for an indication of central nervous system disease or optic neuritis. Cerebrospinal fluid is removed through a procedure called a spinal tap, where a needle is inserted into the vertebrae of the spine and the fluid is allowed to collect into a vial. The sample is then sent to a lab for testing. It is a fairly quick procedure, but your pet would have to be sedated and might be affected for the rest of the day afterward.
"
"
"
"Treatment will be dependent on the physical condition of the patient, but is usually outpatient.
"
"The possible long-term complications of  chorioretinitis include permanent blindness, cataracts, glaucoma, and chronic eye pain. In the worst cases, death can occur secondary to a systemic disease.
"
"The expected course and prognosis for chorioretinitis is guarded to good for retaining vision, depending on the amount of retina affected and on the underlying cause. Visual deficits or blindness may be a permanent complication if large areas of the retina were destroyed. Focal and multifocal diseases do not markedly impair vision permanently, but do leave scars on the animal's eyes.

"Congenital abnormalities of the eyeball or its surrounding tissue are generally evident shortly after a puppy's birth, but may develop within the first six to eights weeks of life. Most defects are genetically inherited; for example, persistent pupillary membrane (PPM), which occurs when strands of fetal tissue remain on the eye after birth, is more prone in Basenjis, Pembroke and Cardigan Welsh Corgis, chow chows, and mastiffs.
"
"Meanwhile, persistent hyperplastic tunica vasculosa lentis (PHTVL) and persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) is most frequently inherited in Doberman pinschers. Multifocal retinal dysplasia (malformation of the retina) is found in English springer Spaniels; collie eye anomaly in collies, Shetland sheepdogs, and Australian shepherds; retinal dystrophy in Briards, photoreceptor dysplasia (malformation of the cells that perceive light and color) in Collies, Irish Setters, miniature schnauzers, and Norwegian elkhounds.
"
"Ocular abnormalities can also develop spontaneously (e.g., colobomas of ther anterior) or occur in utero. Exposure to toxic compounds, lack of nutrients, and systemic infections and inflammations during pregnancy (such as panleukopenia) are other potential risk factors for ocular abnormalities.
"
"There are a variety of abnormalities that can affect a dog's eye or surrounding tissues. The following are some of the more common issues and their corresponding signs:
"
"In addition, hereditary defects, such as corneal opacities, PPM, cataracts, retinal detachement, and dysplasia, are often associated with the following factors:
"
"You will need to provide as much of your dog's medical history as you have available to you, such as in utero conditions (i.e., whether its mother was ill, her diet, etc.), and the dog's development and environment after birth. After taking a thorough history, your veterinarian will test the health of the eye.
"
"A Schirmer tear test may be used to see if your dog's eyes are producing an adequate amount of tears. If high pressure in the eye (glaucoma) is suspected, a diagnostic tool called a tonometer will be applied to your dog's eye to measure its internal pressure. Abnormalities within the eye, meanwhile, will be examined with an indirect ophthalmoscope and/or a slitlamp biomicroscope.
"
"An ultrasound of the eyes may also reveal problems with the lens of the eyeball, the vitreous humor (the clear fluid which fills the space between the lens and retina), the retina, or other problems that are taking place in the posterior (back) segment of the eye. In the case of iris cysts, ultrasound will help your doctor determine if the mass behind the iris is in fact a cyst or a tumor. Cysts do not always behave uniformly: some grow, while others shrink. In most cases follow-ups to check the progress of the cyst will be the extent of treatment, until further intervention is warranted.
"
"Another useful diagnostic method called angiography can also be used for viewing problems in the posterior of the eye, such as detachment of the retina and abnormal blood vessels in the eye. In this method, a substance that is visible on X-ray (radiopaque) is injected into the area that needs to be visualized, so that the full course of blood vessels can be examined for irregularities.
"
"
"
"Treatment will depend on the specific type of eye abnormality that is affecting your dog. Depending on your veterinarian's experience with eye diseases, you may need further treatment with a trained veterinary ophthalmologist. Surgery can repair some congenital birth defects, and medicines can be used to mitigate the effects of some types of defects. Congenital keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), commonly known as dry eye, can often be medically treated with tear substitutes in combination with antibiotics. Other medicines called mydriatics may be used to increase vision when congenital cataracts are present in the center of your dog's eye lenses.
"
"In cases of photoreceptor dysplasia, there is no medical treatment that will delay or prevent its progress, but dogs with this condition generally do not suffer from any other physical abnormality and can learn to manage their environment very well, as long as they are able to depend on their environment being stable and safe.
"
"Congenital KCS requires frequent checkups with a veterinarian to monitor tear production and the status of the external eye structures. Abnormalities such as congenital cataracts, PHTVL, and PHPV require checkups twice yearly to monitor progression.
"
"In addition, since most congenital ocular anomalies are hereditary, you should not breed a dog that has been diagnosed with any of these disorders.

"While fear is a normal, adaptive response, sometimes a dog’s fear response can reach more extreme levels that require intervention. Profound fear and anxiety can lead to unhealthy and potentially dangerous behaviors within dogs.
"
"To help you better understand how to help, it’s necessary to understand the nuances and signs of anxiety, phobias and fear in dogs.
"
"When navigating fear-based behavioral issues in dogs, your veterinarian will work with you to determine the severity and root cause of the behaviors.
"
"Puppies can develop infections of the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane that lines the inner surface of the eyelids and the eyeball, or of the cornea, the transparent front surface coating of the eyeball. The infection will typically take place after the top and bottom eyelids separate and open, at about 10 to 14 days of age.
"
"Often the source of the infection is from infectious vaginal discharge that is transmitted at birth, but an unhygienic environment can also lead to infection in newborns. Staphylococcus spp. bacteria, or Streptococcus spp. bacteria are usually responsible for infections in puppies. If left untreated, infections of this nature can lead to blindness.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on the affected newborns, and will need a complete medical history of the pregnancy and birth, as well as a background medical history of the mother that has given birth. If your adult pet, the mother, has had any infections that you are aware of, you will need to share information of the symptoms and the time they began with the doctor. Even if there has not been any indication of infection in the mother, if the symptoms the newborn is presenting appear to be the type of infection that is transmitted through the birth canal, your veterinarian will need to take a culture of vaginal discharge from the mother.
"
"A culture of the eye discharge will also need to be taken for testing, and in order to fully examine the eye for possible trauma or lesions, your doctor will stain the cornea (the coating of the eye) with fluorescein, a fluorescent yellow-orange dye that illuminates the corneal surface, making even minute scratches and foreign objects visible under light.
"
"Your doctor may also order a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel, in case the newborn has an underlying systemic disease that also needs to be treated.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will separate the puppy's eyelids by moistening them and pulling them gently apart. Once the eyes have been opened, your veterinarian will be able to wash the eye and the eyelids to get the infected cellular matter out. To prevent the eyelids from sticking together again, warm compresses will be applied, and will be recommended for home treatment as well. Your veterinarian will also prescribe a topical antibiotic ointment to be applied to the eye.
"
"Apply warm (not hot) compresses to the eyes of affected puppies after returning home to prevent the eyelids from sticking together again, and follow through with the full course of the prescribed antibiotic medication. If it appears that the infection is limited to only one or a couple of the puppies in the litter, you will still need to be watchful for signs of eye infection in the litter-mates that appear healthy, so that you can act quickly if symptoms do appear.
"
"Some bacterial infections of the eye are highly contagious, and you will want to keep the uninfected newborns from contracting an infection. Have your veterinarian advise you on whether you will need to isolate the infected, or uninfected, newborns. (Do not isolate unless it is necessary, since it is important for the social and physical  development of the newborn puppy to be close to its mother and litter-mates.) Be sure to keep the eating and sleeping areas in which the newborns and mother occupy clean and hygienic, and wash the mother's nipples often, using only warm water -- no soap, as soap can lead to cracking and bleeding of the nipples -- or as your veterinarian advises.

"Fear is the instinctual feeling of apprehension caused by a situation, person or object that presents an external threat—whether it’s real or perceived.
"
"The response of the autonomic nervous system prepares the body for the freeze, fight or flight syndrome. It is considered to be a normal behavior that is essential for adaptation and survival.
"
"The context of the situation determines whether the fear response is normal or abnormal and inappropriate. Most abnormal reactions are learned and can be unlearned with gradual exposure (counter-conditioning).
"
"Profound fear (also called idiopathic fear) has been noted in certain dog breeds, including the Siberian Husky, German Shorthaired Pointer, Greyhound, Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Bernese Mountain Dog, Great Pyrenees, Border Collie and Standard Poodle, among others.
"
"The persistent and excessive fear of a specific stimulus is called a phobia.
"
"It has been suggested that once a phobic event has been experienced, any event associated with it—or even the memory of it—is sufficient enough to generate a response.
"
"The most common phobias in dogs are associated with noises (such as thunderstorms or fireworks).
"
"Anxiety, meanwhile, is the anticipation of unknown or imagined future dangers. This results in bodily reactions (known as physiologic reactions) that are normally associated with fear.
"
"The most common behaviors are elimination (i.e., urination and/or bowel movements), destruction and excessive vocalization (i.e., barking, crying). Pet owners may also observe excessive panting and/or pacing.
"
"Separation anxiety is the most common specific anxiety in companion dogs. With separation anxiety, a dog that’s left alone for a period of time exhibits anxiety or excessive distress behaviors.
"
"The clinical signs will vary depending on the severity of the fear or anxiety that the dog is suffering from. Here are some of the most common clinical signs:
"
"Mild fears: signs may include trembling, tail-tucking, hiding, reduced activity and passive escape behaviors
"
"Panic: signs may include panting, pacing, active escape behavior and increased out-of-context, potentially injurious motor activity
"
"Sympathetic autonomic nervous system activity, including diarrhea
"
"Lesions secondary to licking and biting their own body
"
"Tail-chasing and circling
"
"The onset of fear or anxiety issues in dogs can be prompted by a variety of things, from puppy socialization issues and age-related health conditions like dementia to traumatic experiences or genetics.
"
"There is no catchall for the roots of these issues, but here are some of the most common causes of anxiety or fear in dogs:
"
"Being forced into an unfamiliar and frightening experience
"
"Being deprived of social and environmental exposure until 14 weeks of age
"
"Phobias and panic: history of not being able to escape or get away from the stimulus causing the phobia and panic, such as being locked in crate
"
"Separation anxiety: history of abandonment, having multiple owners over time, being rehomed or experiencing prior neglect are all common sources; the condition may be perpetuated if the dog has been repeatedly abandoned or rehomed because they have separation anxiety.
"
" 
"
"Any illness or painful physical condition increases anxiety and contributes to the development of fears, phobias and anxieties.
"
" 
"
"Aging changes associated with nervous system changes, as well as infectious disease (primarily viral infections in the central nervous system) and toxic conditions may lead to behavioral problems, including fears, phobias and anxieties.
"
"Your veterinarian will first want to rule out other conditions that might be causing the behavior, such as brain, thyroid or adrenal disease. Blood tests will rule out or confirm possible underlying medical conditions.
"
"If your veterinarian diagnoses a simple fear, anxiety or phobia, they might prescribe anti-anxiety medication in addition to recommending management techniques and behavior modification exercises.
"
"Your doctor will make recommendations based on your individual dog’s fear trigger, or they will refer you to a veterinary behaviorist who can help your pet.
"
"Most forms of treatment will be done over the long-term, and could possibly span several years. It generally depends on the duration and intensity of the clinical signs of anxiety. Minimum treatment averages four to six months. 
"
"Keep in mind that prescription medications are not right for every pet and are typically implemented only as a last resort in severe instances.
"
"If your dog has extreme panic and separation anxiety and needs to be protected until medications can become effective, which can take days to weeks, hospitalization may be the best choice.
"
"Otherwise, you will care for your dog at home and will need to provide protection from self-inflicted physical injury until your dog calms down. You may need to arrange for day care or dog-sitting.
"
"  
"
"Desensitization and counter-conditioning are most effective if the fear, phobia or anxiety is treated early. The goal is to decrease the reaction to a specific stimulus (such as being left alone).
"
"Desensitization is the repeated, controlled exposure to the stimulus that usually causes a fearful or anxious response. It is done at such a low intensity that the dog does not respond with fear or anxiety.
"
"Counter-conditioning is training the dog to perform a positive behavior in place of fear or anxiety.
"
"For example, you can teach your dog to sit and stay, and when your dog performs these tasks, you reward him. Then, when your dog is in a situation where he is usually fearful or anxious, you can redirect his attention by asking him to sit and stay.
"
"The signs of an oncoming anxiety attack are subtle in dogs. You should learn to recognize your dog’s physical signs of fear, phobias and anxiety so that you can intervene before your dog panics.
"
"If your dog is on medications, your veterinarian will want to conduct occasional blood testing to make sure your dog’s body can process and eliminate the medications appropriately.
"
"If behavior modification does not work over the long-term, your veterinarian may want to modify the approach. If left untreated, these disorders are likely to progress.
"
"You will need to help your dog with behavior modification exercises and teach your dog to relax in a variety of environmental settings. Encourage calmness when your dog appears distressed. Distract him and redirect his attention, following the plan your vet has set for you.
"
"Fearful or anxious dogs may need to live in a protected environment with as few social stressors as possible. They do not do well in dog shows, dog parks or large crowds.
"
"And remember that not all dogs are calmer when crated; some dogs panic when caged and will injure themselves if forced to be confined. Absolutely avoid punishment for behavior related to fear, phobia or anxiety.
"
"Contact your veterinarian for a referral to get professional help with your dog’s behavior modification.

"Electrolytes are very important for many functions in the body. They are required for normal heart and brain functions, fluid balance, to deliver oxygen, and many more. A very delicate balance is required, for each electrolyte has a specific level in the body. Sodium is required for many vital functions in the body including: the regulation of blood pressure, blood volume, the transmission of nerve impulses (signals), as well as the maintenance of acid/base balance in the body.
"
"The term hypernatremia means higher than normal concentrations of sodium in blood. Such elevations are commonly seen in abundant loss of water through gastrointestinal tract along with sodium or low water intake. A common source is sodium chloride (NaCl, table salt). Alterations in sodium levels usually accompany chloride level changes, and symptoms related to both are present together.
"
"Your veterinarian will take a detailed history of your dog, including a history of any previous medical treatment. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory tests include: complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, which will reveal high levels of sodium along with other abnormalities. For dogs with diabetes, urinalysis will reveal changes in urine, including low sodium levels. More specific testing for diagnosis of underlying diseases may need to be carried out.
"
"
"
"Fluid therapy is commonly used to correct the electrolyte balance. In dehydrated dogs, fluid therapy needs to be carried out over some time to correct fluid and electrolyte derangements. Your veterinarian will measure the sodium and other electrolyte levels during and after the treatment to ensure that levels of electrolytes are within normal ranges. Treatment of underlying causes (e.g., diabetes) is essential for complete resolution of the problem and to prevent future episodes.
"
"Follow guidelines given by your dog’s veterinarian. Ensure continuous supply of water for those patients with diabetes. A sodium restricted diet may be suggested for your dog. Don’t give treats to your dog, especially those with sodium chloride, without discussing with your veterinarian. Stick with the diet recommended for your dog until complete recovery is achieved.
"
"Most dogs with hypernatremia without any underlying disease respond well and prognosis is excellent. However, animals with an underlying disease responsible for electrolyte derangements, prognosis depends on treatment of the disease along with correction of electrolyte imbalances.

"Exercise-induced collapse (EIC) is a genetic condition in affected dogs that causes progressive weakness and collapse after strenuous exercise. It results from a gene mutation that is responsible for maintaining muscle tone during periods of exercise.
"
"EIC begins with weakness in the hind limbs that progresses to the front limbs with sustained exercise. This leads to collapse and inability to move the limbs until the dog recovers.
"
"Affected dogs typically are okay when performing light-to-moderate exercise, but when intensity increases, problems arise. As little as five minutes of intense exercise can trigger an episode.
"
"EIC is relatively rare in dogs overall but is most common in Labrador Retrievers. Male and female dogs are affected equally. The onset of symptoms usually begins by the time the dog is 3 years old. It often goes undiagnosed until the first episode, because these dogs appear normal—both medically and physically—prior to the onset of strenuous exercise.
"
"Although most dogs recover on their own within about 30 minutes, some dogs do experience severe reactions that can be fatal. This is especially common if exercise is continued even after the dog begins showing signs of weakness.
"
"If you notice your dog becoming weak or collapsing following exercise, it should be treated as a medical emergency. Your dog should be brought to the veterinarian to determine the underlying cause. 
"
"If your dog is diagnosed with EIC, your veterinarian can advise you on how to handle future episodes based upon your dog’s unique needs and overall health.
"
"Exercise-induced collapse can cause a variety of symptoms in affected dogs, which include the following:
"
"Wide stance
"
"Muscle weakness, especially in the hind legs
"
"Dragging hind legs
"
"Lack of coordination, stumbling
"
"Sudden collapse during exercise
"
"Inability to move after exercise
"
"Increased heart rate
"
"Rapid breathing
"
"Increased temperature (fever)
"
"Seizures (rare)
"
"It’s important to note that symptoms will get progressively worse if exercise is not stopped at the first sign of weakness. Watch your dog closely and discontinue exercise immediately if an abnormal walk is seen.
"
"EIC is caused by an inherited gene mutation. This means it can be passed down through generations. Strenuous exercise causes EIC in dogs with this mutation. Examples of exercise that may result in EIC include the following:
"
"Playing ball
"
"Running
"
"Agility competitions
"
"Intense training
"
"Playing with other dogs
"
"Some dogs are predisposed to this condition compared with others. In addition to Labrador Retrievers, Cocker Spaniels, Corgis, German Wirehaired Pointers, and Old English Sheepdogs are also commonly diagnosed with EIC.
"
"To diagnose this condition, veterinarians first perform full physical and neurological exams and collect a thorough history from the dog’s pet parent.
"
"A sample of blood will be collected to check for signs of inflammation, infection, or underlying illnesses. Sometimes, X-rays are needed to rule out underlying skeletal issues that may require sedation if your dog is nervous or unable to remain still.
"
"If these tests are all normal, a DNA test can check for the genetic mutation causing EIC.
"
"This test involves swabbing the inside of your dog’s cheek and sending it to a special laboratory for testing. If your dog has the genetic mutation and has had symptoms consistent with exercise-induced collapse, this condition is definitively diagnosed.
"
"There are no medical treatments available for EIC.
"
"Instead, treatment consists of limiting exercise and reducing triggers that may lead to collapse. Pet parents should keep their dog on a leash when outside to prevent them from running around.
"
"They will also need plenty of enrichment, such as puzzle toys or a stuffed Kong® that will provide them something to do while keeping them safe.
"
"EIC doesn't shorten your dog’s lifespan, but pet parents will need to limit their dog’s activity to only mild exercise, such as short walks, to prevent symptoms.
"
"Dogs typically experience fewer episodes as they age.
"
"Most dogs recover and return to normal within 30 minutes after an episode of EIC; however, for some dogs, EIC can be fatal.
"
"If you notice early signs of EIC, such as weakness in the hind legs, stop your dog from exercising immediately.
"
"Provide them with a calm, quiet environment to recover, and avoid any additional stressors.
"
"Because exercise can increase a dog’s body temperature, it's a good idea to use a fan to help cool your dog down. If your dog is alert and oriented, offer them some cool water.
"
"Call your veterinarian for additional guidance. 
"
"Because EIC is caused by a genetic mutation, the only way to prevent this condition is to not breed carriers of the mutated gene. In dogs who have the condition, limiting triggers and avoiding strenuous exercising can prevent symptoms. 
"
"Dogs with EIC generally live normal, healthy lives. However, pet parents should ensure they are avoiding trigger activities that result in EIC, to improve their quality of life.
"
"EIC can be dangerous, particularly if exercise is not stopped at the first sign of symptoms. Progression of symptoms can lead to death in some dogs.

"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a disorder which causes an abnormal amount of bacteria to accumulate in the small intestine. While it is common for this organ to have bacteria, it can become a problem when the count is too high. This can then affect the normal intestinal functions, causing loose stools and weight loss. Often clearing up within a few days, and up to a few weeks, treatment options give this bacterial infection an excellent prognosis.
"
"Common symptoms include loose stools, rapid weight loss, diarrhea, occasional vomiting and intestinal tract sounds (gurgling caused by gas).
"
"While a genetic predisposition has been determined as a non-factor for the disorder, some breeds have a higher prevalence in developing it. Among them, German Shepherds and Chinese Shar Peis seem to have the highest incidence rate among dog breeds. Inadequate levels of thyroid, low pancreatic production of enzymes, low levels of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and intestinal disease are also common causes for this bacterial overgrowth.
"
"Veterinarians will often perform blood work and bacterial cultures to determine the causes of the intestinal condition. In some cases a more invasive procedure, such as an endoscopy, will be required to view the intestine internally.
"
"Treatment is commonly given on an outpatient basis and improvement can occur quickly, typically within a few days and up to a few weeks. It is often recommended that the patient be placed on a highly-digestible diet to create less of an impact on the intestines during the healing. Antibiotics are also commonly prescribed to treat the bacterial growth.
"
"It is important to monitor your dog's weight and protein levels (albumin) over time to ensure that progress is being made toward a full recovery. Diarrhea must also be observed because if prolonged, it can lead to severe dehydration. In addition, repeat treatments may be required. The prognosis of this disease is positive when it is not associated with other serious medical conditions, such as intestinal cancer.
"
"There are currently no known preventative methods for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

"Hypercapnia is characterized by an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. Carbon dioxide is a normal part of the atmosphere, and a normal component of the chemical make-up of the mammalian body. Carbon dioxide is the end product of aerobic cellular metabolism (the function of cells that require oxygen to operate). It is considered the primary drive to breath, by stimulation of central chemoreceptors in the medulla oblongata (the lower portion of the brainstem). It is carried in the blood in three forms: 65 percent is as a bicarbonate; 30 percent is bound to hemoglobin; and 5 percent is dissolved in plasma.
"
"As a natural part of the atmosphere and the air that is inhaled, carbon dioxide is constantly being added to and removed from the air cells in the lungs. The normal amount of carbon dixide in the arterial blood is 35-45 mm Hg (a measurable unit of pressure). However, an excess of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream can lead to an abnormal condition, causing symptoms ranging from dizziness to convulsions. Left untreated, a state of hypercapnia can lead to death.
"
"Hypercapnia is synonymous with hypoventilation, or inadequate inhalation of fresh air.  It is generally the result of alveolar hypoventilation – a failure of the air cells in the lungs to take in adequate amounts of clean oxygen. It may also be related to lung disease or to environmental conditions that result in increased levels of carbon dioxide in the breathable air. Any breed, age, or gender of dog can be affected by this disorder.
"
"Because the brain is primarily affected by this condition, nervous system signs abound. Other symptoms include:
"
"Hypoventilation that results from a decrease in alveolar ventilation; may be the result of one of the following:
"
"It may also occur spontaneously in patients during inhalation of  anesthesia or due to increased inhaled carbon dioxide, such as what  occurs from rebreathing gases that had been exhaled. The most common  cause, however, is due to an exhausted carbon dioxide absorbent in the  anesthesia machine is the most common cause.
"
"Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. If your dog is conscious, your doctor will check your dog for the presence of hyperthermia (body temperature that is too high), hypoxemia (lack of oxygen), and head trauma.  If your dog is not conscious, especially if it is due to being anesthetized, your veterinarian will check your dog for hypoxemia.
"
"If none of these disorders are found to be the cause of the symptoms, your veterinarian will perform an upper airway endoscopy to rule out a laryngeal mass or paralysis of the larynx (muscles of the throat).
"
"
"
"The definitive treatment is to treat the primary cause, discontinue  inhalation anesthesia, or provide adequate ventilation during  anesthesia. Your veterinarian will begin by providing adequate ventilation into the air cells of the lungs. If your dog is anesthetized, your doctor will accomplish ventilation manually or mechanically with an anesthesia ventilator.
"
"Non-anesthetized dogs with severe pulmonary or central nervous system disease can be treated by mechanical ventilation with a critical care ventilator, but the dog may require heavy sedation for this treatment. Supplemental oxygen will be determined by the primary disease, since providing supplemental oxygen without providing ventilation generally will not correct hypercapnia.
"
"Your doctor will assess the effectiveness of supportive (ventilation) and definitive treatment. This should result in a decrease in the respiratory effort. Arterial blood gas will be evaluated to determine improvement, and to assess the adequacy of your dog's ability to take in adequate amounts of free oxygen as needed.

"In the event that there is a high volume of iron present in the blood, damage can occur within the cells. While iron is an essential nutrient for the regular functioning of a dog's body, when it is present in large quantities in the bloodstream, it can become lethal. Dogs may be ingesting unhealthy amounts of iron when they are being given multivitamins that are not appropriate for their age, size or health status, or when they are ingesting dietary supplements or pregnancy supplements that have been left within their reach but that are not intended for them. 
"
"Iron toxicity occurs in dogs in four separate stages.
"
"Stage I (0–6 hours)
"
"Stage II (6–24 hours)
"
"Stage III (12–96 hours)
"
"Stage IV (2–6 weeks)
"
"The most common cause of iron toxicity is the ingestion of pills within the home environment. A toxic dose is considered to be in excess of 20 mg/kg.
"
"Your veterinarian will need a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. If there is an abnormally high level of iron in the bloodstream, this will show up on the results of the blood tests. If it is suspected that your dog ingested iron pills, diagnostic imaging may be used to help locate them and to determine whether they can be removed from your dog's digestive system before they can be fully absorbed into the body.
"
"
"
"Fluids will be given to the dog in high doses to help correct the shock and to correct the acidosis that is occurring in the dog's blood stream. If possible, the additional unabsorbed iron pills will be removed from your dog's stomach, either by using antiemetic drugs to induce vomiting, or by performing a gastric lavage. This latter method is done with a saline solution that is slowly pumped into the stomach cavity to wash the contents of the stomach out. The contents are removed in small amounts using another tube.
"
"It is important to monitor the dog's blood enzymes and liver enzymes following the treatment. Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up exam to test your dog's blood to make sure that the iron levels have been controlled. It is also important for you to observe your dog for any signs of gastrointestinal obstruction following the iron toxicity, as the digestive system may react to the toxicity or the medical procedures that were used to resolve the toxicity.

"An inflammatory breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier that allows for entry of blood cells into the front (anterior) chamber of the eye, further allowing for an accumulation of white blood cells in this this chamber, is characteristic of a condition known as hypopyon. Chemoattractants, the chemical substances that influence the migration of cells, can act as a conveyor for this cellular movement. The cells often settle in place because of gravity, forming a fluid line in the lower front chamber of the eye.
"
"Lipid flare, on the other hand, resembles hypopyon, but the clouded appearance of the anterior chamber is caused by a high concentration of lipids (the fatty substance in the cells) in the aqueous humor (the thick watery substance between the eye's lens and cornea). It requires a breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier and concurrent hyperlipidemia (an elevation of lipids in the blood stream) to occur. There is no age, gender or breed predilection.
"
"Hypopyon
"
" Lipid flare

"
"Hypopyon
"
"Any underlying condition which causes uveitis – inflammation of the middle layer of the eye – can result in hypopyon. Most commonly, hypopyon is associated with severe forms of uveitis, but hypopyon can also result from tumor cell accumulation in cases that involve ocular lymphoma (eye tumors).
"
"Lipid Flare
Lipid flare often results from a condition of hyperlipidemia (raised or abnormal levels of lipids – the fatty substance of the bloodstream – in the blood stream), and concurrent breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier (due to uveitis). Hyperlipidemia may also destabilize the blood-aqueous barrier directly. High levels of lipids in the circulating blood following a meal (postprandial lipemia) may occasionally result in the appearance of lipemic aqueous if uveitis is present.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and ocular examination on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition.
"
"Hypopyon may be diagnosed by the presence of fibrin (the protein end product of coagulated blood) in the anterior chamber – generally forms an irregular clot, not a ventrally located horizontal line.
"
"Lipid flare will need to be differentiated from severe aqueous flare, which does not appear as milky/white as lipid flare. Dogs that are affected with severe aqueous flare generally exhibit much more ocular pain than animals with lipid flare.
"
"Magnesium is found mostly in bones and muscles, and is required for many smooth metabolic functions. However, abnormally high levels of magnesium in the blood can result in serious complications, like impaired nerve impulses and cardiac problems. This health issue is called hypermagnesemia.
"
"Hypermagnesemia leads to the progressive loss of respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, and muscle functions -- all of which can be fatal in the dog. Other symptoms associated with this issue include:
"
"After recording a detailed history from you, the veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory tests include: a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These tests help determine the levels of magnesium in the blood, which will record more than normal in affected dogs. Abnormally high levels of calcium are also found in affected dogs. As hypermagnesemia mostly occurs in patients with kidney problems, urinalysis and other laboratory tests may reveal abnormalities related to an underlying disease. Additionally, your veterinarian will perform an electrocardiography (ECG), as characteristic ECG changes are seen in patients with hypermagnesemia.
"
"
"
"The major goal of treatment is to enhance the elimination of extra magnesium from the body. Therefore, all medications containing magnesium will be discontinued to prevent further aggravation of symptoms. Fluid therapy will be started to enhance the excretion of magnesium from the body of your dog. Calcium is also added in your dog’s therapy to enhance the excretion of magnesium.
"
"During and/or after treatment, your veterinarian will conduct laboratory testing to see the levels of magnesium. An ECG will be conducted to see the dog's cardiac functions.
"
"Prognosis in dogs with hypermagnesemia without kidney involvement is excellent after initial therapy. In cases of kidney disease, on the other hand, treating the underlying disease is essential for resolution of the problem on a permanent basis. Levels of magnesium will be monitored during and after the treatment. After discharge, if you see any untoward signs, immediately call your cat’s veterinarian.

"Diffuse corneal edema, a severe corneal edema, may be confused with anterior chamber opacity, but corneal stromal (connective tissue) thickening, keratoconus (degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye), and corneal bullae (fluid-filled blister) are more typically noted with diffuse corneal edema than with hypopyon or lipid flare.
"
"
"
"Hypopyon requires aggressive treatment for the uveitis and its underlying cause. Outpatient treatment is generally adequate, but you will need to be aware that there is still a significant chance that your dog will lose its sight. Lipid flare requires treatment for the uveitis, which is usually mild, and any underlying metabolic disorders. If your dog is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, you will need to change the dog's diet to one that is lower in fat and calories, in order to decrease the amount of fat in the bloodstream. Outpatient treatment, with anti-inflammatory drugs prescribed for home administration, is generally adequate.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule a check-up for your dog at two to three days after the initial treatment. Intraocular (within the eyes) pressure should be monitored to detect secondary glaucoma. The frequency of subsequent rechecks will be dictated by the severity of the disease and your dog's individual response to treatment.
"
"The expected prognosis may depend heavily on what the underlying condition is behind the eye condition. For example, with hypopyon, the prognosis is guarded depending on the underlying disease and response to treatment. With lipid flare, the prognosis is usually good. It generally responds quickly (within 24–72 hours) to moderate anti-inflammatory therapy. However, keep in mind that recurrence and the need for further treatment is possible with lipid flare.

"Behind the thyroid gland in the neck, there lie four parathyroid glands which secrete the hormone the body needs to regulate calcium and phosphorus. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D interactions work to release calcium from the bones, gut, and kidneys for deposit into the bloodstream. When these interactions are disturbed, or when cancerous cells secrete hormones that interfere with calcium regulation, hypercalcemia can result. Hypercalcemia is characterized by an abnormally high amount of calcium in the blood. A dog is considered hypercalcemic when its total serum calcium is greater than 11.5 mg/dL.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, with a blood chemistry profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. While a high serum is crucial to the diagnosis of hypercalcemia, the results of the other tests will help to indicate the origin of the hypercalcemia.
"
"Radiograph and ultrasound imaging can also be used for diagnosing underlying conditions, such as kidney disease, bladder stones, or cancer. Fine needle aspirates (liquids) from the lymph nodes and bone marrow can be used for diagnoses of lymphoma, or cancer of the blood.
"
"
"
"If your dog has been diagnosed with hypercalcemia, your veterinarian will very likely want to hospitalize it for fluid therapy. Once the primary disease is diagnosed, your dog will be given the appropriate medication(s). Your doctor will continue to check your dog’s serum calcium twice a day during its stay at the veterinary clinic, until calcium levels have returned to normal.
"
"Your veterinarian will set up a schedule of follow-up appointments for your dog dependent on the underlying cause of the hypercalcemia.

"The condition known as hyperchloremia refers to abnormally high levels of chloride (an electrolyte) in the blood. Electrolytes play important roles within the dog's body: helping in heart and nervous system functions, fluid balance, delivery of oxygen, and much more. For every electrolyte a very delicate chemical balance is required, and each electrolyte has a specific normal range in the body.
"
"The electrolyte chloride, for example, is responsible in part for metabolism (turning food into energy), and keeping the body's acid base balanced. Chloride exists in body with sodium (Na) and their common source is sodium chloride (NaCl or table salt). Therefore, conditions responsible for altering the levels of sodium also affect chloride levels in the body. Elevated chloride levels are usually seen in dogts suffering from kidney diseases, diabetes, or bouts of diarrhea.
"
"Hyperchloremia is seen in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Symptoms of sodium elevation may also exist along with those of hyperchloremia, including:
"
"Your veterinarian will want a complete medical history of the dog from you and will conduct a complete physical examination, with routine laboratory tests: complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis.
"
"
"
"Biochemistry profile results will show abnormally high levels of chloride, often coupled with high sodium levels, and in cases in which diabetes is also involved, blood sugar levels may be abnormal as well. Meanwhile, urinalysis will often reveal abnormalities related to kidney diseases. Laboratory tests will also demonstrate abnormalities related to any underlying disease like diabetes.
"
"
"
"The symptoms will be treated first in order to maintain your dog's immediate health. If the dog is dehydrated, fluids will be given to balance body fluids. Treatment involves treating the underlying disease as well as correcting the levels of both chloride and sodium in the blood. Your veterinarian will select intravenous fluid to balance the levels of both of these electrolytes. If the hyperchloremia has been caused by medications, they will be discontinued immediately.
"
"Because it is possible that the increase in chloride is being caused by an underlying physical disorder, treatment will vary depending on the final diagnosis. If your dog has been diagnosed with diabetes, it will be essential to resolve the problem related to it to prevent recurrence. Kidney disease, or a hormonal or endocrine disorder may require specialists, depending on the magnitude of the problem.
"
"If there is no underlying diseases associated with the abnormally high chloride levels, the dog should recover completely with initial treatment. However, if something is amiss, it is important to treat the underlying disease to facilitate a speedy recovery and prevent recurrence.

"Dog drooling can be normal for many pups. But if your dog is drooling a lot more than usual—or if they never drool and then your dog is suddenly drooling excessively—it’s cause for concern.
"
"Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a rare syndrome, characterized by an excess of acids in the dog's blood. This is due to the kidney's inability to excrete sufficient acid through the urine. Dogs with RTA will also have abnormal levels of potassium in the blood. This condition occurs as a part of the metabolic process, by which food is transformed into energy. And although RTA is seen in both cats and dogs, it rarely occurs in cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit &lt;a target=""&gt;this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Some common symptoms which may be observed include:
"
"There are two primary RTA types: type 1 RTA (or distal), involves reduced hydrogen ion secretion in the kidney, and type 2 RTA (or proximal), which is characterized by the inability to excrete acid into the urine. Abnormal metabolic processing of bicarbonates is referred to as metabolic acidosis, and is marked by abnormally high levels of acids in the blood, and abnormally low levels of acids in the urine.
"
"Type 2 proximal renal tubular acidosis has been documented in dogs in association with Fanconi syndrome, a genetically recessive disease of the kidneys in which the kidneys are unable to reabsorb phosphate, glucose, and amino acids, spilling them into the urine. This activity causes an imbalance of acids in the blood, leading to renal tubular acidosis. 
"
"Some of the common underlying causes of RTA include infection of the kidney and ureter(s), and feline hepatic lipidosis, a type of liver disease. However, there are times when the RTA is idiopathic.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel.  Your veterinarian will  use the results of the blood work to rule out, or confirm an underlying systemic disease. You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.
"
"The results from a blood gases analysis, along with the results of the electrolyte panel, should indicate a normal anion gap (sum of the cations minus the anions in the plasma) with metabolic acidosis, indicating that the alkaline urine is abnormal. This is a key diagnostic feature of type 1 RTA.
"
"
"
"Your dog will be hospitalized until it no longer shows metabolic acidosis or low potassium levels. There they will be given potassium citrate and sodium citrate (sometimes replaced with sodium bicarbonate) until the metabolic acidosis and low potassium levels normalize.  Potassium gluconate may also be given to dogs with low potassium levels.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor any underlying disease your dog may have, and to follow your pet's progress. Dogs without an underlying disease have a good prognosis for recovery when the condition has been treated appropriately and effectively.

"Excessive drooling in dogs can have a lot of different causes. Here’s some insight on what to check for, what might be causing your dog to drool a lot, and when to seek help from a vet.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"When a dog eats, the salivary glands in their neck and jaw area produce saliva to help with digestion. Drooling occurs when this saliva escapes the mouth. It may happen if your dog sees a treat or when you’re opening a can or bag of dog food.
"
"Dog drooling is not an issue in most breeds. However, breeds with large upper lips—such as the Mastiff and St. Bernard—will usually drool more than others.
"
"Many conditions can cause dog drooling. A few common reasons include:
"
"Gastrointestinal disorders—Conditions involving the gastrointestinal tract, such as esophagitis, gastritis, enteritis, pancreatitis, foreign body obstruction, gastric ulceration, inflammatory bowel disease, and gastrointestinal cancers can cause drooling in dogs. Usually this is secondary to nausea caused by these medical conditions.
"
"Gum (periodontal) disease or other oral issue—Drooling can be caused by periodontal disease such as gingivitis or stomatitis, or other oral problems such as a sialocele, tumor, or infection. Look for other signs such as a mass, blood, pus, or bad breath.  
"
"Mouth injury—Blunt force trauma, chewing on a sharp object, or foreign material that’s lodged in the mouth (splinter or piece of bone) may be to blame.
"
"Chemical or electrical burn—Many caustic chemicals, such as battery acid, and any electrical burn (for example, from chewing an electrical cord) can cause bleeding and sometimes drooling. Chemical burns are often accompanied by pain and lesions, and your pet may paw at their mouth. Call your vet right away if you suspect these types of injury.
"
"Toxins and venoms—Consuming a poisonous plant, food, or drug can cause anything from drooling and pawing at the mouth to life-threatening side effects. Animal venom or secretions, such as a bite from a black widow spider or licking a toad, can also cause your dog to drool.
"
"Anxiety—You might notice excessive salivation as the result of anxiety caused by going to the vet, moving to a new home, or even riding in a car. Your dog may also be restless, pant, or have diarrhea along with the drooling.
"
"Pain in the abdomen—Abdominal pain often appears together with other signs, such as restlessness, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or even abdominal distention. Some dogs will guard their abdomen to avoid being touched where it hurts.
"
"Neurological conditions—Dog drooling could indicate damage to the nerve that connects to the salivary gland, damage to the salivary gland, or damage to the brain. You may also see uneven pupils, lethargy, and weakness. Some neurological conditions can also make it hard for your dog to swallow their saliva. If your dog has difficulty swallowing, call your vet right away. 
"
"Viral or bacterial infection—Rabies and tetanus can both cause drooling in dogs.
"
"Congenital defects—These are conditions that dogs are born with. A few examples include a hiatal hernia (when the upper section of the abdomen pushes into the chest) or portosystemic shunt, a circulatory abnormality.
"
"When dog drooling is due to a medical condition, it's often associated with other symptoms. Seek immediate veterinary help if your dog shows other signs, such as:
"
"Vomiting or regurgitation
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Bleeding
"
"Lethargy or weakness
"
"Loss of appetite or other changes in eating behavior
"
"Changes in behavior, such as aggressiveness or whining, which can indicate pain
"
"Dizziness, head-tilting, or trouble with balance
"
"Difficulty swallowing
"
"Uneven pupils
"
"Restlessness or panting
"
"Abdominal distention
"
"Pawing at the mouth
"
"To diagnose excessive do drooling, your vet will do a physical exam and will check your pup’s mouth and neck. They will take a full medical history, including vaccinations, medications, exposure to potential poisons, and foreign objects that your dog could have eaten.
"
"Your vet may recommend certain diagnostic tests, depending on the most likely suspected cause. These tests may include bloodwork and X-rays. If the issue appears to be more serious, you vet may refer you to a specialty referral facility for advanced diagnostics potentially including CT, MRI, ultrasound, or even endoscopic or surgical biopsies.
"
"Depending on the cause, treatment of dog drooling may include:
"
"Dental treatment—If the cause is due to periodontal disease, your vet may advise cleaning or teeth removal.
"
"Medication—Such as antibiotics if the cause of your dog’s drooling is bacterial.
"
"Surgery—Your pup may need surgery if the cause is trauma, tumors, or congenital defects.
"
"Radiation or chemotherapy—These treatment methods may also be suggested to treat tumors.
"
"Pain medication and anti-inflammatory medications
"
"Medicated mouthwash (with diluted chlorhexidine or benzoyl peroxide)
"
"The ability to prevent excessive dog drooling may depend on the underlying cause.
"
"However, some basic guidelines include trying to prevent GI upset and ingestion of foreign bodies. Use caution to help prevent your furry friend from getting into food and non-food items that they should not eat.
"
"If you are changing your dog's diet, do so slowly with a transition from old to new food. 
"
"Being vigilant about your pup's oral health may also be a good way to help prevent dental problems that can lead to drooling. Brushing your pet’s teeth can help keep them healthy. There are many other options for dogs who dislike brushing including dental wipes, powders, and water additives. 
"
"Yes! Dog drooling is a common sign of nausea or upset stomach in dogs.  This may be accompanied by inappetence, vomiting, or diarrhea. If your pet is showing these symptoms, you should give your veterinarian a call as they may need an in-person vet visit to feel better.
"
"Dog drooling can be normal in some pups.
"
"However, if the drooling is new or excessive, it could be signs of a medical condition including upset stomach, dental disease, and more. A vet visit could help determine the cause and if your dog needs any tests or treatments.
"
"Not typically. If a dog is drooling more as they age, they could have developed dental disease or even oral tumors. If your dog is drooling a lot, a vet visit is recommended to determine why.

"Surgical removal of the uterus and ovaries in a female dog is called an ovariohysterectomy. This type of surgery results in the cessation of subsequent estrus (heat) symptoms in the female. However, sometimes after an ovariohysterectomy, some female dogs continue to exhibit the behavioral and/or physical signs pertaining to estrus. This is typically found to be the result of ovary tissue being left behind. If such tissue remains functional and continues to secrete hormones, behavioral and/or physical signs of estrus in the female dog are seen. Such symptoms are usually seen within a few days after surgery and are not uncommon after an ovariohysterectomy.
"
"You will need to give a thorough medical history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and when your dog had the ovariohysterectomy. The history will usually include behavioral changes and signs of estrus that have occurred even after a successful surgical removal of the ovaries and uterus had been done. After taking a complete history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination. Standard laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. It is not unusual for the results of these tests to return within normal ranges.
"
"More specific tests for measuring your dog's hormones may show estrogen and progesterone levels that are higher than should be expected in a post-surgery dog. A cytological examination of samples taken from the vagina will also help in determining the status of estrus in your dog. In addition, ultrasound can be used to determine whether any ovarian tissue residues are present. However, in some cases abdominal surgery may be required to confirm the presence of ovarian tissue. If this is found to be the case, removal of these residual tissues can take place at that time.
"
"
"
"After reaching a confirmatory diagnosis, your veterinarian will consult with you about a second round of surgery to remove any left-over functioning ovarian tissue.
"
"Prognosis is very good after the removal of ovarian tissue residues has been performed. All abnormal symptoms should resolve soon after surgery.
"
"Patients undergoing an ovariohysterectomy or follow-up surgery to remove remaining tissue will need painkillers for a few days after surgery. Preventive antibiotics are also used for some patients to prevent infection. Give medications as prescribed and follow the guidelines for proper nutrition and medication. Do not give any additional medications or supplements to your dog without first consulting your veterinarian.

"A delicate balance of acid and alkali exists in the blood, and bicarbonate serves to maintain the delicate balance of acid and alkali in the blood, also known as the pH balance, which is chiefly maintained by the lungs and kidneys. Metabolic alkalosis in dogs can occur when bicarbonate (HCO3) levels increase to abnormally high levels in the blood. Diseases affecting the kidney and gastrointestinal tract functions are usually involved in the disruption of the acid and alkali balance in the blood. Though it must be pointed out that metabolic alkalosis is a secondary phenomenon and some other underlying disease is usually responsible for this problem. Metabolic alkalosis can occur in dogs of any breed, size, age, or gender.
"
"Symptoms are generally related to the underlying cause of the metabolic alkalosis. The general symptoms related to metabolic alkalosis include:
"
"After taking a complete history of your dog’s health, including a time line of how and when the symptoms began, your veterinarian will perform a physical examination on your dog. The next step will be to perform laboratory testing to check the levels of acid and alkali in the different body fluids. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Blood gas analysis is also very useful in the diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis. The laboratory testing usually provides sufficient information for your veterinarian to be able to confirm a diagnosis.
"
"
"
"Metabolic alkalosis does not occur independently, but as a result of an underlying cause that is responsible for the increase of alkali in the blood. Therefore, treatment of the underlying cause is of primary importance in correcting and further preventing complications of the metabolic alkalosis. In cases of severe, life-threatening metabolic alkalosis, emergency treatment is usually required. Drugs which may aggravate already existing metabolic alkalosis will be stopped. If there is vomiting, this will need to be treated, as it is one of the major factors in the development of metabolic alkalosis. Laboratory testing may need to be repeated to ensure that a complete recovery has been achieved, or whether further treatment is still required.
"
"After returning from hospital, keep a close eye on your dog for few days. If your dog begins to vomit again, or any other abnormality observed, call your veterinarian.

"The spleen is an organ in a dog’s abdomen just behind the stomach that helps manage red and white blood cells for the body. The spleen keeps the body healthy by filtering the blood, storing cells that don’t need to circulate, and destroying cells that have reached their age limit.
"
"A few conditions can cause abnormal growth and an enlarged spleen in dogs—referred to as splenomegaly. This is a relatively common abnormality and it can affect dogs of any age, size, or breed.
"
"Splenomegaly can be very uncomfortable as the enlarged spleen presses on abdominal organs like the stomach and intestines. Abnormally large spleens are also at greater risk of being damaged, which can lead to extensive bleeding due to a large number of blood vessels in the organ. Furthermore, there is a possibility of the spleen rupturing, exacerbating the condition and necessitating immediate medical attention.
"
"The prognosis for splenomegaly in dogs depends heavily on the cause of the enlargement and whether the spleen has ruptured. Dogs with a moderately enlarged spleen and no other symptoms may be stable but should be evaluated promptly by a veterinarian.
"
"A splenic rupture is a medical emergency and should be evaluated and treated immediately.
"
"Symptoms of an enlarged spleen in dogs include:
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Sudden weakness and difficulty getting up
"
"Collapse
"
"Vomiting
"
"Distended belly
"
"Pale gums
"
"Heavy panting
"
"High heart rate
"
"Weight loss
"
"When considering the potential causes of an enlarged spleen in dogs, various factors may contribute, including:
"
"Trauma to the abdomen
"
"Tumors (cancerous or benign)
"
"Liver infections (hepatitis)
"
"Severe stomach or intestinal inflammation (viral or autoimmune)
"
"Tick-borne diseases
"
"Blood infections
"
"Blood cancers
"
"Vets will likely suspect an enlarged spleen in dogs based on a physical exam and medical history.
"
"In many dogs, an abnormal spleen can be felt in the abdomen. This may be difficult in very large or overweight dogs, and your vet will probably recommend imaging of the abdomen to confirm the diagnosis.
"
"Splenomegaly in dogs should be visible on abdominal radiographs, although abdominal ultrasound can give valuable information, especially in cases where cancer is suspected. Chest X-rays may also be taken to look for evidence of cancer.
"
"A complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry, and urine testing can help evaluate potential causes of spleen enlargement, such as liver inflammation or leukemia (blood cancer). They can also assess for serious consequences of splenomegaly, like an abdominal bleed (hemoabdomen). A blood screen for heartworm and tick-borne diseases may help rule out infectious causes.
"
"If a tumor is suspected or if the cause of the enlarged spleen is still unknown, a biopsy is usually required. An aspirate of the spleen can be performed with an ultrasound-guided needle, though in most cases, your veterinarian will recommend removing the entire spleen (splenectomy) to prevent complications. While this organ serves an important function, the body has other organs that can compensate, and dogs can live happy, healthy lives without their spleen.
"
"When the spleen is enlarged due to problems elsewhere in the body, treatment is directed at the primary issue rather than the spleen itself.
"
"Viral and bacterial infections can usually be cured with medications. Rarer causes of enlarged spleen in dogs—such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or other immune disorders—may require long-term management with prescription diets and immunosuppressants to prevent recurrence.
"
"Non-cancerous causes of splenomegaly, like trauma and benign tumors, are commonly treated by splenectomy. Sick dogs may require hospitalization and even blood transfusions to stabilize them for surgery, but once they recover, these pups typically have a good long-term prognosis.
"
"Unfortunately, malignant cancers that affect the spleen, such as hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma, generally result in a poor prognosis, even with aggressive therapy.
"
"Splenectomy is usually indicated with hemangiosarcoma to improve comfort for as long as possible. If there isn’t significant bleeding, some pet parents may opt for palliative treatments such as anti-nausea medications, pain medications, and herbs to help prevent bleeding (e.g., Yunnan Baiyao).
"
"Chemotherapy can be used with or without surgery with many splenic cancers to give dogs more time, although how much will depend on the type of cancer.
"
"Systemic illnesses that cause enlarged spleen in dogs may take days to weeks to resolve, depending on the underlying cause. The spleen should return to its normal size once the primary condition has been treated, and affected dogs typically feel much better.
"
"Dogs who undergo splenectomy typically need two to three weeks to recover once they have left the hospital. If a blood transfusion was needed, follow-up blood tests are recommended, but these dogs can usually return to routine veterinary care once they have healed.
"
"If a malignant cancer is diagnosed in the spleen, surgical recovery is usually similar but long- term survival is not expected. The most common cancer found in a dog’s spleen is hemangiosarcoma. Even with surgery and chemotherapy, recurrence of this disease is common, and most dogs live less than a year after diagnosis.
"
"Frequent follow-up blood tests and imaging can help pet parents of dogs with splenic cancer monitor for complications.
"
"Routine vaccinations and parasite prevention can help avoid infectious causes of enlarged spleen in dogs.
"
"Unfortunately, cancers and even benign tumors of the spleen cannot be prevented. Routine wellness exams and blood work can help you and your veterinarian discover problems early.
"
"Weight loss, behavior changes, and appetite changes should be evaluated promptly by your vet.
"
"Enlarged spleens that are reacting to illness in a dog’s body can quickly return to normal size with appropriate treatment. An enlarged spleen in dogs that is caused by tumors or trauma will not resolve and may require surgery.

"Epilepsy is a common neurologic disorder affecting the brain and is defined by recurring seizures without a known cause. It is estimated to affect approximately 0.75% of dogs. 
"
"A seizure is caused by excessive electrical activity in the cortex of the brain. In dogs with epilepsy, the brain will appear structurally normal, but have abnormal electric impulses. Epilepsy is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is diagnosed only after all other possible causes have been ruled out. This is also called primary epilepsy or idiopathic.
"
"The abnormal electrical impulses start in one area of the brain (“seizure focus”) and spread throughout it causing involuntary movements and a loss of consciousness. This surge in electrical activity in the brain can cause a seizure that appears as twitching, shaking, tremors, and convulsions. 
"
"Seizures (neurologic events) can be confused with fainting spells (cardiovascular events). Seizures can be categorized into three phases:
"
"Aura: This is the pre-seizure feeling, as if the dog can sense that a seizure is coming.  During this phase the dog may appear anxious, frightened, or attention seeking behavior. This behavior may be hard for the pet parent to recognize.
"
"Ictal: This is the seizure itself which typically lasts 1-2 minutes, but you should seek immediate medical attention if it lasts more than 5 minutes. 
"
"Post-ictal: The post-ictal disorientation is the hallmark of seizures. During this period, the dog will be disoriented and may even appear blind. This can last for only a few minutes or up to several hours. In contrast, fainting animals are normal within seconds of the episode with no post-episode disorientation.
"
"Not all seizures look the same and knowing which type your dog is experiencing may help your veterinarian.
"
"An epulis refers to a benign (noncancerous) mass-like growth in the mouth that typically grows over or around a tooth. Epulides (plural of epulis) arise from the periodontal ligament, a small piece of tissue that connects the tooth and the surrounding bone.
"
"An epulis in dogs may be smooth or cobblestone in appearance and can grow in a mound or on a stalk. Epulides are usually the same color as a dog’s gums.
"
"These are the main types of epulides in dogs, which look and feel the same:
"
"Peripheral odontogenic fibroma (fibromatous and ossifying epulides)
"
"Acanthomatous ameloblastoma (acanthomatous epulides)
"
"Acanthomatous ameloblastomas may grow into the bone and cause movement or loosening of a dog’s teeth, or they can weaken the bone, which leads to a fracture.
"
"Not necessarily—there are several types of oral tumors in dogs and other possible illnesses that can create a growth in your dog’s mouth:
"
"Gingival hyperplasia is a condition where a dog’s gums grow in excess throughout their mouth, as opposed to discrete masses.
"
"Melanoma may form masses in the mouth that can be malignant (cancerous).
"
"Squamous cell carcinoma can also form tumors in the mouth and is an aggressive form of cancer.
"
"You may notice a growth in your dog’s mouth before they show any other symptoms. However, common symptoms of an epulis in dogs include:
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"The main categories are:
"
"Generalized (Grand Mal) Seizures: This is the most common form of seizure in dogs. In this type of seizure, the dog collapses falling over to its side and becomes unconscious, the limbs are extended and stiff, and there are convulsions or violent shaking. The dog may urinate or defecate on itself, hold its breath, and/or have chewing motions and drooling. All epileptic seizures are grand mal, but not all grand mal seizures are epilepsy, as other causes of seizures can result in grand mal type seizures.
"
"Partial (Focal) Seizures: Also called partial motor seizures, this type of seizure appears as abnormal movements restricted to only one part of the body, such as the face or one leg. However, a partial seizure will frequently spread and result in a generalized seizure. The differentiation is important because partial seizures are acquired (meaning there is an underlying cause) and are not seen with primary epilepsy. The classic exam of a partial seizure is a “chewing gum” seizure where the pet is conscious but involuntarily appears to be making a chewing gum motion with its mouth.
"
"Complex Partial Seizures: Also called psychomotor or behavioral seizures, this subset of focal seizures looks more like an episode of abnormal behavior than a tremor or convulsion. The dog is conscious but appears to be acting differently (including hysteria or rage) or hallucinating. The classic example is called “fly-biting” seizures, where the dog appears to chase and bite at an imaginary fly. 
"
"Clinical signs include:
"
"Stiffening of the body and legs
"
"Collapse and falling over to the side
"
"Chewing motion
"
"Drooling
"
"Paddling of the legs
"
"Urinating
"
"Defecating
"
"Vocalizing
"
"Violent shaking, trembling, and convulsing
"
"Epilepsy is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning all known causes of seizures must be ruled out before reaching a diagnosis of epilepsy. The first seizure in dogs with primary epilepsy is usually seen between the ages of 6 months and 5 years.
"
"Epilepsy may be inherited in some dogs. Dog breeds known to have a genetic basis include:
"
"Beagle
"
"Dachshund
"
"German shepherd dog
"
"Keeshond
"
"Belgian Tervuren
"
"Additionally, despite no known genetic link, certain dog breeds have a high incidence of epilepsy:
"
"Boxer
"
"Cocker spaniel
"
"Drooling
"
"Bad breath
"
"Bleeding from the mouth
"
"Chewing on one side of the mouth
"
"Reluctance to catch toys or play tug
"
"An epulis may cause movement or even loosening of a  dog’s teeth. This can result in mouth pain and having difficulty closing the mouth or chewing.
"
"The specific cause of this overgrowth of tissue is not known. Some breeds are predisposed to epulides, including Shetland Sheepdogs, Old English Sheepdogs, and brachycephalic (short-nosed) breeds such as American Bulldogs, English Bulldogs, and Boxers.
"
"Your veterinarian will examine your dog’s mouth as part of their complete physical exam. Once the epulis is identified, the next step is to surgically remove the growth using anesthesia.
"
"Most veterinarians require recent bloodwork before performing an anesthetized procedure for the safety of your dog. Often, removal of the epulis will be combined with a thorough cleaning of the teeth and gums as well as dental x-rays.
"
"These help the veterinarian determine how deep the mass goes, whether there are any other structures involved, and whether anything else needs to be addressed to keep your dog’s mouth healthy. Having this information about the mass helps the vet plan your dog’s oral surgery.
"
"Large masses or masses that could be cancerous may be biopsied before being removed. This is to gather more information about the growth to inform the best treatment approach.
"
"If your veterinarian is concerned that the mass may be cancer, she will recommend chest x-rays prior to anesthesia to make sure there are no detectable metastases (malignant growths in the lungs).
"
"The treatment for epulis in dogs is surgical removal, which is usually locally curative. This means that even though the entire growth is removed, other masses are not prevented from growing in the future.
"
"It is easier and safer to remove an epulis when it is small. In fact, the larger the tumor, the more likely it is to regrow after removal.
"
"Once the mass is removed, it will be sent to the veterinary pathologist for examination at the cellular level. The pathologist can determine which type of epulis your dog had and whether any follow-up treatment is required.
"
"Radiation therapy may reduce the likelihood of regrowth, especially in cases where complete removal was not possible.
"
"If an epulis has become very large, your regular veterinarian may not be able to remove it. She may refer you to a veterinary dentist, who is a board-certified specialist, for advanced options.
"
"Recovery from epulis removal typically only takes a few days. Your veterinarian will likely recommend feeding your dog soft or canned food during the recovery period, and they will send home pain medication to keep your dog comfortable.
"
"Antibiotics are not required after all procedures, but if your veterinarian recommends them, make sure to use them as directed and to give your dog all of the medication.
"
"Your dog may or may not have stitches in their mouth. If stitches are present, they will usually fall out on their own after 10-14 days.
"
"New epulides may form over time, either in the same or different locations in the mouth. Your veterinarian will monitor your dog’s oral health at every visit.
"
"See our Dog Surgery Aftercare FAQs for general info on caring for your dog after surgery.
"
"An epulis in a dog can look smooth or have a cobblestone appearance. It can grow in a mound or as a stalk, and is often the same color as the gums.
"
"An epulis is not painful unless there is difficulty with chewing, grooming, or playing with toys. If an epulis gets very large, that may also be painful.
"
"Yes, some types of epulides (plural of epulis) are considered cancerous. They usually don’t spread to other parts of the body but can weaken the jawbone or cause loose teeth.

"The first step is to confirm that the dog did in fact have a seizure. It is extremely helpful if the pet parent can video the episode and keep a log of any evidence of aura, a description of the seizure, how long the event lasted, and the length of the post-ictal phase (the dog will be disoriented and may even appear blind for only a few minutes, or up to several hours).
"
"Dogs who have a seizure for the first time should be seen immediately by a veterinarian.  A thorough history followed by physical examination and full neurologic examination will be done.  A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation to help rule out other causes, as well as chest X-rays and an abdominal ultrasound. 
"
"If the tests are negative, your veterinarian may be suspicious of epilepsy. Referral to a veterinary neurologist may be recommended, along with more advanced diagnostics such as bile acids, MRI, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. If all tests are negative, epilepsy may be diagnosed. 
"
"Epilepsy is a life-long condition which cannot be cured, but it can be managed. In most cases it will require daily medications for life. The right anti-epileptic medication for your dog may depend on several factors and will be determined by your veterinarian. 
"
"The four most prescribed medications include:
"
"levetiracetam (Keppra)
"
"phenobarbital
"
"potassium bromide
"
"zonisamide
"
"A combination of anti-seizure medications is typically prescribed for better control, including the use of gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica).
"
"The goal of treatment is to decrease the number of seizures. Keep in mind it’s typically not possible to eliminate them completely. Control is achieved if the dog is having less than one seizure every 3 months.
"
"The following includes EMERGENCY criteria. If your dog is experiencing any of these concerns, please take them to a veterinary emergency hospital immediately: 
"
"One seizure lasting more than 5 minutes
"
"Cluster seizures, which means one seizure rolls into another, causing repeated back-to-back seizures. This can be life-threatening.
"
"More than 3 seizures in a 24-hour period
"
"Epileptic patients can have emergency criteria at the beginning of their diagnosis and treatment, or can have breakthrough events while being treated. It is important to understand that seizures increase the likelihood of them happening more, so if your dog’s seizures are not well controlled, please follow up with your veterinarian.   
"
"Seeing your dog have a seizure is scary and can be very emotionally challenging—but you are not alone Many pet parents experience the same stress of not knowing what the future may hold for their dog’s health.
"
"Appropriate medications may allow most dogs with epilepsy to resume normal lives. Sticking to your dog’s medication schedule—by making sure medications are given on time and doses are not missed—is crucial to successfully managing epilepsy—along with your veterinarian.
"
"Periodic follow-up appointments may be necessary depending on the specific medication your dog has been prescribed. Some dogs may require medication adjustments over time if breakthrough seizures occur.
"
"Stress is the most reported trigger of seizures in epileptic pets. If you think you have identified a possible trigger, discuss it and any possible alternative options to avoid it with your veterinarian. 
"
"If an epulis is allowed to get very large, it can make eating difficult and cause disfigurement. Some cancerous masses such as amelanotic melanoma may look like an epulis, so never ignore a growth in your dog’s mouth.

"The term hepatomegaly is used to describe an abnormally enlarged liver. Often occurring due to certain diseases and conditions that can either directly or indirectly affect the functioning of the liver, the liver organ may increase in size, taking on a diseased condition of its own. 
"
"Puppies normally have larger livers in respect to their body mass as compared to adult dogs. However, hepatomegaly is most commonly diagnosed in older dogs. Depending on the underlying cause, the enlargement may involve the whole liver or only part of it. For example, infections and/or inflammation may lead to generalized symmetrical enlargement of the liver, whereas tumors, hemorrhages, cysts, or rotation of liver lobe may lead to asymmetrical or focal enlargement. That is, only a part of the liver may be enlarged.
"
"Symptoms can vary depending on the cause. Enlargement of the abdomen is the most commonly observed symptom. On examination your veterinarian will find an enlarged liver or a palpable mass in the abdominal area. The mass is usually observed behind the rib cage and may even be visible with naked eye. However, in obese dogs it is difficult to detect an enlarged liver on physical examination.
"
"You will need to give a detailed history of your dog's health, onset and nature of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all body systems, and a complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The results of the routine laboratory tests are highly variable depending on the underlying cause of the liver enlargement. The complete blood count may reveal anemia, abnormal spherical red blood cells (spherocytes), disrupted red blood cells (schistocytes), red blood cells with spots due to hemoglobin accumulation (Heinz bodies), presence of parasites with red blood cells, immature white blood cells (blast cells) in the blood, red blood cells with nucleus, and abnormally low or high number of platelets (tiny cells used in blood clotting). The biochemistry profile may show abnormally high levels of liver enzymes, and a high cholesterol level. Further testing may include blood clotting profile as blood clotting abnormalities are common in patients with liver involvement. Your dog may also be tested for presence of heartworm disease.
"
"The abdominal X-rays may show an enlarged liver with rounded margins, or a displaced stomach and kidneys. The chest X-rays may help in determining any metastasis of a tumor to the chest cavity, and will also show diseases involving the heart and lungs. Abdominal ultrasonography can be used to view further details in the abdominal cavity, revealing changes in liver size and surface contour, as well as the presence of concurrent disease. Abdominal ultrasound will also help in discriminating diffuse or localized types of liver enlargement. More advanced diagnostic tests, like electrocardiography and echocardiography, can be used to evaluate the structure and functions of heart.
"
"  
"
"If tumors are seen or suspected, your veterinarian will want to take a sample of liver tissue in order to confirm either its benign or malignant nature, but even without a tumor present, a tissue sample can be helpful for determining the cause, severity and stage of the liver disease. The samples will be sent to laboratory for microbial cultures, and in case of infection, the culturing of the sample will help in determining the type of microorganism that is involved so that suitable drugs can be prescribed. 
"
"
"
"Treatment is highly variable and will depend on the underlying cause. In case of heart involvement or advanced liver disease, your dog may need to be hospitalized for intensive treatment and supportive care. The aim of treatment is eliminate the inciting cause and prevent further complications. Broad spectrum antibiotics are given to the dogs with infections. Dehydration is common in these patients and intravenous fluids are required for normalizing the fluid levels. Multivitamins are also given to maintain the healthy levels of vitamins. In case of a tumor, abscess, or cyst, your dog may also require surgical interventions to remove these growths.
"
"Patients with heart failure or excessive fluid in the abdomen require changes in feed and fluid intake. These patients need special care and often complete cage rest is recommended. Special diet considerations, like addition of high levels of proteins, restriction of salt, and adequate vitamin supplementation will be put in place for your dog.
"
"The prognosis is variable and depends on the underlying cause and duration of the disease. Some causes are less serious, while others are life-threatening in nature. As the liver is the central organ in the metabolism of drugs, you must not give any drug or change the dosage amount of any prescribed drugs without prior consultation with your veterinarian. In order to prevent negative energy balance, you will need to feed small and frequent meals to your dog. Your dog will need to be evaluated frequently during therapy, with laboratory testing and radiography conducted as necessary to monitor your dog's progress.

"Entropion is when a dog’s eyelid grows inward so their eyelashes rub against their cornea (clear part of the eye covering the iris). It is the most common eyelid abnormality in dogs. Entropion may affect any part of the lower eyelid, upper eyelid, or both.
"
"Entropion in dogs can develop as a primary disease that’s genetically inherited at birth or as a secondary disease affecting dogs at any point of their lives.
"
"The main symptom of entropion is an inverted eyelid (turned inward) that causes eye irritation.
"
"Additional symptoms include:
"
"Excessive tear production and staining    
"
"Eye discharge (pus/mucus)
"
"Eye redness (conjunctival hyperemia)
"
"Keeping the eye closed
"
"Entropion is caused by an eyelid that has an abnormal shape in relation to the eyeball.
"
"The factors that lead to entropion in dogs include:     
"
"Length of eyelid
"
"Shape of skull
"
"Shape of the bone cavity that contains the eyeball
"
"Gender
"
"Extensive skin folds and wrinkles around the eyes
"
"Entropion in dogs can be primary, or present at birth, or secondary, meaning it was caused by something else.
"
"Primary entropion is the most common lid disease in purebred dogs. It is thought to be due to a hereditary defect, but the genetic basis is not well understood.
"
"The most common breeds predisposed to entropion are:
"
"Boxer
"
"Bloodhound
"
"Bull Mastiff
"
"Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
"
"Chesapeake Bay Retriever
"
"Chow Chow
"
"Cocker Spaniel
"
"Doberman Pinscher
"
"English Bulldog
"
"Golden Retriever
"
"Great Dane
"
"Irish Setter
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"Poodle
"
"Pug
"
"Shar Pei
"
"Springer Spaniel
"
"Rottweiler
"
"Saint Bernard
"
"Secondary causes of entropion in dogs include:
"
"Trauma or inflammation from eye injuries
"
"Eyelid scarring or nerve damage
"
"Infectious disease
"
"Veterinarians perform an ophthalmologic examination of your dog’s eyes and eyelids in order to diagnose entropion. Your dog will be awake and not sedated for evaluation, as this allows your vet to observe your dog’s normal eye shape.
"
"Entropion requires surgery to be treated. The surgery involves removing the extra skin surrounding the eyelids to tighten them back to a normal anatomical position.
"
"In growing puppies under 12 weeks of age, eyelid-tacking procedures are typically performed instead of the normal surgery to treat entropion.
"
"With eyelid tacking, the skin surrounding the eye is not removed the way it is with a normal entropion surgical procedure. Instead, the excess skin surrounding the eye is temporarily turned outward with tension sutures. This is so a puppy’s facial features can fully develop without the risk of malformations due to surgical removal of the developing eyelid muscle or tissue.
"
"Surgical complications from entropion surgery include:
"
"Under correction, which occurs if not enough eyelid skin has been removed to correct the eyelid from rubbing the cornea
"
"Overcorrection, which occurs if too much eyelid skin is removed, preventing the eyelids from closing normally
"
"Take heart that these complications are rare, and surgical correction is the best treatment choice for entropion. The prognosis for animals after entropion surgery is excellent because it restores their comfort and vision.
"
"Recovery from entropion surgery is rapid. Your dog’s eyes will be swollen from surgery and will be the most swollen around 24 hours after surgery. The swelling can take 2-4 weeks to completely go away. Your dog will need to wear an Elizabethan collar after surgery to protect the sutures around their eyes.
"
"Your vet might prescribe topical eye medications depending on whether your dog has underlying corneal disease. They might also prescribe oral antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and analgesics.    
"
"You will need to go back to the vet so they can remove the sutures 14 days after surgery, and the Elizabethan collar can be removed a few days after that.
"
"One thing you need to watch out for is keeping your dog from injuring the incision site, which usually happens if your dog is able to remove the Elizabethan collar or if you’ve taken it off your dog too soon after the surgical procedure.
"
"No, dogs cannot outgrow entropion. If the condition is left without corrective surgery, it can cause further eye diseases, such as corneal ulcers, conjunctivitis, and chronic eye discharge. The entropion itself can even worsen over time in breeds that develop more skin folds around their face as they age.
"
"Yes, entropion is painful to dogs. It causes discomfort due to the constant irritation of the cornea resulting in eye damage and vision loss. 
"
"Typical surgery for entropion costs $500-$1000 per eye. A general veterinary practitioner that is familiar with entropion surgery will be able to perform the procedure for less money than a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist.

"Hyperkalemia is expressed by markedly higher than normal concentrations of potassium in the blood. Normally eliminated in the kidneys, potassium and its increased acidity in the dog's blood can have a direct impact on the heart's ability to function normally, making this a high priority condition. Elimination is enhanced by aldosterone, a hormone that causes the tubules of the kidneys to retain sodium and water. Therefore, conditions that can inhibit renal elimination of potassium can be a direct cause of hyperkalemia.
"
"Meanwhile, pseudohyperkalemia -- which is characterized by a rise in the amount of potassium due to excessive leakage of potassium from the cells, and which takes place during or after blood is drawn -- is not uncommon in the Akita breed.
"
"Pseudohyperkalemia, false hyperkalemia, is a finding which occurs when a sample of blood that has been taken is not analyzed or separated promptly. Because some blood cells contain high concentrations of potassium, this intracellular potassium is released into the blood serum, causing the potassium concentration to appear to be artificially high. Another cause, low potassium elimination from the body, may be related to anuric (absence or defective excretion of urine) or oliguric (scanty urine production, renal failure) conditions. Also contributing are physical traumas such as urinary tract rupture or urethral obstruction, and some gastrointestinal diseases.
"
"Additional causes include:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected secondarily. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.
"
"Hyperkalemia is often characterized by an intermittent history of gastrointestinal complaints, weakness, and collapse. Your veterinarian will check for hypoadrenocorticism (an endocrine disorder). If your dog is straining to urinate or is experiencing low urine output, he or she will consider urinary obstruction or oliguric/anuric kidney failure.
"
"Diagnostic imaging will include radiographic contrast studies, which uses an injection of a radiopaque/radiocontrasting agent into the space to be viewed in order to improve visibility on X-ray. Ultrasound can also be used to rule out urinary tract rupture or obstruction of the urinary tract.
"
"Because hyperkalemia can affect the blood's ability to flow normally, further affecting the heart's ability to function at full capacity, an electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording will be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat).
"
"
"
"Treatment varies according to the underlying cause. Supportive measures will first focus on the symptoms, lowering potassium levels to normal blood levels, while pursuing a definitive diagnosis. Saline, given at 0.9 percent, is the fluid of choice for lowering potassium concentrations and blunting the effects of hyperkalemia on cardiac conduction.
"
"If the dog is dehydrated or hypotensive (abnormally low blood pressure), fluids can be administered rapidly. Medications will be prescribed as appropriate by your veterinarian.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up exams to recheck potassium levels, which should be relative to the frequency dictated by the underlying disease. Your doctor will repeat ECG checks frequently until any rhythm disturbances are resolved.

"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the most common heart diseases in large-breed dogs. With DCM, the dog’s heart becomes enlarged as the heart muscle weakens­­­–becoming thinner and stretched out.
"
"The heart has four chambers arranged in a square. The two top chambers are the left and right atrium, while the two bottom chambers are the left and right ventricles. Blood travels from the body into the right side of the heart, where it then moves into the lungs through the pulmonary arteries. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen that it brings back into the left side of the heart before being pumped back to the rest of the body. This process allows the body’s cells to receive oxygen essential for life functions.
"
"The oxygenated blood fuels dogs’ muscles in their legs, allowing them to run, jump, and play. It feeds their intestinal tract to help with digestion of food and absorption of nutrients. It fuels the kidneys and the liver so that they can remove toxins and waste products from the blood. Every  organ in a dog’s body needs the oxygenated blood that the heart pumps out. In dogs that have DCM, their ventricles start to wear down and become thin and weak. This makes it more difficult for them to pump that enriched blood back out to the body.
"
"While DCM develops slowly over time, it is often subtle and goes unnoticed by pet parents Dogs may develop heart failure suddenly and require emergency care. DCM may also progress to congestive heart failure (CHF), which is considered a medical emergency because it can be fatal in a matter of hours.
"
" 
"
"DCM can come on abruptly–a seemingly normal dog may show serious clinical signs or even suddenly die. These signs can come from a lack of oxygenated blood going out to the body, resulting in fatigue or poor appetite, or they can be a result of fluid backing up from the heart into the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.
"
"Symptoms for DCM include:
"
"Rapid breathing
"
"Difficulty lying down or getting comfortable, restlessness
"
"Blue tinge to gums or tongue
"
"Wet cough or hack
"
"Increased effort while breathing, chest heaving
"
"Tiring easily, intolerance to exercise
"
"Lethargy or weakness
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Distended (swollen) belly
"
"Fainting or collapse
"
"Dilated cardiomyopathy can be caused by several factors, including genetics, nutrition, and infections. It has long been linked in part to genetics because several breeds are more likely to be affected.
"
"DCM occurs typically in large-breed dogs, most commonly:
"
"Doberman Pinschers
"
"Irish Wolfhounds
"
"Boxers
"
"Saint Bernards
"
"Newfoundlands
"
"While DCM is more common in large-breed dogs, English Springer Spaniels, Cocker Spaniels, and Portuguese Water Dogs also have an inherited trait that can predispose them to the condition.
"
"In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine began investigating the link between grain-free diets and dilated cardiomyopathy. This came after some veterinary cardiologists saw higher numbers of cases of DCM in dogs that were not genetically affected breeds, such as Golden Retrievers.
"
" In 2019, the FDA released a report stating that more than 90% of DCM cases reported to the FDA were dogs who were fed grain-free diets. Many of these diets contained peas and other legumes or lentils as main ingredients, in place of traditional grains. Some of the implicated diets were raw food, vegetarian, or vegan diets.
"
"This began the discussion of “BEG” diets in the veterinary community, an acronym for boutique, exotic, and grain-free diets. Initially, it was believed that the issue was related to a potential deficiency of taurine, an essential nutrient, in these diets. This came from released reports that many Golden Retrievers seemed to respond well to taurine supplementation in treating their DCM. Since then, it has been found that DCM may be more complicated than just one ingredient, and many factors  can play a role in causing it.
"
"Many veterinarians advise against feeding grain-free diets; however, some dogs with allergies may be recommended for specific BEG diets to manage their disease. It is important to talk to your veterinarian about good nutrition and what is best for your pet’s health and wellness. They may recommend that you see a veterinary nutritionist to come up with a unique diet tailored to your pet’s needs.
"
"If you are feeding a BEG, vegetarian/vegan, raw, or homemade diet, talk to your veterinarian about recommended monitoring to avoid secondary acquired nutritional disease, like DCM. Your veterinarian may recommend measuring blood and plasma taurine levels, supplements with specific vitamins or minerals, or more frequent imaging to ensure that no problems are developing because of your dog’s diet.
"
"DCM is diagnosed by a combination of tests. Your veterinarian will start by listening to your dog’s heart for the presence of a murmur or arrhythmia (abnormal rhythm). They will also listen for any dampened (muffled) lung sounds or crackles that may show fluid buildup in the lungs. They will take x-rays to look at the size of the heart and check for any enlargement or fluid.
"
"Additionally, they may run bloodwork and look at urine to screen for underlying kidney disease, as many patients have heart and kidney disease at the same time. They may also run a ProBNP test, which looks for high amounts of a specific protein that goes along with stretching or damage to the heart muscle.
"
"If DCM is diagnosed or suspected, your veterinarian may recommend referral to a veterinary cardiologist. The cardiologist can do a heart ultrasound , called an echocardiogram. This allows them to look at each chamber of the heart and to watch the blood flow through the heart. They will also do an ECG, or electrocardiogram, to look at electrical current in the heart to diagnose any abnormal rhythms.
"
"DCM is most often treated with medications that help to decrease the workload of the heart or improve the efficiency of the heart’s work, and to remove any fluid from the lungs to make breathing easier.
"
"This disease is managed rather than cured. While there is no cure for DCM, dogs that have nutritionally acquired DCM that is caught early can restore normal heart function with the right therapy. The most common medications prescribed in patients with DCM and congestive heart failure include:
"
"ACE inhibitors, like enalapril or benazepril, which work to expand the veins leaving the heart and reduce resistance so that it is easier for the heart to pump blood back out to the body.
"
"Diuretics, like furosemide or spironolactone, which help to remove fluid from the lungs to make breathing easier for dogs with congestive heart disease.
"
"Inotropic drugs, which change the force of the heart’s contractions. Medication like pimobendan is commonly prescribed and works to improve heart muscle strength. Pimobendan helps to increase the strength of heart muscle contractions and lower the pressure in the arteries and veins.
"
"Beta blockers act as anti-arrhythmic drugs. More commonly prescribed beta blockers include sotalol, atenolol, and carvedilol. Calcium channel blockers like diltiazem may also be prescribed. A cardiologist may prescribe any of these medications if irregular heart rhythms are diagnosed. These drugs work by acting on the heart’s electrical channels.
"
"Nutritional therapy may be needed in the management of heart disease. Sodium-restricted diets may be helpful, like Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Cardiac or Hills Prescription Diet h/d. Additionally, taurine, coenzyme Q10, or carnitine supplements may be recommended.
"
"Bronchodilators, like theophylline, and cough suppressants, like hydrocodone or butorphanol, may be prescribed to make breathing easier and reduce cough frequency associated with congestive heart failure.
"
"Management of DCM is lifelong in dogs. Heart disease is progressive over time, and there are many factors that can change the prognosis, including: your dog’s breed, if the disease is related to nutrition, and how severe the disease is at the time of diagnosis.
"
"Some breeds, like Doberman Pinschers, have more aggressive forms of this disease, with an average survival time of three months after diagnosis. Other breeds, like Cocker Spaniels, more commonly have a slower progression of DCM, living an average of 6 months to two years after time of diagnosis.
"
"If a taurine deficiency is found and adjusted, the heart’s function can improve quite a bit. But if your dog is already in congestive heart failure at the time of diagnosis, this may make their prognosis worse. Dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy caught early in the disease process may have a better prognosis and live comfortable lives for years.

"In patients that are being treated with insulin for diabetic ketoacidosis (a condition in which the body burns fatty acids and produces acidic ketone bodies in response to insulin shortage) or are undergoing refeeding with glycolysis (synthesized glucose) for treatment of starvation, a resulting rapid production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, a nucleotide that transports chemical energy within cells) can lead to relocation of phosphorus from the blood serum into cells. The resulting low concentration of phosphorus that is caused by shifts of phosphorus from the extracellular fluid (the fluid outside of the cells) into the body cells can lead to reduced intestinal absorption of phosphorus, or reduced renal (kidney) phosphorus reabsorption.
"
"If left undiagnosed, it can further lead to acute extracellular hypophosphatemia (an electrolyte disturbance).
"
"Because phosphorus is an important component of ATP, low serum phosphorus concentration can cause ATP depletion and affect cells with high ATP-energy demands, such as red blood cells, skeletal muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells, and brain cells. A state of hypophosphatemia can also lead to a reduction in erythrocyte 2,3-DPG, resulting in decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
"
"Symptoms are generally consistent with the primary disease that is responsible for the hypophosphatemia, rather than any that would be related to the phosphate concentration itself.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms  that you have provided, and possible conditions that might have led to this condition. Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis to determine the priority for treatment. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.
"
"
"
"If your dog is suffering from severe hypophosphatemia, your veterinarian will need to hospitalize the dog for immediate treatment. If the condition is caused by insulin therapy or intravenous nutrients and vitamins, these treatments will be suspended until supplemental phosphate has been administered for a few hours. If a condition of anemia is present, fresh whole blood transfusions may be required. Conversely, if your dog is only suffering a moderate case of hypophosphatemia, it may be treated on an outpatient basis as long as its condition is stable.
"
"Your veterinarian will need to measure your dog's phosphorus levels every 6–12 hours until the concentration of phosphorous remains stable within the normal range. If hyperphosphatemia recurs, all supplementation will be stopped and your dog will be provided with intravenous fluid until the phosphorus levels return to normal. Follow-up care will include monitoring your dog's condition for acute (sudden and severe) renal failure, a condition that some hyperphosphatemic patients become more prone to, and monitoring potassium concentrations daily until they, too, are remaining stable.

"EPI stands for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. EPI in dogs is a health issue that has serious effects on the pancreas. It happens when most of the cells that produce digestive hormones don’t function normally.
"
"The pancreas is a small organ located under a dog’s stomach, next to the beginning of the small intestine (the duodenum). The pancreas has two vital functions:
"
"Producing insulin, the hormone that moves sugar from the bloodstream into cells.
"
"Producing digestive hormones, including lipase to break down fat, proteases to break down protein, and amylase to break down starch.
"
"Different cells within a dog’s pancreas are responsible for performing each of these functions. When enough insulin-producing cells are damaged, dogs develop Type I diabetes. And when the cells that produce digestive hormones aren’t working, the result is EPI in dogs.
"
"Unfortunately, there’s no cure for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in dogs. Once the pancreas is damaged to the point that symptoms of EPI develop, you will need to give your dog pancreatic enzyme supplements and possibly other treatments for the rest of their life. However, with proper management, your dog can live a healthy and happy life.
"
"Without adequate digestive hormones, the food that a dog eats can’t be broken down and absorbed.
"
"Hyperandrogenism in dogs is a rare syndrome characterized by elevations of masculinizing sex hormones such as testosterone and its derivatives in the blood serum. It is most frequently documented in intact male dogs.
"
"In males, androgens are produced by the interstitial cells (cells in the small spaces between tissue) of the testes and are responsible for normal male sexual development. Androgens promote masculine behavior and physical development, such as spermatogenesis – the formation of sperm. Androgens include the steroid hormones testosterone, androsterone, and dihydrotestosterone, which is a derivative of testosterone and a biologically-active metabolite (substance essential to the metabolic process).
"
"Dihydrotestosterone is formed primarily in the prostate gland, testes, hair follicles, and adrenal glands. Androgens are also produced by the adrenal cortex (situated along the perimeter of the adrenal gland near the kidneys), and by the ovaries in females.
"
"Hyperandrogenism may occur as a result of excessive hormone production by the testes, ovaries, or the adrenal cortex. The latter may occur secondary to dysfunctional enzyme activity. Hyperandrogenism may also occur in association with the administration of synthetic androgens.
"
"Hyperandrogenism may be symptomized by behavioral changes, abnormalities of the reproductive tract, and skin problems. This disorder tends to occur in Pomeranians, Chow Chows, Poodles, Keeshond, and Samoyeds.
"
"Female
"
"Male
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis, in order to rule out an underlying metabolic cause for the disease, such as hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, or hyperestrogenism. A complete neurologic exam will also be performed if your dog is behaving abnormally. You will need to be prepared to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and any genetic background that you are familiar with, in case there is a genetic link. It will also help if you know the health status of your dog's maternal parent, during and after pregnancy, in case the disorder was acquired before birth.
"
"As a result, dogs with EPI typically lose weight. Your dog may also:
"
"Have a ravenous appetite
"
"Eat feces (coprophagia)
"
"Eat other unusual things (pica)
"
"Have soft stool or diarrhea that is pale, greasy, and/or especially smelly—this is due to the presence of undigested food within the intestinal tract
"
"Have excess gas
"
"Have flaky skin and a rough coat
"
"Other symptoms may be present in severe cases or if a dog is suffering from another condition in addition to EPI.
"
"The most common cause of EPI in dogs is pancreatic acinar atrophy (PAA). This is especially true when EPI is diagnosed in a relatively young dog less than four years old.1
"
"PAA appears to be an autoimmune disease, meaning that a dog’s own immune system attacks and destroys the pancreatic cells responsible for producing digestive enzymes. The primary risk factor for PAA in dogs is genetic, which is why EPI is seen more frequently in certain breeds of dogs.
"
"German Shepherd dogs are most at risk, but studies have shown that these breeds also have an increased incidence of EPI 1,2,3:
"
"Rough-Coated Collies
"
"Chow Chows
"
"Cavalier King Charles Spaniels
"
"Cairn Terriers
"
"Akitas
"
"West Highland White Terriers
"
"Cardigan Welsh Corgis
"
"Border Collies
"
"Australian Heelers
"
"Australian Shepherds
"
"Shetland Sheepdogs
"
"However, any dog can develop EPI, and not all cases of EPI are linked to genetics. Diseases that destroy large parts of the pancreas, like pancreatic cancer or severe and/or chronic pancreatitis4, or other more rare conditions may also be to blame.
"
"A veterinarian may suspect that a dog has EPI based solely on their symptoms and breed or history of health problems, but lab tests are still necessary because other diseases can have similar clinical signs. Here are several tests that can help diagnose EPI in dogs.
"
"Other tests for EPI are available but don’t provide results that are as reliable as the TLI test. However, they may be appropriate under some circumstances.
"
"Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiencies, are common in dogs with EPI. Folate (another type of B vitamin) levels can be normal, high, or low.
"
"In severe cases of EPI, dogs may become deficient in vitamin K, which can lead to bleeding. Your veterinarian will measure your dog’s cobalamin, folate, and possibly some other vitamin levels to determine which supplements are necessary to return your dog to good health.
"
"In theory, treatment for EPI in dogs is fairly straightforward: Dogs eat the missing pancreatic digestive enzymes with their meals, and any other abnormalities, like low cobalamin levels, are addressed.
"
"Abdominal radiography or ultrasound imaging can be used to visualize the interior space of the abdomen for masses or gonadal tissue, both of which may be a leading cause for hyperandrogenism.
"
"In addition, there are several tests that may be used to make a conclusive diagnosis: A karyotype, or chromosome analysis, may be used to detect intersex/gonadal sex abnormalities; serum samples will be taken for evaluation of sex hormones; growth hormone stimulation test; serum testosterone concentration test; an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test to measure the adrenal response to ACTH (which is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland); and a test of the cortisol-creatinine ratio in the urine to rule out hyperadrenocorticism. Results may be variable.
"
"
"
"Surgical neutering of intact animals is recommended, and surgical excision of any testosterone-secreting masses or neoplastic (abnormal) tissue should be performed. Controlled destruction of the adrenal gland can also be undertaken. Growth hormones may be administered, but the treatment will depend on the particular underlying cause of your dog's hyperandrogenism.
"
"After the initial treatment has brought your dog's condition under control, your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments in order to follow the progress and to treat any further complications or underlying disorders. Your veterinarian may repeat the ACTH stimulation tests and blood tests to verify serum testosterone if it was initially high, along with standard physical exams to assure that your dog is recovering from the effects of the hyperandrogenism.

"
"Unfortunately, the reality of treating EPI can be a bit more complicated.
"
"You should add pancreatic enzymes to your dog’s food for every meal. Powdered pancreatic enzyme supplements like VET One® PancrePlus Powder for dogs and cats and PanaKare™ Plus Powder for dogs and cats are easy to use and usually effective.
"
"Tablets are also available, but they don’t seem to work as well as the powders.
"
"Tips for Administering Pancreatic Enzyme Powders to Your Dog
"
"Mix the powder thoroughly into your dog’s food before you give it to your dog because it can irritate their mouth.
"
"Some pet parents report that letting the food sit for little while to allow “predigestion” improves their dog’s response to treatment. Research doesn’t seem to back this up, but it doesn’t hurt to try if your dog’s condition isn’t improving as well as expected.
"
"Follow the dosage instructions on the label or provided by your veterinarian, but once your dog’s symptoms are well-controlled, the goal is often to find the smallest amount of the enzyme supplement that works for your dog.
"
"Another source of pancreatic enzymes is raw pancreas meat from other animals.
"
"You can purchase the organ meat from butchers, raw pet food suppliers, and other sources, but handling and feeding raw animal products increases the risk of food-borne illnesses like salmonellosis for everyone in the house.
"
"A commonly recommended starting dose for pancreas meat is 1-3 ounces mixed with each meal, but follow your veterinarian’s recommendation. The amount your dog needs will be based on the specifics of your dog’s case.
"
"You can grind up and freeze pancreas meat in the appropriate portions and then thaw it before mixing it thoroughly with each meal.
"
"Whether they are delivered in powder form or with pancreas meat, most pancreatic enzymes are broken down in a dog’s stomach. Medication that decreases stomach acid secretion, like omeprazole, may be used if this is a concern.
"
"Dogs who have low blood levels of vitamin B12, folate, and/or other vitamins need supplementation. Initially, vitamin B12 shots are superior to oral administration, but once your dog’s condition is stable, you can usually switch to an oral cobalamin supplement.
"
"Some dogs with EPI develop an overgrowth of bacteria in their intestinal tract, which can be managed with antibiotics (often Tylosin). Many dogs only require antibiotic treatment for a month or two as their condition improves, but some may benefit from long-term treatment.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend other treatments based on a dog’s symptoms and additional health concerns.
"
"After proper treatment is started, most dogs with EPI quickly start to feel better. Their symptoms can improve over the course of a few days to weeks.
"
"If that’s not the case, and your dog’s symptoms aren’t improving, discuss other treatment options with your veterinarian. Ask if switching to a different diet makes sense.
"
"There is no one type of diet that benefits all (or even most) dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
"
"Some dogs seem to do better when switched to a highly digestible food that is relatively low in fat and fiber, while others improve with more fiber or fat, or they do just fine with whatever it is that they normally eat.5
"
"If your dog continues to respond poorly to treatment, it’s possible that they could be suffering from more than one health problem, and additional diagnostic testing may be necessary.
"
"Pancreatic acinar atrophy (PAA) is the most common cause of EPI in dogs. PAA is primarily a genetic disease that leads to a dog’s immune system destroying the cells in the pancreas that make digestive enzymes.
"
"A common recommendation is to feed dogs a highly digestible dog food that is relatively low in fat and fiber. However, different types of food seem to work better for different dogs, so you may have to try several diets before finding a good fit.
"
"Your veterinarian can help you figure out the best food for your dog.
"
"The best test for EPI in dogs is the trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) test, which involves taking a blood sample after a dog hasn’t eaten for 8-12 hours.
"
"The cost of a TLI test varies but is usually around $100. Other tests will be necessary to plan appropriate treatment.
"
"You can’t treat dog EPI at home without going to the vet first.
"
"Treatment of your dog’s EPI will require a veterinary visit and you will need to go through a process of finding the right balance of supplements and medication. However, once that balance is found, the management of EPI in dogs at home is fairly straightforward.
"
"Dogs with EPI are usually managed at home with pancreatic enzyme supplementation and cobalamin supplementation. Some dogs also require additional vitamin supplements, antibiotics, medications to reduce the secretion of stomach acid, and other treatments to manage their symptoms.

"The canine elbow is a complex articulating joint made up of three bones: the humerus, the radius, and the ulna. These bones work together to allow a dog to bend, run, and play.
"
"Elbow dysplasia is a condition related to abnormal bone growth and/or development that alters the function of this joint, leading to abnormal weight distribution, pain, and arthritis—which most certainly affect a dog’s ability to bend, run, and play. Elbow dysplasia is seen more often in younger, large-breed dogs. 
"
" 
"
"Typically, elbow dysplasia is diagnosed as having four lesions, involving different parts of the joint:
"
" 
"
"Dogs are typically not screened for elbow dysplasia, unless it is known to have occurred in the dog’s bloodline, or the breed is predisposed. Most signs are fairly noticeable to the pet parent and the veterinarian, but some can be subtle, making the condition hard to diagnose. Dogs most often experience:
"
"Lameness or limping in one or both forelimbs, sometimes seen with a head bob. Most dogs will still be able to bear weight on the limb
"
"Swollen elbow
"
"Thickened joint
"
"Decreased range of motion
"
"Pain on manipulation of the joint
"
"Elbow bulges out toward the side
"
"Abnormal gait
"
"Hesitant to run or play as before
"
"Elbow dysplasia is thought to be an inherited condition, but it has also been associated with:
"
"Prior trauma
"
"Nutritional imbalances or deficiencies
"
"Defects in cartilage growth or bone development
"
"Hormonal factors
"
"Certain large-dog breeds are predisposed to the condition, which more often affects both elbows rather than one. These include:
"
"Bernese Mountain Dogs
"
"Labrador Retrievers
"
"German Shepherds
"
"Rottweilers
"
"Newfoundlands
"
"Mastiffs
"
"A physical exam will help localize the source of pain and discomfort to the elbow before x-rays will be taken of the limb. Sometimes, in order to obtain more accurate diagnostic images, your dog may need to be sedated or anesthetized. X-rays are almost always taken of the opposite limb as well for comparison purposes and to determine if disease is present in that elbow as well.
"
"If the signs cannot be determined on x-rays, a CT scan or arthroscopy (scoping, using a camera called an arthroscope, to take images of the elbow joint) may be ordered. In some cases, treatment of the condition can also occur during the arthroscopic procedure.
"
"The goal of any treatment for elbow dysplasia is to slow the progression of arthritis and allow the dog to use the elbow properly. Surgery is by far the most recommended course of treatment, not only to remove any diseased or damaged tissue but also to return functional ability to the joint. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible in order to prevent further joint trauma.
"
"It is important to note, however, that even with surgery, some degree of arthritis will develop. Because most surgeries are aimed at removing the part that is causing the dysplasia, the joint will be missing vital structures and won’t fit perfectly together.
"
"Given the technical prowess needed for repair, arthroscopic surgery is often preferred, as it is minimally invasive. This is usually performed by a veterinary orthopedic surgeon. 
"
"Dogs that are not candidates for surgery are treated supportively with:
"
"Medications aimed at decreasing pain and inflammation, such as NSAIDs like Rimadyl®, Galliprant®, and meloxicam
"
"Joint supplements containing glucosamine and chondroitin, which help decrease inflammation, promote healing, and retain water, giving the joint more cushioning (similar to WD-40 for gears)
"
"Weight management, as any additional weight is that much more problematic for the joint
"
"Adequan®, an injectable medication that inhibits cartilage loss, to help restore joint lubrication and relieve inflammation
"
"Cost and the ability to properly care for your dog post-op and throughout the rehabilitation process should be strong considerations in determining the best course of treatment for your dog. Of course, this should be a conversation you have with your veterinarian, but most surgeries cost $1,500-$4,000 per elbow, depending on your region.
"
"The prognosis for elbow dysplasia in dogs is good long-term, especially if degeneration is minimal or not apparent. The recovery period is often several weeks followed by several more of physical therapy and rehabilitation. It’s important to follow through, as this will often lead your dog to a faster recovery and better outcome than surgery alone.
"
"Rehabilitation with passive range-of-motion exercises, massage, acupuncture, or even physical therapy will be recommended and should be pursued in order to provide the best return to function as soon as possible. Additionally, exercise restriction will be important long-term, along with minimizing the impact of running, especially on hard flooring. 
"
"Dogs that cannot undergo surgery for one reason or another can live a long time with the condition. However, degenerative changes will develop over time, along with osteoarthritis, and your dog will suffer chronic pain. As such, medications like those mentioned above may be prescribed, along with joint supplements and diets.
"
"Because the condition is thought to have a genetic component, any pets with elbow dysplasia should be spayed or neutered to keep them from passing on the condition. Also, the parents shouldn’t be bred again.
"
"Minimizing trauma or additional stress to the joints—by, for example, keeping your dog from jumping down from furniture or going up and down stairs—may be helpful, as well as maintaining a healthy weight. Screening your puppy for this condition with x-rays would be advisable if your puppy is a breed susceptible to the condition.
"
"Unfortunately, elbow dysplasia cannot be cured. But it can be well managed. Surgery and medications can give your dog a relatively good quality of life. Playing fetch is not out of the question!
"
"Dogs with minimal arthritis at the time of diagnosis have a much more favorable prognosis than those that have significant arthritis. Fortunately, with surgical therapy, and even with medical management to an extent, dogs with elbow dysplasia can go on to live a fairly healthy life.

"Gingival hyperplasia refers to a medical conditon in which a dog's gum (gingival) tissue becomes inflamed and enlarged. Enlargement is typically caused by irritation due to dental plaque or other bacterial growth along the gum line. In many cases, this can be prevented with good oral hygiene habits. This enlargement is typical in dogs, and while it can occur in any breed, Boxers, Great Danes, Collies, Doberman Pinschers, and Dalmatians appear to be especially prone to developing an inflammation of the gums.
"
"The most common cause of gum enlargement (gingival hyperplasia) is bacteria and plaque along the gum line. If left untreated this disease can also affect the bones and structures supporting the teeth (periodontal disease).
"
"This medical condition is often diagnosed during a routine inspection of the dog's mouth. If there is a mass present, a biopsy of tissue taken from the mass will likely be performed to rule out or confirm the presence of cancer (neoplasia). X-ray images may also be taken to rule out the presence of other potentially serious underlying medical conditions.
"
"
"
"For serious cases, surgical repair and/or deep cleaning, with re-contouring of your dog's gums may be performed to help return the gum line to its original shape and to return any formed pockets to normal so that food and bacteria will no longer be problematic. Pain medication can be given as needed to reduce your dog's discomfort during the recovery process. Overall, a dental cleaning, along with oral antibiotics (antimicrobials), should be sufficient for cleaning your dog's mouth and for reducing the swelling and enlargement of the gums.
"
"It is important that you take your dog for complete routine dental cleanings with your veterinarin, and to maintain good oral hygiene and diet to prevent the formation or recurrence of enlarged gums. Animals with gingival hyperplasia generally will have a good outcome with treatment, although relapse is common. There are some potential complications with gum enlargement, including deeper pocket formation in the gums, which can encourage additional bacterial growth within the pockets.

"Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne (transmitted by tick bites) disease caused by infectious bacteria from the Ehrlichia genus. There are many species of Ehrlichia, but the two most common species responsible for ehrlichiosis in dogs in the United States are E. canis and E. ewingii. While all are transmitted by tick bites, the specific tick may vary depending on the specific species of Ehrlichia. Similarly, the Ehrlichia bacteria infect and live in white blood cells but the specific type of white blood cell will vary.
"
"E. canis was first identified during the Vietnam war and is sometimes called tracker dog disease or tropical canine pancytopenia. German Shepherds, Doberman Pinschers, Belgium Malinois, and Siberian Huskies appear to get a more severe form of this disease compared to other dogs. Often, when veterinarians refer to ehrlichiosis they are referring to an E. canis infection (scientifically called Canine Monocytic Ehrlichiosis). Once E. canis enters the host, it lives within white blood cells called monocytes. 
"
"E. ewingii is the most common form of ehrlichiosis in North America, and once it enters the host, it lives in a different white blood cell called the granulocyte. Less attention is paid to E. ewingii infection (scientifically called canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis) because it is generally not as serious as E. canis infections. Most dogs with E. ewingii are only mildly ill or may show no signs of illness. 
"
"Geographically, ehrlichiosis is most frequently reported in the southeastern and south-central United States with the highest prevalence in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. 
"
"The clinical signs of E. canis can be divided into three phases: acute, subclinical, and chronic.
"
"The acute phase (early disease) occurs one to three weeks after the tick bite occurs. During this time, the E. canis bacteria is reproducing and attaching to white blood cells. The clinical signs typically seen in the acute phase are:
"
"Fever 
"
"Lethargy/depression 
"
"Anorexia/weight loss
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes 
"
"Lameness
"
"Vomiting/diarrhea
"
"Cough 
"
"Abnormal bruising and bleeding
"
"Neurologic signs, such as loss of balance or stumbling
"
"If treated in the acute phase, most dogs will clear the infection completely and return to normal. Dogs that do not receive treatment will likely progress to the subclinical phase in weeks one to four.
"
"In the subclinical phase, dogs will still be infected but show no signs of disease. The bacteria hide in the spleen where it can remain for months or years. The dog will have no clinical signs but may have some changes on bloodwork (a slightly low platelet count and possibly elevated blood protein called the globulin). Not all dogs will progress from the subclinical to the chronic phase as some dogs may clear the disease on their own.
"
"In the chronic phase (long-term disease), the dogs were unable to eliminate the bacteria and will become sick again. Chronic phase clinical signs include:
"
"Abnormal bleeding: Up to 60 percent of chronic phase dogs will have this symptom due to decreased platelet numbers which can lead to anemia.
"
"Inflammation in the eyes (uveitis), bleeding in the eye (hyphema), or blindness
"
"Neurologic signs, such as loss of balance or stumbling
"
"Increased urinating (polyuria) and increased drinking (polydipsia) from damage to kidneys
"
"Lameness/swollen limbs
"
"Dogs in the chronic phase have a worse prognosis, and this phase can become fatal.
"
"Clinical signs of E. ewingii are milder than E. canis and can include fever and swollen joints. Some dogs with E. ewingii do not show any clinical signs at all.
"
"E. canis is transmitted by the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). E. ewingii is transmitted by the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum). Disease transmission can occur in as little as three to six hours after the tick attaches, therefore prompt tick removal is crucial.
"
"Humans cannot get E. canis but they are susceptible to other types of ehrlichiosis, including E. ewingii. However, ehrlichiosis is not zoonotic, meaning humans cannot get the disease directly from dogs. They can, however, get the disease from tick bites. If you think you have been exposed to ehrlichiosis, please seek medical attention immediately.  
"
"Obtaining a detailed history of travel and recent tick exposure can be useful when evaluating for ehrlichiosis. Your veterinarian will also start with a thorough physical examination to assess for fever, joint swelling/pain, and enlarged lymph nodes. A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will all likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation.
"
"Your veterinarian will ask about any recent travel history where tick exposure may have occurred and will want to do a full examination of your dog. They may order various blood tests, including a urinalysis, and serum blood chemistry, to ensure they have a baseline for diagnosis. If you vet believes ehrlichiosis is the issue they may recommend additional specialized laboratory testing.
"
"Most veterinarians use a Snap 4Dx test to annually check your dog for heartworms. In addition to heartworms, the test also checks for Lyme disease, Anaplasma, and Ehrlichia. According to the manufacturer’s website, the test would detect antibodies for E. canis or E. ewingii. In a healthy pet with no clinical signs, a positive Snap test for ehrlichiosis can be confusing and require additional testing.
"
"Sometimes the test is a false positive (meaning it is actually negative), but in all likelihood, your pet was exposed to the bacteria from an infected tick bite. Your vet may choose one of three options based on if your pet has any symptoms:
"
"Monitor your dog with no additional therapy
"
"Treat for ehrlichiosis
"
"Recommend additional testing, such as the PCR
"
"Ehrlichiosis is typically treated with a 28- to 30-day course of antibiotics, most often prescribing Doxycycline. Most dogs in the acute or subclinical phases will not require hospitalization and can be managed as outpatients at home with minimal supportive care (pain medications and appetite stimulants). Dogs with chronic ehrlichiosis may require hospitalization for aggressive supportive care that includes blood transfusions, steroids, IV fluids, and nutritional support.
"
"In many cases dogs with ehrlichiosis will also be infected with other tick-borne diseases, which may complicate diagnosis and treatment. Your veterinarian will customize a treatment plan to your dog’s specific needs.
"
"Dogs with acute or subclinical ehrlichiosis from E. canis tend to improve within one to two days of starting therapy and have an excellent prognosis for recovery. Dogs with E. ewingii infection tend to recover quickly after antibiotics have been initiated. Once recovered, dogs can still have antibodies in their blood for several years but are essentially cured of the infection.
"
"Unfortunately, the prognosis for dogs with chronic E. canis infection is guarded as this stage can be fatal. Dogs who survive ehrlichiosis can become re-infected later in life as immunity is not lifelong.
"
"Ehrlichiosis cannot be spread from dog to dog, but if multiple pets were exposed to the same area of ticks, please consult your veterinarian about testing and/or treating all dogs in your household.
"
"Although ehrlichiosis is not zoonotic (cannot be transmitted from dog to human), humans can still get the infection directly from a tick bite. If you believe you have been exposed to ehrlichiosis through a tick bite, seek medical care immediately.  
"
"Fortunately, most tick bites can be prevented through monthly flea and tick preventative care. There are plenty of options available, including topical, tablet, and chewable medications. Your veterinarian will be able to help you find the best option for your pet.
"
"If you live near wooded areas where ticks are prone, it is best to keep your dog away from these areas, since there currently is no vaccine for ehrlichiosis. When your dog comes back from any outdoor adventure, it’s important to inspect them for any ticks or fleas and remove them safely. Early removal of ticks is the best defense against the spread of any infection.
"
"Yes. With prompt, appropriate antibiotic therapy, ehrlichiosis can be cured. However, antibodies may remain present in the blood for years after successful treatment.
"
"No. Transmission from dogs to humans has never been reported. However, people can get ehrlichiosis from ticks, and since dogs and people are often exposed to the same tick population, it is possible for people and dogs in the same household to test positive for ehrlichiosis.

"The bacterium Escherichia coli, typically known as E. coli, is naturally found in the intestines of healthy dogs, on the skin, and in the environment. However, certain strains of E. coli can cause colibacillosis, an infection that is most often seen in young puppies.
"
"E. coli has the potential to infect virtually any system within the dog’s body. In adult dogs, it most commonly causes urinary tract infections.
"
"When humans think of E. coli, we often associate it with food poisoning. Although we don’t know how often E. coli causes diarrhea in dogs, it’s more common in dogs with underdeveloped or compromised immune systems, such as puppies.
"
"An E. coli infection in a puppy can quickly progress to sepsis, which is a medical emergency. Seek veterinary care immediately if your pet is having severe diarrhea, repeated vomiting, loss of appetite, is collapsing or weak, or is having difficulty breathing.
"
"E. coli infection in puppies usually comes on suddenly. Symptoms include:
"
"Vomiting
"
"Lack of interest in nursing
"
"Watery diarrhea
"
"Acting tired or weak
"
"Bluish tint to gums and other mucous membranes
"
"Feeling cold to the touch
"
"E. coli can affect other body systems. While these symptoms refer to E. coli infections in puppies, E. coli can also cause pneumonia, urinary tract infections, pyometra (pus-filled uterus), and other illnesses.
"
"E. coli infections in puppies are most common within the first few weeks of life. Because puppies haven’t yet developed their own immune system, they are more susceptible to infection.
"
"Puppies can become infected by E. coli in multiple ways:
"
"The mom’s first milk after giving birth (colostrum) is usually rich in antibodies that protect puppies from disease. If the mom doesn’t produce enough good colostrum or the puppies aren’t nursing well, they’ll be more susceptible to infection because they won’t get sufficient antibodies from their mom.
"
"If the mom has an E. coli infection, the bacteria can pass to the puppies while they are in her uterus, through the blood supply or during birth.
"
"If the mom has E. coli in her milk or has an infected mammary gland (mastitis), this can lead to infection of puppies as they nurse.
"
"E. coli infection may be more common in puppies born to dogs in unsanitary conditions, such as puppy mills or overcrowded kennels. Shelters may see more E. coli infections, as they often take in birthing or lactating mothers that haven’t received proper care.
"
"Additionally, there are reports of dogs contracting antibiotic-resistant E. coli from consuming raw meat. This is especially concerning because the humans preparing the food are also at risk of exposure.
"
"In puppies that have E. coli symptoms, the veterinarian is likely to perform a fecal flotation test to check for parasites and perform a parvovirus (parvo) test, which involves testing a small sample of feces. If these tests yield negative results, the vet will usually begin aggressively treating the symptoms.
"
"Confirmation of E. coli infection requires a culture. In adult dogs, cultures are more commonly performed for infections of specific body systems, such as the urinary tract. This ensures that the selected antibiotics effectively treat the infection.
"
"In severe cases where the animal is suspected to have an infection that has spread through their bloodstream (sepsis), the veterinarian will conduct a blood culture. Animals with sepsis are critically ill and are usually treated at a specialty clinic.
"
"Puppies with sepsis are often euthanized or die before the culture results are received. In most cases, veterinarians will aggressively initiate treatment without a definitive diagnosis and adjust the plan based on testing results.
"
"Important information to provide your veterinarian includes:
"
"Your dog’s vaccination history
"
"Dewormers or preventatives you use
"
"Medications your pet is taking
"
"Recent changes in diet or nursing behaviors
"
"Whether your pet eats raw meat
"
"For dogs with severe diarrhea or dehydration, inpatient treatment with intravenous fluids is recommended. In mild cases, fluids may be given subcutaneously (under the skin) on an outpatient basis.
"
"In severe cases of diarrhea leading to electrolyte imbalances or low blood sugar levels, electrolytes, and dextrose (a type of sugar) may be added to the fluids.
"
"Dogs with a poor appetite, particularly puppies, may need a feeding tube.
"
"Examples of medications that may be prescribed include:
"
"Antinausea medications: maropitant citrate and/or ondansetron
"
"Antacids and gastroprotectants: famotidine, omeprazole, sucralfate
"
"Pain medications: buprenorphine
"
"The use of antibiotics in most cases of diarrhea is controversial. However, in young puppies where sepsis is a concern, antibiotics will be started. E. coli is generally susceptible to a range of antibiotics, including amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and others.
"
"Nevertheless, it’s relatively common for E. coli to be resistant to specific antibiotics, so treatment should be adjusted based on culture and sensitivity results whenever possible.
"
"Puppies with E. coli infection may need to be bottle-fed to maintain adequate nutrition, especially if the mother has mastitis. If a puppy won’t take the bottle and isn’t nursing, seek veterinary help with tube-feeding.
"
"Puppies need to stay clean and warm. Regularly change their bedding and ensure you have clean hands and clean clothes when handling them.
"
"While some puppies will recover over several days, despite intensive treatment many puppies can rapidly decline, sometimes within hours of showing symptoms.
"
"While not all cases of E. coli are preventable, keeping a pregnant or nursing female healthy is important. If you have a breeding female, make sure to keep her in a sanitary environment. Regularly clean and change her bedding, and provide her with a high-quality, well-balanced diet.
"
"Monitor the puppies for nursing behaviors after birth to ensure they are nursing properly. If you notice redness, sores, or pus on or near the mother’s teats, seek treatment promptly. It’s best to avoid letting puppies nurse from an obviously infected mammary gland. Remember to wash your hands and wear clean clothes before handling puppies.
"
"If you feed your dog table scraps or a homemade diet, make sure that all meat is thoroughly cooked. After handling raw meat, wash your hands and clean all surfaces and utensils that have encountered it.
"
"Some puppies may recover from E. coli infection, while others can deteriorate rapidly within hours of showing symptoms. With proper supportive care, most adult dogs can overcome an E. coli infection and live a normal lifespan.
"
"Yes. Contact with dogs or their feces is considered a risk factor for the development of E. coli infections in people.
"
"Dogs with E. coli infection should be seen by a veterinarian. While many cases can be managed with supportive care and may not require intensive medical treatment, this treatment should be overseen by a veterinarian.

"Newborn puppies are born with an immature immune system that needs to be built up over time, starting with their mother's milk. Because of their immature body organs and systems, puppies are prone to various insults, including infections and environmental, nutritional, and metabolic factors. Also, young animals do not yet have strong body temperature regulation, and their body temperature can fluctuate profoundly in response to changing environmental temperatures and humidity. Glucose control may also be poor, and blood glucose levels may fall below normal ranges in cases of nutritional disturbances, leading to a state of hypoglycemia. Neonatal mortality, or fading syndrome, involves the death of puppies from birth to two weeks of age. This syndrome is more common in pedigree puppies.
"

"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your puppy's health, including a background history of symptoms and any background information you have regarding your puppy's parentage. After taking a complete history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination. Laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis.
"
"Blood testing may reveal anemia, changes in leukocyte (white blood cells, WBC) counts, including an abnormally low number of platelets (the cells responsible for blood clotting) and an increase in the number of white blood cells, which is what is usually seen in infections. A biochemistry profile may indicate abnormally low levels of glucose (hypoglycemia) along with other changes, depending on which organs are being the most affected. The urinalysis may indicate the presence of hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells, in the urine. It may also show bacteria present in the urine, indicating an infection of the urinary tract. More specific testing would include isolating the virus or bacteria from various body fluids. Your veterinarian will also conduct a fecal examination to test for the presence of parasites.
"
"
"
"In cases where a neonate is presenting with a low body temperature, the veterinarian will slowly warm the puppy to a normal body temperature over several hours to avoid shocking its system. Oxygen supplementation will be given if required, and intravenous fluid therapy will be initiated to correct fluid deficits.
"
"In cases with low glucose levels in the blood (hypoglycemia), fluids with glucose will be selected for fluid therapy. The puppy will not be allowed to feed if its body temperature is significantly lower than normal and it has no suckling reflex; however, once it has been warmed, nursing will be encouraged. Antibiotic therapy will be started in the event that there is a bacterial infections present.
"
"Do not attempt to feed your puppy at home if the puppy is not sucking properly at its mother's teat. Check your pupy daily for its hydration status by checking its urine color and looking into its mouth for evidence of dryness. Dry mouth and dark yellow urine will indicate that your puppy is dehydrated. If this is the case you will need to call your veterinarian for advice. Also monitor your puppy's weight daily, and ensure that the dam (mother) is properly nursing the puppies. Good home care will give your puppy the best chance of healing quickly and effectively.
"
"It is essential that you follow all guidelines to ensure proper medication and feeding at home. Do not stop or alter the treatment on your own or change the dosage times. It is especially important to give medications at the exact prescribed dosage and time because at this immature stage, animals have great variations in drug metabolism and excretion. Even minor changes in drug dosage can be detrimental to your puppy's recovery. Your puppy will also need extra care regarding its nutrition due to its delicate requirements and inability to feed properly on its own.
"
"Patients with low glucose levels will need extra care, and will need to be fed at a prescribed time of day, and at a frequency that is specific to your puppy's breed, age and size requirements.

"There are several conditions that can cause a pregnant dog, or dam, to experience premature contractions leading to preterm delivery of puppies. Bacterial infections, viral infections, death of one or more fetuses, ovarian cysts, hormonal imbalances, injury, malnutrition, a change in environment/moving, and basically any kind of stress that can send a dog into mental and physical distress can lead to early labor. In some cases, a dog's breed may genetically predispose it to preterm labor.
"
"Preterm delivery in dogs is defined by a birth that occurs before the ideal 60 days of gestation. Generally, puppies born at 58 days of gestation, or later, have a high chance for survival.
"
"Stressful events:
"
"If you find that your dog is experiencing early labor you will want to consult with your veterinarian. You will need to begin by giving your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health before and during pregnancy, her onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have brought this condition on. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, while being careful not to bring on any further undue stress. Standard laboratory tests may include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to make sure that there are no underlying diseases that are causing the premature labor symptoms. The blood tests will show whether your dog's progesterone levels are abnormally low.
"
"Ultrasound imaging will be performed to diagnose fetal death or abnormal position of fetuses, which may cause a difficult delivery. However, an ultrasound will also give your veterinarian a visual on the fetal heartbeats along with more fetal detail. If the puppies are stillborn, or if they die shortly after birth, they should be necropsied by your veterinarian to determine the cause of death.
"
"
"
"If your dog is going into labor early, immediately contact your veterinarian or call the nearest emergency veterinarian for guidance. Your dog will most probably require medical treatment, either for an illness or to remove stillborn fetuses.
"
"If your dog is pregnant you should not expose her to other animals in the three weeks before delivery and in the three weeks after giving birth. Even animals that have been living in your own house in close proximity with your dog should be segregated from her during this vulnerable time. As much as possible, keep the dog isolated in a warm, quiet room, where she can create a nesting area for herself and her puppies.
"
"Some dogs feel the need to be alone, while others have no problems giving birth with someone nearby. Some will even feel more comfortable with a trusted human companion nearby. If you can, provide both options to your dog. Do not give your dog any medications during pregnancy without first consulting with your veterinarian. This includes flea medications and vaccinations. If your veterinarian is treating your dog for anything, make sure to tell the doctor that your dog is pregnant. For example, you may allow your veterinarian to deworm your dog while it is pregnant, as long as you inform your veterinarian about the pregnancy.
"
"Do not board your dog in a kennel or otherwise move it unless you have no other option.
"
"If your dog has bloody vaginal discharge while still preterm, call your veterinarian for advice immediately. You may want to consider taking your dog to the veterinarian for a pregnancy check-up at 30 days of pregnancy to be sure that the pregnancy is progressing as it should.
"
"Most of the same precautions regarding medicines and vaccination hold true for the time following birth, while your dog is nursing her puppies. Always consult with your veterinarian before giving your dog anything that might make its way into her bloodstream and milk.

"Ear hematomas in dogs, also known as auricular hematomas or aural hematomas, occur when blood vessels rupture in the earflap, or pinna. As the blood accumulates, your dog’s ear will swell, forming an aural hematoma. 
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"If your dog has an ear hematoma, an ear infection is often its cause. One sign of an ear infection in dogs is excessive headshaking, caused by irritation in the ear.
"
"If your dog’s ear is infected, their earflap will swell and become red and warm to the touch. The swelling may involve the entire earflap, or it may cover only part of it. You may also notice a foul odor or discharge coming from your dog’s ear.
"
"In most cases, only one ear will be affected; however, both ears can have hematomas.
"
"The most common cause of an ear hematoma in dogs is an ear infection or other irritation within the ear. Dog ear infections cause irritation that results in headshaking, which in turn, causes the ear hematoma.
"
"Other causes for headshaking, such as ear mites, having something stuck in their ear, and underlying issues such as allergies, can lead to an ear hematoma. Less commonly, allergic skin disease in dogs, immune disorders, trauma, or blood clotting deficits can cause ear hematomas in dogs.
"

"
"If you’ve ever seen your dog shaking his head or scratching his ears excessively, you may wonder if he has an infection or allergies.
"
"However, ear mites, also referred to as Otodectes cynotis, may be the culprit.
"
"Although ear mites are relatively uncommon in dogs compared to cats, they are still an important parasite for pet parents to be aware of. They are most often seen in puppies and dogs who spend extended time outdoors.
"
"Ear mites are tiny parasites that live in a dog’s ear canals and cause extreme itching, pain, and abnormal discharge. Left untreated, they can lead to secondary infections or hearing loss.
"
"Ear mites are not considered a medical emergency. However, because they cause significant discomfort for dogs, they should be treated soon.
"
"If you think your dog may have ear mites, schedule a veterinary appointment quickly for the right diagnosis.
"
"Ear mites in dogs can cause the following symptoms:
"
"Head shaking
"
"Itchy, red ears
"
"While we typically never give our appliances and lights a second thought, they can be very dangerous for playful and inquisitive puppies. Electrocution from chewing on an electrical cord is the single most common type of electrical injury for household pets. These types of injuries can result in burns to the surrounding areas (typically the mouth), damage to the heart, lungs, and other tissues, and death.
"
"Possible complications of electric cord bite injuries are fluid buildup in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and abnormal heart rhythms. Additionally, there have been reports of animals developing cataracts (an eye abnormality) after such injuries.
"
"The most obvious sign of an electrical injury is burns in or around your dog’s mouth. If either the whiskers or the hair surrounding the mouth are singed, this can also be an indication that your dog has been burned at some point.
"
"Other serious symptoms are related to your dog’s breathing and heart rhythm. Muscle tremors, seizures, and collapse are also possible. Some signs of a serious electrical injury are:
"
"Burns
"
"Coughing
"
"Abnormally fast breathing
"
"Needing to be upright to breathe properly
"
"Crackling sounds in the lungs
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Bluish-tinged skin and mucous membranes
"
"Weakness
"
"Eclampsia is low blood calcium that can occur in a pregnant or nursing dog. This condition is also known as periparturient hypocalcemia or puerperal tetany.
"
"Eclampsia is most common in small breed mothers when her puppies are two to four weeks old.
"
"Calcium is needed for most of the important functions in a pup’s body.
"
"When calcium becomes dangerously low, it can quickly become life-threatening.
"
"When a nursing dog is making large amounts of milk, she can use up her body's natural calcium stores and develop eclampsia.
"
"While eclampsia is not common in dogs eating a proper diet, it’s the cause for about a quarter of emergencies related to breeding females. 
"
"Eclampsia is a medical emergency. If you suspect your dog has eclampsia, get her to an emergency veterinarian immediately; it can become life-threatening within hours.
"
"Symptoms of eclampsia in dogs include:
"
"Walking stiffly
"
"Ear hematomas are diagnosed by physical examination. The veterinarian will recognize the characteristic signs: the earflap is warm and swollen, and often red and inflamed-looking on the inside. Most often, hematomas are noticed with an ear infection or other reasons for constant headshaking.
"
"Addressing the primary cause for your dog’s headshaking is also necessary. The vet will examine your dog’s ear with an otoscope and will often recommend taking a sample or ear swab for cytology. This means looking at the swab under a microscope to identify the presence of bacteria and/or yeast.
"
"Several different dog ear hematoma treatments exist to reduce the swelling.
"
"In some cases, when medical management is attempted, medications such as steroids, antibiotics, and/or pain relievers may be used. These may also be used in combination with surgical treatment, such as ear drainage or an incision. Underlying conditions such as ear mites or ear infections will also need to be treated.
"
"Surgical drainage of the ear hematoma may be recommended if the swelling is large enough to cause pain, discomfort, or blockage of the ear canal. Your vet might also suggest surgical drainage if they are concerned that scarring may lead to permanent deformity of the ear canal.
"
"In this procedure, the hematoma would be pierced and drained under anesthesia, but it is likely to recur and may need to be drained multiple times.
"
"In most cases, a drain is placed in your dog’s ear to keep additional fluid from building up within the earflap. Alternatively, a surgical incision with strategically placed sutures may be placed through the earflap to discourage the accumulation of fluid and encourage drainage.
"
"Curing an ear hematoma also means dealing with the initial disease that caused your dog to shake their head in the first place, whether it’s an ear infection, mites, or something else.
"
"After ear hematoma surgery, the veterinarian may place bandages over your dog’s ear and head and will recommend an Elizabethan collar. At home, you may be asked to administer medications by mouth or in the ear via a hole in the bandage. You will also need to monitor the bandage.
"
"A follow-up appointment will be needed so your vet can assess healing. The E-collar must be worn to prevent your dog from scratching at the wound, which could result in trauma to the area and removal of the bandage and/or stitches.
"
"In some cases, despite prompt and appropriate medical care, scarring can result in slight deformity of the earflap.
"
"Preventing ear infections and ear mites will also help prevent the formation of hematomas in your dog. When ear infections or mites do occur, they should be treated promptly to avoid the formation of a hematoma.
"
"If you see these common signs, take your dog to the vet so they can be properly diagnosed and treated for an ear infection or ear mites before a hematoma develops:
"
"Frequent head shaking
"
"Excessive ear scratching
"
"Pain, redness, or odor
"
"Crust in the ear or discharge

"Ear mites are mainly spread by close contact with another animal, such as a dog or cat, who already has ear mites.
"
"Since ear mites are highly contagious, all pets who live in the same house are likely to become infected if one animal does. Dogs can also pick up ear mites from the environment or from contaminated bedding or toys.
"
"Dogs of all ages can be affected by ear mites.
"
"Those who do not get monthly flea, tick, and heartworm preventatives are at an increased risk of getting ear mites, since they don’t have parasite protection.
"
"A veterinarian will first examine your dog, paying close attention to his ears. An otoscope is a special tool that is used to investigate your dog’s ear canals to find abnormal discharge or inflammation (swelling).
"
"The veterinarian will ask whether your dog is on any monthly preventatives, when symptoms began, and whether there are any other cats or dogs in the household.
"
"If the veterinarian suspects ear mites, diagnostic testing can be done.
"
"An ear cytology is the preferred test to diagnose ear mites in dogs.
"
"During this test, a veterinarian uses a cotton swab to gently collect a small amount of debris from the dog’s ear canal.
"
"The debris is mixed with a drop of mineral oil on a glass slide and viewed under a microscope to find ear mites or their eggs.
"
"Another sample from the ear canal can be added to a slide, then stained and viewed under a microscope to look for yeast or bacteria.
"
"These could be causing a secondary ear infection, which is very common among dogs with ear mites.
"
"To treat ear mites in dogs, the ears must be thoroughly cleaned and medicated.
"
"First, a dog’s ears are cleaned with an ear cleanser.
"
"Epi-Otic® Advanced is commonly used, but if the veterinarian diagnosed a secondary bacterial infection, TrizULTRA™+ Keto Flush, which is an antimicrobial ear cleanser, may be used instead.
"
"Collapse
"
"Seizures
"
"Sudden death
"
"Any dog who may have been electrocuted needs to be seen by a veterinarian immediately.
"
"The most common cause of electrocution in dogs is because a young puppy chewed on a household electrical cord—commonly from Christmas lights, fans, TVs, or other appliances.
"
"Most electrical injuries are seen in animals younger than 2 years old. Whether it’s because of teething, because your puppy has a natural tendency to chew on things, or if your dog is just curious about cords, it’s during these younger years that injury is most likely to happen.
"
"Dogs who arrive at the veterinary hospital in critical condition will immediately be taken to a treatment area. For example, if your dog is having severe trouble breathing, she could be placed in an oxygen cage and monitored closely.
"
"Once the pet’s condition is stable, your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam and ask you some questions about what you witnessed at home. While the above symptoms can indicate an electrical cord injury, there are other possibilities as well.
"
"The veterinarian will check your dog’s mouth for burns and listen to their heart and lungs. They might also take x-rays of the chest and an electrocardiogram to further assess heart and lung function. They may also run some bloodwork to check for damage elsewhere in the body, such as the kidneys and liver.
"
"Pulmonary edema may develop in the hours after a pet has been electrocuted, so the veterinarian may recommend hospitalizing your dog for monitoring and any additional diagnostic tests and treatments that may be needed.
"
"If you witness the electrocution, turn off the electricity before moving your dog. If your dog is not breathing and does not have a heartbeat, clear their airway as best as you can and provide assistance through CPR. All dogs who may have been electrocuted should be taken to a vet as soon as possible.
"
"Depending on a dog’s condition, treatment for electrocution may include:
"
"Pain relief for burns
"
"Antibiotics to prevent infection
"
"Oxygen therapy
"
"Fluid therapy
"
"Nutritional support
"
"Medications to normalize heart rhythms, eliminate fluid from the lungs, and manage seizures
"
"Your dog will need to be closely monitored until their condition stabilizes. They may not feel comfortable eating their regular food because of the pain associated with wounds in the mouth, so you might need to switch to soft foods or liquefy their dry food until their wounds have healed. Your veterinarian can help you make a diet plan until your dog can comfortably eat regular food again.
"
"At home, monitor the burn wounds for infection and proper healing. Surgery is sometimes necessary if burned tissues cannot repair themselves on their own.
"
"The most important step in preventing electrical injury is to keep your dog away from electrical cords and outlets. Additionally, inspect all cords in your home and throw out any that are damaged, since even minimal contact with a bare wire can cause serious harm to your dog.
"
"Many pet parents find that using baby-proofing measures work for protecting their pets against injury. Most hardware and full-service department stores carry household child-protection tools.

"Most dogs with eclampsia start with mild signs. They tend to pant a lot and be restless and walk around stiffly.
"
"This usually rapidly progresses to trembling, weakness, and seizures.
"
"Eclampsia occurs when a dog’s calcium supply becomes dangerously low.
"
"This most often happens in small-breed first-time mothers with a large litter. Chihuahuas, Toy Poodles, Pomeranians, Shih Tzus, and other small-breed dogs are at a higher risk.
"
"Mothers that are more attentive to their puppies have a higher chance of developing eclampsia.
"
"Eclampsia most commonly occurs two to four weeks after the puppies are born, when their mother’s milk production is at its highest. The high amount of milk a mother is making takes too much calcium from her body. This can also happen during pregnancy, when the mother’s body is using its stored calcium to form her puppies’ bones.
"
"Giving oral calcium supplements to mothers during pregnancy can lead to eclampsia instead of stopping it. A dog’s body thinks it has enough calcium, so they stop making natural calcium. This, in turn, leads to a shortage.
"
"There are some diseases of the parathyroid gland that can also affect calcium levels and result in eclampsia, such as hypoparathyroidism.
"
"Finally, poor diet during pregnancy or nursing can play a big role in developing eclampsia.
"
"When a mother’s body uses large amounts of her calcium to feed her puppies, it is very important that she be fed a balanced, nutrient-rich, high-quality diet.
"
"Feeding commercial diets labeled for pregnant or lactating (nursing) moms or growing puppies—instead of normal adult dog food—is recommended during pregnancy and lactation.
"
"Eclampsia is usually diagnosed based on a history of recent pregnancy and/or lactation and clinical signs.
"
"Your veterinarian will do a thorough physical exam. They may recommend blood work or X-rays.
"
"Serum calcium levels can be found through bloodwork, but treatment is often started right away if eclampsia is suspected.
"
"If your dog is ill, it’s important that you tell your veterinarian if she is pregnant or nursing puppies; this may affect how quickly treatment is given.
"
"Ear cleansers remove debris to allow medication to work better and are used once daily until the mites and infection are gone.
"
"Topical and oral flea, tick, and heartworm preventatives are the main treatment for ear mites.
"
"Although these products are not directly labeled to be used for ear mites, they are highly effective.
"
"The use of these medications for ear mites is considered off-label, but many medications in veterinary medicine are prescribed in this way and are safe under the guidance of a veterinarian.
"
"Topical medications are applied to the dog’s skin in between the shoulder blades, and oral medications are given by mouth.
"
"A single treatment is typically effective at getting rid of the ear mites. Examples of preventatives that are used include Bravecto® and Advantage Multi™.
"
"Topical ointment, such as Animax®, will be prescribed if the dog also has a bacterial or yeast infection.
"
"It’s typically put on the ear canals after cleansing twice daily for a week. Dogs who are in a lot of pain or very itchy may benefit from topical or oral steroids, such as prednisone.
"
"Ear mites are extremely contagious, so if one pet is diagnosed, all pets in your household should be treated for ear mites.
"
"Most commonly, a single course of treatment is all that is needed if the ear cleanings and medications were given continuously and as prescribed by the veterinarian.
"
"Dogs typically start feeling better a day or two after starting treatment. Ear mites can take up to 30 days to be fully eliminated from the dog’s ear canals.
"
"Following treatment, pet parents should bring their dog back to the veterinarian for a repeat ear cytology to check that the ear mites are gone.
"
"If the dog is still having symptoms or the ear cytology shows ear mites or infection, another round of treatment may be prescribed.
"
"Keeping your dog up to date on flea, tick, and heartworm preventatives year-round will protect him from ear mites.
"
"Cleaning your dog’s ears weekly will remove debris and lower the risk for infections as well.
"
"Ear mites can be found throughout your house, especially in bedding or toys that an infected animal touched.
"
"However, they do not survive for long in the environment, so with proper cleaning and disinfection, they should be gone quickly.
"
"It’s highly unlikely for a person to get ear mites from their dog.
"
"However, if an ear mite from a dog jumps onto and bites a person, it may cause itchiness or a skin rash.
"
"Yes, dogs with ear mites must be treated by a veterinarian. Prescription medications are needed to get rid of the ear mites and reduce inflammation in the ear canal.

"Eclampsia is treated by fixing the calcium shortage.
"
"This is done by slow intravenous (IV) injection by your veterinarian. They will likely place an IV catheter and start your dog on IV fluids, in addition to IV calcium, to fix any dehydration or electrolyte shortages your pup may have.
"
"Because eclampsia becomes life-threatening so quickly, it’s almost always treated on an emergency basis in a veterinary clinic rather than at home.
"
"If your dog is having seizures, your vet may give her anti-seizure medications such as midazolam or diazepam.
"
"If your dog has a fever, cooling mechanisms (like cool IV fluids or rubbing alcohol on your dog’s paw pads) may be used until her body temperature falls below 103 F.
"
"Calcium is involved in muscle contraction of the heart, so it’s important that the heart rate be closely watched while the imbalance is fixed.
"
"Your dog may be attached to an electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor their heart while being treated.
"
"Your vet may also decide to admit your dog into the hospital and keep her on IV fluids, depending on the severity of her eclampsia. Severe cases can lead to cerebral edema, which is fluid on the brain.
"
"In some cases, once the initial imbalance is fixed, a dog can be sent home for continued outpatient treatment with injections under the skin or oral medications.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend oral calcium carbonate tablets and vitamin D supplements after getting your dog stable when she is discharged from the clinic.
"
"Tums® are often recommended at home following a diagnosis of eclampsia until your dog stops producing milk.
"
"When treated immediately, affected dogs usually recover well from eclampsia. Recovery is often very fast with your dog returning to normal behavior within hours.
"
"After getting your dog home, try to keep her comfortable and allow her to rest. If she had seizures or spasms while her body lacked calcium, she may be exhausted after the ordeal.
"
"Keep her apart from her puppies for 12 to 24 hours, so the pups can’t latch to her or nurse right away.
"
"Eclampsia will reoccur again in 20% of patients if they go back to nursing when they return home.
"
"For that reason, switching to formula or weaning is recommended if the puppies are old enough. If they're under 4 weeks of age, switch to formula and bottle feed them.
"
"If they are over 4 weeks of age, wean them the traditional way by transitioning to commercial puppy food.
"
"When buying formula, purchase a high-quality milk replacer like Esbilac®.
"
"Puppies less than two weeks of age should be fed every three to four hours, while puppies two to four weeks of age can be fed every six to eight hours.
"
"Puppies older than four weeks can begin the weaning process and start to eat commercial puppy food.

"
"It's important to note that if a dog has had eclampsia in the past, they are likely to have it again with future litters if they continue to breed.
"
"The best way to prevent eclampsia in dogs is to feed a good, high-quality commercial pet food that is made for pregnant or nursing mothers.
"
"Often, you can do this with food made for puppies instead of adults, as these diets have more vitamins and minerals.
"
"Royal Canin® Starter Mother &amp; Baby Dry Dog Food, Hill's Science Diet® Puppy Healthy Development, Purina® Pro Plan Puppy, and Royal Canin® Small Puppy are all excellent choices.
"
"Supplementing with calcium during pregnancy is not recommended. This can increase a dog's risk of developing eclampsia.
"
"If your dog is pregnant and has suffered from eclampsia with past litters, your vet may recommend supplementing with oral calcium, like Pet-Cal®, after she has given birth and is nursing.
"
"Talk to your vet before starting any supplements to ensure they're the right choice for your dog.
"
"If you have a small breed dog with a large litter of puppies, consider giving her multiple small breaks throughout the day—away from her pups—so she can eat and rest.
"
"Be sure she always has access to plenty of food and water.
"
"Start giving puppy food to the puppies, in addition to nursing, when they are three to four weeks of age.
"
"This will help to supplement their calorie needs so that they don’t need as much milk from their mother.
"
"Feed your dog a high-quality commercial dog food labeled for pregnant or lactating moms or puppies. These diets are higher in vitamins and minerals and should help to meet their nutritional needs.
"
"The cost of treatment varies depending on whether it happens during regular office hours and how severely your dog is affected.
"
"Average treatment costs can range from $300 to $1,500.

"Dogs have an ""L"" shaped ear canal.  At the bottom end of the ""L"" is the eardrum (tympanic membrane), and behind the eardrum is the middle ear. When the ear becomes infected, only the outer, ""L"" shaped portion of the ear is usually affected, a condition referred to as otitis externa. Sometimes, the middle ear will become infected as well, in a condition referred to as otitis media. Infections of the middle ear can occur if the eardrum is ruptured or if an infection of the outer ear goes on for a long time. When middle ear infections go on for a long time, one of the complications that may follow is the formation of a cyst (fluid filled sac) near the eardrum. This cyst is called a cholesteatoma.
"
"Ear infections that are present for a long time, sometimes more than a year, are the most common cause of cholesteatomas in dogs. All breeds and ages of dogs have been reported to get cholesteatomas, though some breeds may have certain physical characteristics that predispose them to ear problems.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will use a diagnostic tool called an otoscope, an instrument with a light and a cone on one end that is designed for examining the ear. This will help your veterinarian to identify any kind of material or presence of discharge in your dog’s ear canal, as well as to determine how swollen the ear canal is. Your veterinarian will also be looking for any damage to the eardrum.  Often, in the case of a long-term ear infection, your veterinarian will not be able to see the eardrum because of swelling and discharge in the ear canal. A sample of the material in your dog’s ears will be taken for culture to determine what bacteria may be causing your dog’s ear infection. Your veterinarian will also order x-ray imaging of your dog’s head.  These x-rays will allow your veterinarian to look at the middle part of the ear (behind the ear drum) that cannot be seen with an otoscope. X-rays will also help to identify how much of the ear is involved and whether or not the jaw is also involved.  Your veterinarian may also order a computed tomography (CT) scan if the x-rays do not provide enough information to confirm a diagnosis. A CT scan will give very detailed information about how much of your dog’s ear is involved in the infection. This will assist your veterinarian in deciding what the best therapy will be for your dog.
"
"
"
"Surgery is usually the best treatment for cholesteatomas. During surgery, your dog’s ear canal will be removed along with the cholesteatoma. This will not affect the external appearance of your dog’s ear once it has healed after surgery. However, your dog’s hearing may be decreased on the side that was operated on. Many dogs, however, can hear as well after surgery as they could before. One of the possible complications of surgery is injury to the nerves that control the facial movements. This is not always permanent and usually heals with time.
"
"After surgery, your dog will be on antibiotics and may need to wear a bandage on its head for a period of time. It is important for you to return to your veterinarian for bandage changes if necessary. It is also very important for you to dispense all of the antibiotics that you are given for your dog, even if it seems that your dog has fully recovered. You will need to monitor the surgery area once or twice daily to check for any extra swelling or discharge at the surgery site and report back to your veterinarian if the site does not appear to be healing as it should. Your veterinarian will schedule follow up visits to monitor the progress of the healing, but once your dog has fully recovered from surgery, it will be able to return to a normal life.
"
"It is important to treat any ear infections that your dog gets as soon as you notice symptoms. Make sure to give all of the medication that your veterinarian gives you for your dog to treat the infection, even if your dog seems to be feeling better.
"
"If your dog has physical characteristics that may predispose it to ear infections, make sure that you are familiar with ways by which you can avoid problems. For example, if your dog has excessively hairy ears, as poodles tend to, you can make sure that the ears are regularly groomed and cleaned out before dirt and objects have a chance to get caught in them. A word of caution: cotton swabs ought never be used inside of a dog’s ear canals. A soft cotton tissue is sufficient for removing dirt and excess skin from the exterior of the ear canal.

"Ear tumors in dogs are any abnormal growths on or within the ear of the dog. Benign tumors tend to grow slowly and don’t spread (metastasize). Malignant tumors grow rapidly, invade local tissues, and sometimes metastasize.
"
"Ear cancer refers to the subset of ear tumors that are malignant. Not all ear tumors are cancerous, but all ear cancers are tumors.
"
"Cancer can affect any part of your dog’s ear—the pinna, external ear canal, middle ear, and inner ear. The pinna is the cartilaginous flap of the ear that either stands up or droops down. The external ear canal is the tube going into the ear that you can see when you hold up your dog’s pinna.
"
"In dogs, the ear canal has both a vertical and a horizontal component. At the end of the horizontal component is the eardrum, which marks the start of the middle ear. The middle ear is a cavity (tympanic cavity) that contains three tiny bones that transmit sound to the inner ear. The inner ear contains nerves for hearing and receptors that are important for balance.
"
"Ear cancer is uncommon in dogs. Ear cancer affecting the pinna or external ear canal is more common than cancer affecting the middle or inner ear.
"
"Ear cancer in dogs can be classified into three groups:
"
"Cancer of the pinna
"
"Cancer of the external ear canal
"
"Cancer of the middle or inner ear
"
"Tumors on the ear flap are more likely to be benign than tumors inside the ear. Cancers on the pinna tend to be skin cancers, and common types include mast cell tumors and squamous cell carcinoma. Mast cell tumors are tumors of a specific white blood cell found in connective tissue, especially under the skin. Squamous cell carcinoma is cancer of the cells that form under the skin surface.
"
"Cancer of the external ear canal is more common than cancer in the middle or inner ear. The two most common cancers affecting this outer part of the ear are ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma is cancer of the specialized glands that secrete materials found in ear wax.
"
"Cancers originating in the middle or inner ear of dogs are rare.
"
"Symptoms of ear tumors in dogs vary depending on tumor location. Signs of a tumor on the pinna include:
"
"A firm or soft mass on the ear flap
"
"A wound associated with the mass
"
"Scratching at the pinna
"
"Reacting painfully when the ear flap is touched
"
"Tumors in the external ear canal can be hard to see, particularly if they’re deep in the canal. You typically won’t be able to feel these nodules. Unless the mass protrudes from the opening to the external ear canal, your veterinarian will need an otoscope to see the tumor.
"
"Signs include:
"
"A pink, white, or purple nodular mass within the canal
"
"Recurrent or chronic ear infections
"
"Inflamed, itchy, painful ear
"
"Waxy, pus-filled, or bloody discharge from the ear
"
"Foul odor from the ear
"
"Headshaking
"
"Scratching at the ear
"
"Reacting painfully to having the ear touched
"
"If the middle or inner ear is affected, you’ll see most of the same signs you’d see with an external ear canal mass. However, your dog’s balance and neurologic function may also be affected.
"
"Symptoms could include:
"
"Head tilt
"
"Circling
"
"Rolling
"
"Loss of balance and coordination
"
"Rapid eye movements, usually side-to-side
"
"Loss of hearing
"
"Facial paralysis, causing difficulty blinking or the face to droop on one side
"
"Horner syndrome (different pupil sizes, drooping of the upper lid, sunken eye, third eyelid raised)
"
"Recurrent or long-term inflammation and genetics likely play a role in the development of ear cancer. Chronic inflammation can eventually lead to the development of cancer.
"
"Breeds predisposed to ear cancer affecting the external ear canal or inner ear include Cocker Spaniels, German Shepherds, and Pugs. Dogs that are more likely to develop cancer on their pinna are those that are prone to skin cancer, such as Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Bulldogs, Boxers, and Boston Terriers.
"
"Your veterinarian may see the ear tumor during a routine physical that includes an otoscopic exam of the ear canal—which is why annual exams are so important.  
"
"If the tumor is on the pinna, your veterinarian will use a needle to collect a sample of cells to look at under a microscope. With this sample, your veterinarian may be able to determine the type of tumor or if the tumor has signs of malignancy. Surgical biopsy (sending a sample to a reference lab) may be necessary.
"
"For tumors in the external ear canal, your veterinarian may need an otoscope to view the tumor. If your veterinarian can reach the tumor, they may aspirate or biopsy the tumor to determine the type.
"
"Most cancers of the external ear canal, middle ear, and inner ear do not metastasize but are locally invasive. A computed tomography (CT) scan is needed to determine the extent of the tumor. If you plan to pursue surgery, a CT scan helps with surgical planning.
"
"The treatment of choice for ear cancer is usually surgical removal. For cancers that are on the pinna, this includes removing part of or the entire ear flap (partial or total pinnectomy).
"
"Cancers within the ear canal require a more complex surgical procedure called a total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy (TECA-LBO). With this procedure, the entire ear canal is removed.
"
"In the bulla osteotomy portion of the surgery, the bony structure on the bottom of the skull (tympanic bulla) is opened to remove secretory structures. At the end of this procedure, your dog will have an ear flap but no ear canal. They may still be able to hear from this ear, but their hearing will be reduced or muffled.
"
"Radiation therapy may be recommended for tumors that are too extensive for surgery, including tumors within the middle or inner ear. Radiation therapy is an anesthetized procedure that is repeated for a specified number of treatments over multiple days. For tumors that have metastasized, chemotherapy may be recommended.
"
"Supportive care for your pet will include pain medications and antibiotics to manage infections.
"
"In cases affecting the pinna or external ear canal, surgery is often curative. To prevent your pet from scratching at their incision, ensure they wear a recovery cone after surgery.
"
"Because this surgery involves removing a large portion of the ear, which is closely associated with several important nerves, you may notice facial paralysis or balance issues after surgery. Be sure to formulate a plan for management of side effects with your veterinarian before surgery. If they are having issues with balance or coordination, keep your pet away from stairs and other areas they may fall from. Do not let them outside unattended.
"
"Most dogs will show improvement in pain levels within a few days of surgery. Make sure to work with your veterinarian to develop a good pain management plan. After recovering from surgery, most dogs will adjust to life with one functioning ear and return to their typical affectionate selves.

"Dry eye syndrome in dogs, also known as Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS), involves decreased or inadequate tear production. Tears are important to the lubrication, comfort, and overall health of a dog’s eyes. Tears also contain antibacterial proteins, mucus, white blood cells to fight infection, and other enzymes to help keep the eyes clear and free of debris, infection, and irritations. 
"
"A dog’s tears have three parts: 
"
"Lipid (fat) layer  
"
"Aqueous (water) 
"
"Mucin layer  
"
"Two glands, the lacrimal and third eyelid, are responsible for producing the watery layer of tears. In dogs with dry eye syndrome, these glands contribute little or nothing to the tears, even though the glands responsible for the lipid and mucin layers still function. This typically results in dry but gooey, mucous-filled eyes. 
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Dogs with dry eye syndrome can exhibit one or many of the following symptoms: 
"
"Red, inflamed, irritated, and painful eyes 
"
"Redness and swelling of the conjunctiva, or the tissues around the eye 
"
"Frequent squinting and blinking 
"
"Dryness on the surface of the cornea—the outer clear dome-shaped part of the eye 
"
"Mucous-like discharge on the cornea (may be yellow or green if a secondary bacterial infection is present) 
"
"Obvious defects and irregularities of the cornea, including increased vascularization (abnormal growth of blood vessels to the injured area) and pigmentation as the eye attempts to heal and protect itself 
"
"Possible vision impairment and blindness 
"
"The cause of dry eye syndrome in a dog can be due to one or a few underlying conditions. Your veterinarian will be able to determine what may have caused your pet’s diagnosis based on the dog’s medical history and an exam. Some of the underlying causes may be due to: 
"
"Immune system dysfunction: Most cases of dry eye syndrome in dogs are caused by the immune system attacking and destroying the lacrimal and third eyelid gland. Unfortunately, veterinarians do not know why this happens.  
"
"Medications: Certain drugs can cause dry eye syndrome as a side effect, usually very shortly after a dog starts taking these medications. This type of dry eye syndrome can be temporary and may go away once the medication is discontinued. However, permanent damage can be done, and there is no way to predict which animals will have dry eye syndrome or how long it will last. Be sure to talk with your vet about possible side effects of all medications.  
"
"Genes: Congenital alacrimia is a genetic form of dry eye syndrome and occurs in some breeds, most notably Yorkshire terriers. This is typically noticed in only one eye.  
"
"Endocrine conditions: Some systemic disease (such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, and Cushing’s disease) frequently decrease tear production. 
"
"Infectious diseases: Canine distemper virus, leishmaniasis, and chronic blepharoconjunctivitis can all lead to dry eye syndrome. 
"
"Medical procedures: A common abnormality of dogs is a prolapsed third eyelid gland (more commonly known as cherry eye). While it is not recommended, some surgeons remove the gland entirely, leading to permanent decreased tear production. Local radiation for tumors can also cause permanent damage to the lacrimal and third eyelid glands. 
"
"Neurological problems: Loss of nerve function to the glands (commonly secondary to an inner ear infection) can decrease or stop production of tears. 
"
"Traumatic injury: Dry eye syndrome can occur with damage to the glands after severe inflammation or injury (such as from wounds or car accidents). 
"
"Transient causes: Anesthesia causes a temporary loss of tear production, as does the medication atropine. Once these are removed, tear production normally returns.  
"
"Vets use the Schirmer Tear Test (STT) to diagnose dry eye syndrome and measure aqueous tear production in dogs. This is a simple, painless test involving a strip of special paper placed in the lower eyelid. The moisture and tears from the eye wick onto the paper for 60 seconds. At the end of that time, the vet measures the tear production on the paper. For test results, more than 15 millimeters of tear production per minute is normal, while less than 10 millimeters indicates dry eye syndrome. Your vet may repeat the test to confirm the diagnosis.  
"
"After the STT, your vet may also perform a fluorescein stain test to look for corneal ulcers. The stain makes an ulcer glow bright green under a black light. The vet may also use a test of intraocular pressure to look for inflammation or glaucoma. These conditions are common with dry eye and important to diagnose and treat at the same time.
"
"Your vet will determine the best treatment for your dog, depending on their diagnosis and their previous medical history. Treatment options may include: 
"
"Lacrimostimulants: Most commonly, vets prescribe ophthalmic cyclosporine (a class of medications) or tacrolimus to stimulate tear production. Cyclosporine, when applied in the eye, keeps the immune system from harming the lacrimal and third eyelid glands, thus allowing tear restoration. Tacrolimus is typically used only if cyclosporine fails.  
"
"Lacrimomimetics: Artificial tears moisten the surface of the eye, improve comfort, and help flush debris and allergens. These eye lubricants are essential to use with primary medications for dry eye syndrome, like cyclosporine, especially early in the treatment process when tear production hasn’t fully recovered. Only use artificial tears if your vet directs you. 
"
"Antibiotics: Bacterial infections and corneal ulcerations may also require broad-spectrum topical antibiotics. Dogs whose dry eye syndrome is related to the nervous system are treated with pilocarpine, which stimulates glandular secretion.  
"
"Surgery: Dogs who don’t respond to treatment may require a surgery called parotid duct transposition, which carefully redirects saliva glands in the dog’s mouth to the eye, so that saliva can be used as tears. 
"
"Your vet will do the STT every 3-4 weeks initially to confirm the medication and treatment plan is working for your dog. If there is still inadequate tear production, dosing frequency and medications can be adjusted. Most dogs with dry eye syndrome improve within 12 weeks, with many showing positive changes within the first 6 weeks. Once a dog has adequate tear production, periodic rechecks should be scheduled, usually every 3-4 months.  
"
"Most dogs respond to the treatments available and return to normal vision and a pain-free life. Monitoring and early veterinary intervention are important. In dogs with an STT of 2-14 millimeters per minute, there is more than an 80 percent chance of regaining normal tear production. In more severe cases—dogs with a response of 0-1 millimeters per minute—the full recovery rate falls to less than 50 percent.
"
"Some types of dry eye syndrome are reversible. However, the most common causes are only manageable with medication.
"
"Without proper tear production, eyes become irritated, inflamed, infected, and even ulcerated. All of these conditions are extremely uncomfortable and painful for your dog.
"
"Over-the-counter artificial tears and eye lubricants are critical to the overall comfort and stability of the eyes when your dog has dry eye syndrome, especially early on. It is important to use products approved for dogs, and to discuss any product option with your vet first.

"In cases of dog poisoning, the most common cause is unintentional overdosing of medications.
"
"Prescription pet medication is easily overconsumed by dogs, since it is usually flavored to make it more appealing and easier to swallow. If these medications are kept in an accessible place, a pet will quickly and easily consume them.
"
"Besides veterinary pills, the other common factor in drug poisoning is the administration of over-the-counter drugs by a dog owner without prior consultation from a veterinarian.
"
"Many over-the-counter and prescription medications used for people are toxic to dogs. Additionally, what is not taken into account is that the same drug dose given to a human cannot be given to an animal. Incorrect dosages will often result in overdosing and drug poisoning.
"
"Even as little as one dose of an acetaminophen (Tylenol®) pain reliever can cause severe organ damage in a medium-size dog. Because animals do not have the natural enzymes necessary for detoxifying and eliminating drugs made for humans, medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen are a major cause of dog poisoning.
"
"If you suspect your dog has had access to drugs, you will typically find evidence, whether it is an empty container or a box that has been torn apart, though you may need to look in your dog’s favorite hiding spots.
"
"If your pet has begun vomiting before the entire pill or capsule has been digested, you may find whole pills, or the undigested exterior of a capsule. If the drug was liquid, it will be more difficult to differentiate the liquid drug from the rest of the content in the vomit.
"
"The most useful information you can give your veterinarian is what type of drug was ingested by your pet. Even if you are not entirely sure how much of the drug was ingested, your pet's doctor will have a point from which to begin treatment.
"
"Bring any information you can with you to the veterinarian, such as the pill or liquid drug container, and any pills that you can find. Your veterinarian is not there to judge you; she just wants to know what your dog got ahold of so that she can treat him properly.
"
"Dog poisoning symptoms include:
"
"Vomiting
"
"Lethargy
"
"Abdominal pain
"
"Loss of appetite
"
"Excessive salivation
"
"Lack of coordination
"
"Bloody urine
"
"Overdosing of veterinary pills
"
"Consumption of human drugs including but not limited to:
"
"Antihistamines
"
"Sleeping tablets
"
"Diet pills
"
"Heart pills
"
"Blood pressure pills
"
"Ibuprofen
"
"Acetaminophen
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and recent activities. Your veterinarian will perform a comprehensive physical exam on your dog, taking into account their health history and the onset of symptoms.
"
"She is also likely to recommend blood tests. Some drugs will affect the body quickly while others are more slow-acting, and this initial blood sample will act as a baseline to monitor progression or improvement.
"
"Diagnosis and treatment will be wholly dependent on the symptoms and information you are able to give to your veterinarian, as well as your dog's current behavior and the results from any tests your veterinarian conducts.
"
"Most importantly, do not induce vomiting in your dog, as this could cause further damage. Contact your veterinarian for guidance and next steps. 
"
"Always consult your veterinarian on the appropriate medication and the proper dosage for your dog. He or she will base this on your dog's breed, size and age. Make sure you keep all drugs and medications—for pets and people—in a safe place that is not accessible to your pet, preferably in a locked cabinet.
"
"Remember that pill bottles are child-proof, not dog-proof.

"Although many people believe dogs are natural swimmers, tragically this is often not the case. Some dogs will immediately go underwater and drown or nearly drown. Other dogs may be able to swim for a while, but soon grow tired and are unable to continue to paddle.
"
"Drowning is more common in dogs than in cats, and is usually seen in puppies under 4 months old. Dogs can easily fall into unfenced pools, ponds, bathtubs, or other bodies of water with steep sides and no way out. A near-drowning is more accurately called nonfatal drowning and occurs when a dog is submerged in water and survives for at least 24 hours.
"
"During drowning, carbon dioxide increases in the body, which triggers a dog to take a breath. This leads to aspirating water, which fills the alveoli, small sacs in the lungs responsible for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide). The water fills and collapses these sacs, leading to pneumonia, infection, decreased oxygenation, and organ damage.
"
"Water temperature, type of water (salt vs. fresh), any chemicals in the water, and the length of time a dog is underwater all play a part in the severity of damage. Once underwater, dogs only have minutes before brain damage, organ failure, and potential death ensue.
"
"Drowning is a medical emergency. If your dog falls into a body of water or is submerged under water for any length of time, seek emergency veterinary care immediately. Clinical signs can be delayed, so it is still critical for dogs that are seemingly acting normal to receive veterinary attention.
"
"Clinical signs of drowning mostly involve the respiratory system:
"
"Coughing with or without foamy, red saliva
"
"Respiratory distress
"
"Decreased body temperature 
"
"Blue gums indicative of cyanosis, or lack of oxygen
"
"Vomiting
"
"Loss of consciousness
"
"Apnea, or not breathing
"
"Any place with a significant amount of water can cause dogs to drown. Unmonitored pets around pools or ponds without an easy exit account for most dog drownings. Bodies of water with thin ice also result in frequent drownings and hypothermia in dogs that fall through accidentally.
"
"While inadequate safety precautions, owner negligence, and intentional animal abuse are the main causes of drowning in pets, it is also important to recognize that even everyday household items are drowning hazards. Shallow plastic children’s pools, bathtubs, and even water buckets are potentially dangerous.
"
"Any water that is deep enough to submerge the nose and mouth can drown an animal that has suffered from head trauma, seizures, hypoglycemic episodes, cardiac arrhythmias and fainting, or clots — anything that can cause a temporary lack of consciousness.
"
"A term called “dry drowning” was once used to describe drowning events that involve the animal’s airway closing during or after entry into the water. Animals believed to have “dry drowned” have little water in their lungs.
"
"However, recent studies have shown this is exceedingly rare and is not appropriate to call a form of drowning. Most dogs believed to have “dry drowned’ were not breathing prior to submersion into water due to some other issue, such as trauma, blood clot, low blood sugar, or heart issues.
"
"Drowning is, unfortunately, an easy diagnosis in dogs, as they are usually recovered from water by their pet parents and brought to the hospital. However, the complications of near-drowning can be more difficult to diagnose and require extensive care by a veterinary staff.
"
"After a near-drowning episode, veterinarians will monitor the following parameters and tests including:
"
"Blood chemistry, complete blood count, and urinalysis to monitor organ function, electrolytes, and cellular damage.
"
"Blood gas testing to show levels of oxygenation and other abnormalities.
"
"X-rays of the chest to look for fluid and pneumonia. Radiographic changes may not be visible until a day or two after the event.
"
"ECG monitoring to watch for cardiac arrhythmias.
"
"Endotracheal or transtracheal wash of the fluid in the lungs to identify any infectious agents.
"
"Advanced imaging, such as CT or MRI of the brain in cases of brain damage.
"
"Prompt veterinary care is critical following a near-drowning incident, but treatment should start immediately.
If your dog is unconscious, you can institute mouth-to-muzzle resuscitation or even CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) if needed. Remove any objects from the airway and use towels to dry off and warm your dog, as hypothermia (decreased body temperature) is a common complication.
"
"Once at the veterinary hospital, dogs that have had a near-drowning event will be placed on oxygen supplementation to help them breathe. This may be by a mask, a cage, or even full intubation in severe cases. An intravenous catheter will allow the veterinarian to more easily deliver fluids and medications.
"
"The degree of severity, based on clinical signs and diagnostic testing results, will determine additional treatments such as:
"
"Cardiac drugs
"
"Antibiotics
"
"Treatments for brain swelling
"
"Anti-cough medications
"
"Recovery and prognosis are closely related to the amount of time spent underwater, and the amount of time before a dog begins receiving veterinary care. Most dogs that are conscious when arriving at the veterinary hospital have a good prognosis if there are no complications. Recovery may take days to weeks, depending on the severity. Most common complicating factors and long-term concerns include:
"
"Pneumonia
"
"Fluid in the lungs
"
"Gastrointestinal issues like bleeding, vomiting, and diarrhea
"
"Kidney injury
"
"Permanent brain damage
"
"Coagulation abnormalities
"
"Central diabetes insipidus (a disease that causes abnormal urination and thirst)
"
"Many dogs recover completely from a near-drowning episode, with a normal life expectancy.
"
"Any dog who had a near-drowning episode should be evaluated by a veterinarian, even if they are currently showing symptoms or not.
"
"Treatment primarily involves supplementing oxygen, increasing body temperature, and correcting any organ or blood dysfunction.
"
"Dogs can survive if they receive prompt veterinary care and have few complications.

"Most pet parents have been woken up at one time or another because their pup has been shaking his head or scratching at his ears.
"
"However, in some cases, what may seem like a harmless itch could be a sign of something more serious.
"
"If left untreated, this could lead to discomfort, pain and even hearing loss.
"
"Head shaking in dogs and scratching at the ears are often related but can have different causes. 
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Head shaking in dogs allows pups to get something out of their ears that shouldn’t be there.
"
"When dogs feel itchiness or irritation in their ears, they instinctively shake their heads.
"
"While this can solve the problem if the dog has some water, a piece of grass, or an insect in his ear, continued head shaking indicates that the irritation is ongoing and needs to be addressed by their vet.
"
"There are several reasons as to why dogs shake their head. These can include:
"
"Ear infections
"
"Allergies
"
"Presence of foreign objects
"
"Cancer
"
"Auto-immune diseases
"
"Certain types of neurologic conditions
"
"Regardless of cause, if excessive or repetitive, an examination by your veterinarian is warranted.
"
"Each cause has a different treatment, and it’s only through physical examination and testing that proper treatment can be determined.
"
"The most frequently diagnosed health problem that causes excessive head shaking dogs is an ear infection.
"
"Ear infections tend to be itchy and produce a lot of discharge and inflammation, all of which make dogs want to shake their heads.
"
"If you lift up the flap of your dog’s ear(s) and see redness, swelling, or discharge, an infection is likely.
"
"Ear mite infestations can cause similar symptoms, but they are not as common as yeast or bacterial infections in dogs (particularly adult dogs).
"
"Keep in mind that infections may occur deep within a dog’s ear, so an infection may be present even if you don’t see obvious signs of one.
"
"Allergies are another common problem that leads to head shaking in dogs.
"
"Individuals can be allergic to ingredients in their food or triggers in their environment (pollen, mold spores, dust or storage mites, etc.).
"
"Symptoms of allergies in dogs typically include some combination of:
"
"Itchy skin
"
"Hair loss
"
"Recurrent skin and ear infections
"
"Scratching at the ears
"
"Head shaking
"
"Chewing of the feet
"
"Rubbing at the face
"
"Head shaking that occurs because of water getting into the ears is easily prevented by placing cotton balls (or half a cotton ball for small breeds) in the dog’s ears prior to bathing or swimming.
"
"Avoid spraying or dumping water directly on your dog’s head during a bath.
"
"Instead, bathe his body from the neck down and wipe down his face and ears with a damp washcloth.
"
"If your dog won’t stand for cotton balls in his ears while swimming, consider using an ear band or cleaning his ears with a drying solution post-swim.
"
"Your veterinarian can recommend a safe and effective product based on your dog’s particular needs.
"
"Other health conditions that can make dogs excessively shake their heads include foreign objects that become lodged in the ear canal, inflammatory diseases, or even neurologic disorders causing head tremors. These are easily confused with head shaking.
"
"If your dog has recurrent ear infections, your veterinarian will look for an underlying cause, such as allergies, anatomical abnormalities, or hypothyroidism.
"
"Diagnosing and treating the reason behind a dog’s head shaking is important. Not only because it's a symptom of a potentially serious problem, but because continued or vigorous head shaking can lead to ruptured blood vessels within a dog’s ear flap. 
"
"Dogs enjoy playing outside and getting dirty, but unfortunately, that can mean that dirt, debris and other material such as plant debris, seeds, burrs, and insects can get into the ears causing irritation and head shaking.
"
"Certain inflammatory conditions and auto-immune diseases like pemphigus can lead to itching, scratching and shaking of the head. 
"
"Usually, these conditions are accompanied by other symptoms like crusts and ulcers and redness of other parts of the body. 
"
"These conditions can be challenging to diagnose as often require ruling out other medical conditions as well as through a biopsy of the skin. 
"
"Certain neurologic diseases can lead to head shaking, or something that looks very similar to shaking like tremors or head bobbing.
"
"The main difference between head shaking and head tremors is that shaking is a voluntary action whereas tremors are not. 
"
"Tremors, as a neurological disease, are often accompanied by other symptoms as well, such as trouble walking, falling over, or even seizures. 
"
"Videography can be useful in determining the difference and a consultation with a veterinary neurologist may be warranted for further testing and treatment.
"
"If your dog is shaking his head repeatedly and the behavior does not stop over the course of a day or so, it’s time to make an appointment with your veterinarian.
"
"Your veterinarian will typically perform an otoscopic examination. During this exam, your vet will look down into your pup's ear to determine if water, dirt or debris or foreign objects are present.
"
"If excessive debris is present, then cleaning the ears may be necessary. Sedation may be required if your dog is uncomfortable or in pain. 
"
"If an ear infection is suspected, a sample may be swabbed and looked under the microscope for signs of bacteria and/or yeast. 
"
"If a food allergy or intolerance is suspected, then performing a food trial may be necessary.
"
"this involves putting a dog on a diet that contains a single carbohydrate (such as rice or potato) and single source of protein that has never been fed to the dog before (like duck or venison) or that has been hydrolyzed (broken down into tiny, non-allergenic pieces).
"
"The dog must eat only this food for a month or two. If the symptoms disappear or at least significantly improve, a food allergy is likely.
"
"Environmental allergies are best diagnosed through intradermal skin testing, but blood testing is a reasonable option for some dogs.

"Tumors occur when a cell continues to multiply out of control instead of following the natural cycle that ends in cell death. There are two broad categories of tumors: benign and malignant.
"
"Benign tumors lack the ability to spread or invade other healthy tissue. Although they may need medical attention, these are not cancerous.
"
"Malignant tumors, or cancers, spread to other organs and tissues in a process called metastasis. Depending on the type of tumor and how aggressive it is, cancers can pose serious health risks for your dog. To determine how dangerous a tumor is, the best place to start is with a vet visit. 
"
"Although cancer can occur in many organs and tissues, the following are the most common types of tumors in dogs. 
"
"Mast cell tumors are malignant tumors that occur in the mast cells in a dog’s skin. Normal mast cells are a type of immune system cell. They play a role in allergic reactions, such as hives and bug bites.
"
"Mast cell tumors may look like a lot of different things, including a simple pimple or cyst. They can also mimic benign tumors such as lipomas.

"Just like humans require doctor appointments during pregnancy, dogs also require veterinary care before, during, and after they become pregnant. 
"
"This guide will help you prepare a whelping (birthing) area, what to feed pregnant dogs, what to expect during the birthing process, and how to provide postpartum care for your dog.
"
"Health Tools
"
"Lymphoma is a malignant cancer that arises from white blood cells called lymphocytes. Normal lymphocytes are an important part of a dog's immune system.
"
"A classic sign of lymphoma is large, firm lymph nodes, usually found around the jaw, in front of the shoulder, or in the back of the knees. Dogs with lymphoma can also be lethargic or lack interest in food.
"
"Lipomas are benign growths arising from fat cells. They are typically found in subcutaneous fat (the fatty layer just under a dog’s skin). The malignant form of this tumor is called liposarcoma and is less common.
"
"Lipomas are extremely common and can sometimes get very large. They are usually a cosmetic issue (pet parents may not love the look of a lumpy, bumpy pup), but they can sometimes cause problems if they are in a bad location. For example, a large lipoma located under a dog’s leg can cause trouble walking.
"
"Osteosarcoma is a type of malignant cancer that arises from bone cells. Osteosarcomas are often painful and can result in bone fractures, limb swelling, and lameness.
"
"These benign tumors arise from histiocytes in the skin. Histiocytes are a type of immune system cell that helps fight infection. They will frequently regress and resolve on their own within a few weeks. Sometimes they can become flat, ulcerated, or red across the top, which has earned them the nickname ""button tumors.""
"
"Histiocytoma is common in young dogs (typically less than 2 years of age).
"
"Hemangiosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the cells that line blood vessels. They can pop up anywhere but are most common in a dog’s spleen, heart, and skin.
"
"These tumors are often diagnosed when they rupture, which is an emergency situation that results in internal bleeding.
"
"Melanoma is a type of malignant tumor that arises from pigment-carrying cells in the skin called melanocytes. Melanomas in dogs can often be pink or non-pigmented. They can also be flat rather than raised.
"
"Most melanomas in dogs occur in the oral cavity (e.g., oral melanoma) but can also be found in the eye, nail bed, or skin.
"
"Oral melanomas are melanomas that grow in a dog’s mouth. They are the most common type of oral tumor in dogs, followed by fibrosarcoma and squamous cell carcinoma.
"
"These tumors can be raised or flat and darkly pigmented or pink. You may see them on your dog or you may notice that your dog has bad breath, which is a symptom. They can also be found in routine exams by your veterinarian.
"
"Oral melanomas are highly malignant and have often already spread once they are found.
"
"Papillomas, also called warts, are benign tumors caused by the canine papillomavirus. The virus is shared via contact from one dog to another. They are common in dogs that play in doggy playgroups, dog parks, or daycares and often occur on the lips, tongue, throat, or gums, although they may appear in other locations as well.
"
"This virus is species-specific and cannot infect you or any other type of animal in your house. Papillomas will typically resolve on their own within a few weeks.
"
"Mammary gland carcinomas are tumors that arise from the mammary or breast tissue of dogs. These tumors most frequently occur in dogs that are not spayed or were spayed after their second heat cycle.
"
"About 50% of mammary gland carcinomas are benign when they are discovered, but this determination can only be made by a pathologist after removal.
"
"Thyroid carcinomas are tumors that arise from thyroid cells in the thyroid gland, which is located in a dog’s throat.
"
"These tumors can be diagnosed by finding a swelling under the skin but are sadly often only found when evidence of spread is noted in other organs.

"
"In the first few weeks, you may not notice any changes in your dog's behavior. Some pregnant dogs will seem more tired, some may vomit, and some may eat less.
"
"You may notice that your dog is gaining weight and her mammary glands are becoming more prominent.
"
"It’s important to note that mammary development and color changes can also occur in non-pregnant female dogs during this time because of normal hormone changes.
"
"Symptoms a dog might experience throughout her pregnancy include:
"
"One to two weeks: Your dog may be asymptomatic or have intermittent decreased appetite and occasional vomiting; may be more tired than usual.
"
"Three to five weeks: Your dog may display more affectionate behavior towards you; noticeable weight gain with increased appetite; may become less active; develop clear vulvar discharge and mammary gland development.
"
"Six weeks: Continuation of previous weeks with a more noticeable change in the abdomen and mammary glands becoming bigger and firmer. 
"
"Seven to eight weeks: Nesting behavior may be exhibited by your pup, such as dragging blankets to a safe place and rearranging pillows; mammary glands continue to enlarge and may produce milk; abdomen has increased in size.
"
"Nine weeks: Impending birth; your dog's temperature may drop; she may appear restless.
"
"Dog pregnancy can only be confirmed by a veterinarian. Methods of confirming pregnancy in dogs include:
"
"A dog pregnancy ultrasound, which should be done around day twenty-five to twenty-eight of the pregnancy.
"
"Abdominal X-rays, which can be done on day 45.
"
"There are available blood tests to determine pregnancy; however, they are inaccurate and not a valid method for determining pregnancy.
"
"Some vets may also be able to palpate (feel) a dog's abdomen to determine pregnancy, but this, too, is unreliable and without experience, can be unsafe for developing fetuses.
"
"Whether or not a female dog is pregnant, her hormones after a heat cycle are remarkably similar.
"
"Because of these hormones, false pregnancy (or pseudopregnancy) allows nonpregnant dogs to show symptoms such as lactation and maternal behavior changes.
"
"These changes are hormone-related and typically go away on their own with little or no medical intervention.
"
"Dogs experiencing pseudopregnancy rarely require medical treatment related to the condition, but side effects or complications are possible, and it is essential to talk to your veterinarian.
"
"If your dog isn’t going to be bred, spaying her can prevent future episodes.
"
"A dog’s pregnancy length (or gestation period) is around 63 days from ovulation, or just over two months.
"
"Ovulation is determined by monitoring the hormones progesterone and luteinizing hormone (LH).
"
"Reproduction veterinarians commonly perform this testing.
"
"By determining the day of ovulation, a veterinarian can specify a highly accurate due date down to a three-day window.
"
"If ovulation timing is not performed, a dog's ovulation date is largely unknown, and the due date may range from 58 to 68 days from the time of breeding.
"
"The symptoms of a tumor vary based on the type of tumor, location, and whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
"
"Tumors in the brain may cause seizures, changes in behavior, or circling. Mast cell tumors have symptoms related to histamine release: swelling, bleeding or difficulty clotting, and vomiting. Tumors associated with the liver can cause increased liver values on lab work.
"
"Some types of cancers have symptoms or changes associated with them, called paraneoplastic syndrome. Paraneoplastic syndrome is caused when tumors excrete hormones or hormone-like substances, or when the dog’s immune system reacts to the tumor and causes symptoms not related to the cancer.
"
"Paraneoplastic syndrome can show up on lab work and in noticeable physical changes in your dog. These symptoms may be the first indication that cancer is present. Symptoms can include altered reflexes, weakness, and partial paralysis, among others. For example, elevated calcium levels are associated with lymphosarcoma. You may notice your dog drinking more water than normal, or sometimes the elevation can be found on routine lab work.
"
"Some tumors consume blood cells and can be associated with anemias (low red blood cells), low white blood cells, and/or low platelets. Others can cause the opposite.
"
"The cause of cancer in dogs can be complex. Ultimately, cancer is the result of damage to the cells of the body.
"
"Cells grow, divide, perform their job, and ultimately die and are replaced by new cells to keep the body going. However, sometimes the DNA within the cell can become damaged, causing a cell to mutate or divide incorrectly. The body has a lot of checks and balances to correct or destroy mutated cells, but if a mutated cell is left in the body it may continue to grow into a tumor or cancer.
"
"Damage to the cells may be triggered by many factors, or more likely a combination of factors. Here are some possible contributing factors:
"
"Genetics: Some types of tumors occur more frequently in certain breeds, such as Golden Retrievers, Boxers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and Rottweilers. This suggests a possible hereditary or genetic component, but more research is needed to better define which dogs are at risk of developing specific cancers.
"
"Age: Cancer occurs more frequently in older pets. The exact link between cancer and age is not fully understood, but it’s believed to be linked to a weakening immune system as pets age. As bodies age, it becomes more likely that a mutated cell will get past the body’s defense mechanisms and result in cancer. 
"
"Environment: Environmental hazards or chemicals can increase the risk of cancer in people—and the pets that live with them. Some examples include a variety of herbicides, pesticides, and other chemicals. Substances such as nickel, uranium, radiation, and asbestos have all been shown to be carcinogens. Prolonged exposure to the sun and UV light may result in higher cancer risks. 
"
"Ongoing research will hopefully provide more information and treatment options in the future.
"
"If you find a lump or bump on your dog, don’t panic. Schedule an appointment with your vet to get the growth checked out.
"
"It’s helpful to take note of when you first noticed it, where it’s located, if it has changed (such as gotten bigger or firmer), and whether or not your pet is licking or chewing at it. Measuring the mass with a tape measure or taking a photo may even be helpful. 
"
"Your veterinarian cannot diagnose a tumor is by looking at or feeling it. They won’t be able to give you a definitive diagnosis without sampling.
"
"Often, the first step to identifying what kind of growth your pet has is through a fine needle aspirate (FNA). This procedure involves inserting a needle into the mass to obtain a sample of the cells. The needle is typically the same size or even smaller than a needle used to draw blood on pets and is a relatively quick and easy procedure. 
"
"Your veterinarian will put the cells on a slide and likely send it to the laboratory for evaluation. This will hopefully give them an idea of what kind of growth your pet has. 
"
"If the tumor is on an internal organ such as the liver or spleen, a fine needle aspirate with ultrasound guidance may be recommended.
"
"The limitations of a fine needle aspirate are that the vet is only to get a sample of cells, so sometimes there isn’t enough information for the pathologist at the laboratory to determine the type of growth. Also, if a cancer is diagnosed, the vet may need additional information to determine the best treatment options.
"
"If the fine needle aspirate was inconclusive if additional information about the tumor is needed, a biopsy may be suggested. A biopsy can be excisional (the entire tumor) or incisional (a small portion of the tumor). The procedure will typically require general anesthesia, but it can provide more information to help with diagnosis and can sometimes remove the tumor completely. 
"
"For tumors of the stomach, intestines or colon, the biopsy may be performed with an endoscope (a camera placed in the mouth or rectum). If the tumor is on an internal organ such as the liver or spleen and additional sampling is needed, a surgical procedure (exploratory laparotomy) may be performed.
"
"Canine tumors are staged somewhat differently than human tumors. Depending on the type of tumor, they may be staged numerically with Roman numbers ranging from 0 to IV. A higher number means the cancer has spread further. Other types of tumors are graded differently.
"
"Different types of cancer have different treatments. The treatment recommended for a dog’s tumor depends on several factors:
"
"How aggressive you want to be with treatment
"
"A veterinarian should examine the female dog before breeding to determine physical health and fitness for pregnancy.
"
"The pregnant mother should again be examined by a veterinarian in the middle and end of pregnancy for pregnancy diagnosis, health tests, and planning for whelping.
"
"There are four different stages of dog pregnancy ending with post-partum care and lactation, but a dog can’t get pregnant without first going through a heat cycle. 
"
"Most dogs only have one to two heat cycles per year and can last anywhere from a couple of days to twenty days.
"
"The first trimester of pregnancy lasts about a month wherein the feti are forming, but you may not notice any physical changes other than a more affectionate dog or a dog with an increased appetite.
"
"The second trimester of pregnancy starts around the second month, most notably witnessing the physical changes to the mother with weight gain, decreased activity, increased appetite and nesting behavior.  The feti are starting to resemble pups.
"
"The third trimester of pregnancy is short and consists of labor.  The mother’s body temperature usually drops below 100 F. She may appear restless, and puppies are born.
"
"The fourth stage of dog pregnancy involves providing adequate postpartum care to the mother.
"
"As a pet parent, you must ensure your pup has recovered uneventfully from giving birth and provide her with enough calories to produce adequate milk to feed her puppies. 
"
"ADVERTISEMENT
"
"Most pregnancies occur uneventfully and without much intervention from the pet parents.
"
"However, if your dog is expecting, there are several things you can do to comfort for her and ensure a safe and healthy delivery.
"
"Regular exercise is helpful for pregnant dogs, but excessive exercise or rough play with other dogs should be avoided. 
"
"It’s best for the mother to be of an ideal body weight prior to becoming pregnant as obesity can cause complications. 
"
"Towards the end of her pregnancy, your pup should be restricted from encountering other dogs to minimize disease transmission, which would mean keeping her restricted to her home and backyard only. 
"
"Try feeding puzzles or a KONG® filled with veterinary-approved treats or snacks to provide mental stimulation and decrease boredom. 
"
"Your dog should have a fresh stool sample checked by your veterinarian during pregnancy, as intestinal parasites can spread to the puppies both in utero (in the womb) and during nursing.
"
"Do not use over-the-counter dewormers for your pregnant or nursing dog, as some of these could be dangerous.
"
"Instead, your veterinarian can prescribe the appropriate medication if her stool sample shows a parasitic infection.
"
"Pregnant female dogs should not have vaccinations. Make sure your dog is up-to-date on her vaccines and flea, tick, and heartworm prevention before she becomes pregnant.
"
"Newborn puppies are born without an immune system. They rely on their first 24 hours of nursing to receive protective antibodies through the mother's first milk, called colostrum.
"
"To best protect puppies, the mother should have high antibody levels to pass on. This is why you must make sure she is appropriately vaccinated prior to becoming pregnant.
"
"Talk to your vet at your pre-breeding exam to determine vaccination status.
"
"Whether the tumor is one that typically spreads to other organs or stays locally invasive
"
"How advanced or large the tumor is (the stage)
"
"How serious the tumor-related symptoms are
"
"Treatment options include surgical removal, radiation, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy.
"
"Some types of dog tumors can be cured. These are usually tumors that are locally invasive and can be completely removed surgically.
"
"Types of cancer that spread or metastasize to other parts of your dog’s body can be managed with treatment but are, unfortunately, not usually curable.
"
"The good news is that cancer treatment in dogs is often well tolerated with minimal side effects. For example, chemotherapy in dogs does not typically cause hair loss and has only mild gastrointestinal side effects. You can even administer some chemotherapeutic drugs at home, which decreases stress for your pet.
"
"When your pet is diagnosed with cancer, it’s best to get as much information as possible before you start making decisions. A consult with a veterinary oncologist can help provide answers around your dog’s possible outcomes and what to expect. They can explain treatment options in terms of what each one means as far as longevity and quality of life for your pet.
"
"Even if you ultimately choose not to proceed with chemotherapy or radiation, the more knowledge you are equipped with, the more at peace you will be with your decisions.
"
"A cyst and a tumor are differentiated by a fine needle aspirate or biopsy. Cysts are usually filled with fluid or waxy debris, whereas tumors are usually more solid.
"
"Mast cell tumors that are low-grade may be present for years without being detected. Mast cell tumors can look like just about any other type of tumor, so a fine needle aspirate is needed to help diagnose them.
"
"High-grade mast cell tumors can spread, invade healthy tissue, and may be fatal in the long term. The only way to determine a high-grade versus a low-grade mast cell tumor is through removal and testing with a pathologist.
"
"Tumors can present in lots of different ways on your dog: a lump or bump on the skin, a change in coloration, or even a change in the consistency of the skin. Tumors are frequently found on routine physical exam by your veterinarian, which is one of the many reasons you should have your dog checked by the vet regularly. The only way to determine whether a mass is benign or malignant is to take a sample of the tumor for testing.
"
"Cancerous or malignant tumors can be hard or soft. The feel of a mass and whether it bothers your dog has little to do with whether it is cancerous or not.
"
"The only sure way to determine whether a tumor is a fatty tumor (lipoma) or something else is with a fine needle aspirate or biopsy. Lipomas are very common in dogs, and while it can be tempting to diagnose them based on feel, this can end up missing a more dangerous diagnosis. Any new lump or bump on your dog should be checked by your veterinarian.
"
"Skin tumors in dogs can come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. The bumps vets get more concerned about are ones that are in the skin layer versus on top of it like a skin tag or wart-like growth common in older dogs.

"
"Feeding your pup her regular diet for the first two thirds of pregnancy is usually sufficient.
"
"Towards her last trimester, feeding a high-quality diet designed for growth and development—such as a puppy formula—is often best. This is due to the high demand on her body’s nutrient stores during this time frame. 
"
"Calorie requirements generally increase about day 40 and continue to increase about 10% each additional week.
"
"Her diet should be re-evaluated weekly to ensure adequate food is given. 
"
"It’s best to feed her smaller, more frequent meals as opposed to one or two larger meals. 
"
"Do not give your pregnant dog supplements, vitamins or mineral without veterinary approval. 
"
"Be sure to speak with your veterinarian about an individualized feeding plan for your pup.
"
"Many dogs give birth naturally.
"
"However, there are some breeds, such as English Bulldogs, French Bulldogs, and other brachycephalic (short-nosed dogs), that can’t typically go into labor naturally.
"
"Planned caesarian sections are often required in these cases, so working closely with your veterinarian is essential. 
"
"For those whelping naturally, near the end of your dog’s pregnancy you should create a quiet nesting area for the birthing process.
"
"This area should be warm and comfortable, away from foot traffic and loud noises, and your dog should be able to get in and out as she pleases while keeping the puppies contained.
"
"It’s also vital for the mother to be isolated from other dogs three weeks before labor and three weeks after delivery to prevent herpesvirus infection.
"
"This virus rarely causes disease in adult dogs but can be deadly for puppies.
"
"A pregnant dog’s temperature will drop well below 100 F within 24 hours of labor. 
"
"Start taking her temperature a few days before her due date. Rectal temperatures are the most accurate.
"
"There are several signs dog exhibit of impending parturition (giving birth) such as:
"
"Body temperature drops below 100 F
"
"Restlessness, exhibited by panting, digging, shivering
"
"Vaginal discharge
"
"Reclusive behavior or nesting
"
"Refusing to eat
"
"Vomiting
"
"Other signs that may occur, but are more subtle include:
"
"Relaxation of the hind end
"
"Change in appearance of the abdomen
"
"Mammary gland swelling
"
"There are three stages of dog labor.
"
"Contractions in the first stage can last up to 12 hours.
"
"Puppies are usually born 30 to 60 minutes apart, but the mother dog may take a break between puppies that can last up to two hours.
"
"Here’s what happens in each stage.
"
"The first stage is cervix relaxation and the start of intermittent contractions. However, you likely won’t notice these contractions.
"
"Your dog will act restless during this stage, travel in and out of the nesting box, pant, dig, and sometimes even vomit. She will likely refuse food.
"
"This stage can last as long as 12 hours.
"
"The second stage of labor begins with stronger, more frequent uterine contractions that eventually lead to the birth of a puppy.
"
"Puppies are usually born every 30 to 60 minutes, with 10 to 15 minutes of hard straining.
"
"Expect some puppies to be born tail-first, as this is not abnormal for dogs.
"
"It’s normal for the mother to take a break during the whelping process, but it’s important to know when to be concerned and call your vet.
"
"Signs for concern include:
"
"If your dog has been hard straining for more than 30 minutes
"
"If she takes longer than a four-hour break
"
"If there are fetal membranes (sometimes appears as greenish discharge) in the birth canal without a puppy produced within 30 minutes
"
"If all puppies haven't been born within 24 hours
"
"If the mother seems to be in extreme pain
"
"The third stage of labor includes passing all the fetal membranes, or placenta.
"
"The membranes, also known as afterbirth, are greenish-black and should not have a foul odor.
"
"Membranes should pass within 15 minutes of each puppy.
"
"Therefore, dogs will alternate between stages two and three with each puppy produced.
"
"Puppies are born with a protective fetal membrane that the mother usually removes shortly after birth. 
"
"If she does not remove this sac, you must manually remove it to stimulate the puppy to breathe.
"
"Break the sac, wipe away fluid from the puppy’s nostrils, open the mouth with the head facing down and wipe off any remaining fluids.
"
"Next, stimulate the puppy to breathe by stroking its body firmly with a towel. Do not swing the puppy.
"
"If the umbilical cord is not cut during birth or by the mother, you may need to cut it.
"
"Do not pull on the cord, as this may cause damage to the puppy’s organs.
"
"Instead, break it about 1 to 2 inches from the puppy’s body, tearing it gently with your first two fingers and thumb.
"
"You may also want to purchase medical instruments—such as clamps and scissors—before the birth to assist in this process.
"
"If you are unsure how to complete this process or have any concerns, contact your veterinarian immediately.
"
"The average litter size varies widely depending on the breed.
"
"Larger dog breeds typically have larger litters. The average number of puppies in a litter is six to eight, but some large breed dogs have been known to give birth to more. 
"
"Smaller breeds may have one to five puppies.
"
"Dogs that only have one or two puppies may not go into labor on their own and may require a C-section.
"
"Singleton pregnancies (one-pup litters) and dog breeds that do not typically give birth naturally may need a planned C-section, which you should discuss ahead of time with your veterinarian. 
"
"Your veterinarian can take an X-ray in the last week of pregnancy to count how many puppies your dog is expecting.
"
"This clarity can help pet parents to prepare supplies and expectations.
"
"Difficulty giving birth (called dystocia) has several causes:
"
"Maternal age, size, breed and anatomy—abnormal conformations such as a narrowed pelvic canal, vaginal defects, and uterine malformation
"
"Large litter size which can cause prolonged labor
"
"Uterine inertia, or weak uterine contractions
"
"Gestational toxemia—insufficient nutrition, often seen with larger litter sizes
"
"Fetal death or congenital malformations
"
"Fetal malposition
"
"Singleton puppy, often too large to pass through the birth canal
"
"Uterine torsion
"
"Let’s look at tips that every pet parent should know when caring for their dog after labor.
"
"Your dog should be kept on a higher calorie (pregnancy or puppy) diet for as long as she is nursing her puppies.
"
"Make sure she always has food and fresh water readily available.
"
"Keep the mother dog and her puppies in a clean, quiet, low-traffic area of the house.
"
"If there is too much commotion around her, she may become stressed and neglect her puppies.
"
"Additionally, provide a safe space where she can rest away from her litter while still having easy access to them.
"
"Newborn puppies should nurse every one to two hours, so your dog will likely be with them constantly for the first week or two.
"
"If you think that your dog may not produce milk or isn’t letting the puppies nurse, contact your veterinarian.
"
"Medications and vaccines should be avoided while your dog is nursing unless approved by your veterinarian.
"
"If your dog becomes ill, call your veterinarian immediately and let them know that she is nursing so they can prescribe safe medications if needed.
"
"Additionally, contact your vet immediately if:
"
"Your dog stops eating
"
"Your dog is vomiting
"
"She becomes lethargic
"
"You notice redness and swelling in any of her mammary glands
"
"You notice excessive, foul smelling bloody vulvar discharge
"
"There is no benefit to female dogs in having a litter of puppies. It can be highly demanding on her body, and some conditions during pregnancy, delivery, and nursing can have fatal consequences.
"
"Talk to your veterinarian about spaying your dog when the time is right. Spaying is the only birth control for dogs.
"
"The cost of pregnancy in dogs can be very high.
"
"Giving a litter of puppies proper veterinary care adds up quickly, and emergency cesarean sections can cost thousands of dollars.
"
"Small-breed dogs can be spayed at a younger age, as early as 6 months old.
"
"Large and giant dog breed spays may be delayed.
"
"It’s also important to consider the risk of pyometra (infection in the uterus). The best way to prevent this serious and expensive medical condition is to have your dog spayed.
"
"In addition, spaying before the first heat cycle can also reduce the risk of mammary cancer in your dog.
"
"Your dog's diet should remain the same postpartum (puppy formula), albeit in larger quantities, upwards of two to three times the normal amount.
"
"Free choice feeding may be opted for during this time frame as an alternative. 
"
"Milk production and lactation consumes a lot of nutrients and if not properly fed, your dog could be at risk of developing eclampsia, or other life-threatening conditions.
"
"Additionally, her puppies may not receive adequate calories for growth. 
"
"Once puppies begin weaning and eat solid food (usually around 4 to 6 weeks old), your dog’s diet and the amount she needs will need to be slowly changed back to an adult formula. 
"
"This will also help slow down her milk production. 
"
"Here are some things to expect and what to watch for following the birth of the puppies.
"
"Vaginal discharge may last in small amounts for up to eight weeks after the puppies are born.
"
"The discharge will normally appear reddish-black because it consists mainly of old blood.
"
"If the discharge is overly bloody, has an odor, or looks like pus, your dog should be examined by her veterinarian immediately. 
"
"If the discharge slows down but suddenly becomes worse, this could also be a sign to have her examined.
"
"Continue taking your dog's temperature after whelping, as infections after birth are common.
"
"If her temperature is over 102.5 F or if she is acting sick, contact your veterinarian. 
"
"Eclampsia may occur during whelping and the weeks after giving birth.
"
"It’s caused by the inability of the mother’s body to keep up with the calcium demand of lactation.
"
"Eclampsia is usually seen in toy breeds, and calcium supplementation during pregnancy predisposes a dog to this condition.
"
"Dogs with this condition will experience restlessness, abnormal mothering behaviors, itching face/nose, muscle spasms, a stiff gait, and even seizures. 
"
"Consult your veterinarian as soon as possible if you see any of these behaviors, as eclampsia can be fatal.
"
"It is crucial to not supplement calcium during pregnancy, as it could have a counterintuitive and severe effect during lactation.
"
"Instead, talk to your veterinarian about calcium supplementation doses.
"
"Metritis, or inflammation of the uterus, can occur when a placenta is retained or some trauma occurs during delivery.
"
"Contact your veterinarian immediately if you see signs of:
"
"Fever
"
"Lack of appetite
"
"Pneumonia is irritation and inflammation within the lungs that results in the buildup of fluid within the air sacs. This compromises the normal exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide within the lungs, resulting in difficult breathing. Pneumonia can be caused by various reasons, including:
"
"Pneumonia ranges from mild symptoms that affect small parts of the lungs to complete respiratory distress and an inability to breathe normally. Many cases of pneumonia require veterinary intervention immediately and should be treated as an emergency. 
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Pneumonia causes many symptoms, ranging from mild to severe.  Most common symptoms include:
"
"Pneumonia has many origins, and often a dog can have multiple types of pneumonia at once. This happens most often with secondary bacterial infections.
"
"Aspiration pneumonia occurs when a dog breathes in substances like food or vomit. It is one of the more common types of pneumonia.
"
"The inhaled food material physically blocks air spaces and sets off an inflammatory cascade within the lungs. Stomach acids can also directly damage lung cells. All these factors combined create a perfect environment for a secondary bacterial infection. Some animals are at a higher risk for developing aspiration pneumonia due to factors such as:
"
"Odorous vaginal discharge
"
"Lack of interest in the puppies
"
"Lack of milk production
"
"Mastitis, or inflammation of the mammary tissues, occurs when the mammary glands become hard, red, and painful due to infection.
"
"The mother will likely be sore while nursing, but the puppies need to keep suckling to help reduce swelling and promote excretion of the infected material.
"
"It does not hurt puppies to nurse on these glands, even in the presence of infection, but the glands should be evaluated quickly.
"
"Contact your veterinarian if you are concerned that your dog may have developed mastitis, as your dog will likely need treatment.
"
"Agalactia occurs when the dog doesn’t produce milk. If the puppies are suckling well but not receiving any milk, it’s important to seek veterinary care during this time.
"
"The first milk, or colostrum, provides the puppies with the necessary nutrients and antibodies from the mother to help build up their natural immunity to infections.
"
"If they do not get these essential substances during the first 24 hours of life, they will require additional veterinary care and will likely not thrive.

"Bacterial pneumonia is common in dogs. Bacteria typically enters the lungs through aspiration or inhalation, but rarely spreads throughout the bloodstream. Most healthy adult animals do not acquire primary bacterial pneumonia. Puppies, seniors and immunocompromised dogs are more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia. Typically, this type of pneumonia is a secondary condition, or works in conjunction of a bigger respiratory issue involving multiple bacteria and viruses. Common bacteria found in dogs with pneumonia include:
"
"Many factors contribute to a dog acquiring bacterial pneumonia. Dogs may be at risk with the following conditions:
"
"These infections can involve more than one virus and may also be present with bacterial organisms. They spread primarily through inhalation and are typically highly contagious to other dogs. Dogs in shelters, long-term boarding, daycare or dog parks may be at a higher risk for viral pneumonia. Common organisms include:
"
"Fungal pneumonia is more common in the South and Southwest regions of the country. Dogs acquire fungal infections by inhaling fungus from contaminated soil or plants. Pets near construction or new homes, may be at an even higher risk. Common fungal pathogens include:
"
"Parasitic and protozoal pneumonia occurs when living parasites live and reproduce in a dog’s lungs. Dogs may acquire parasites through contaminated feces and, in the case of heartworm, through insect vectors like mosquitos. This type of pneumonia is uncommon in dogs and includes:
"
"Eosinophilic pneumonia occurs when the dog’s immune system causes a type of white blood cell (eosinophils) to flood the lungs. Respiratory tract irritants like spores, pollen or insect antigens may trigger this immune response.
"
"Inhalation pneumonia may occur because of breathing noxious fumes or gases, including chemicals and smoke. Toxic particles interfere with the body’s ability to process oxygen normally, while also affecting the normal mucus and clearance within the lungs. 
"
"Veterinarians use many diagnostics tests to diagnose pneumonia. Typically, they will start with listening to the lungs with a stethoscope. Fluid in the chest may sound like crackles, wheezes and pops. Occasionally, the lungs are only quieter than normal. This symptom, combined with coughing or difficulty breathing, may lead a veterinarian to recommend additional diagnostic tests.
"
"Radiograph
"
"Veterinarians use radiographs, or X-rays of the chest to diagnose pneumonia, and a specialized 3-view X-ray to help determine its severity. Fluid and inflammation look much different from air on X-rays, with gray, patchy or a hazy pattern. Pneumonia can affect one lung lobe or multiple lobes. Lungs can even collapse as fluid replaces the entirety of the air sacs.
"
"Blood Chemistry and Complete Blood Count (CBC)
"
"The complete blood count, or CBC, may show signs of inflammation and infection. The blood chemistry may show signs of sepsis in severe cases, as well as predisposing factors or reasons for vomiting.
"
"Pulse Oximetry and Blood-Gas Analysis
"
"Veterinarians use pulse oximetry and blood gas analysis to determine if the patient is receiving sufficient oxygen, and to confirm the presence of respiratory dysfunction. This is also an integral part of the follow-up and treatment monitoring process. Pulse oximetry, a small infrared light, is a non-invasive test that reads how much oxygen is present in the capillaries. Blood-gas analysis requires a special catheter to collect blood to analyze for oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH, among other things.
"
"Culture and Cytology
"
"Dogs with pneumonia may undergo procedures such as transtracheal washes, bronchoalveolar lavage and a bronchoscopy to obtain fluid samples from within the lungs. These procedures require special instruments designed to explore the respiratory tract and obtain the purest sample. Veterinarians can evaluate the samples under a microscope and look for cells and pathogenic organisms. Once cultured, veterinarians identify specific bacterial pathogens and then prescribe the best antibiotic therapy.
"
"Other Tests
"
"Veterinarians can use advanced imaging, such as MRI or CT to fully assess the extent of pneumonia and other risk factors. They may use other tests for infectious agents and parasites, including PCR, serology, etc. Blood cultures are rarely used, as a local culture typically yields good results. 
"
"Therapy depends on the type of pneumonia and underlying pathology, or other illnesses. The severity of the disease will also dictate the intensity of treatment. Mild cases of pneumonia can be managed on an outpatient basis with medications, rest and home care. Moderate to severe cases require hospitalization - often at emergency facilities - with 24/7 nursing care and special equipment.
"
"Antibiotics
"
"Veterinarians prescribe antibiotics to dogs with primary or secondary bacterial pneumonia. Most common antibiotics include Doxycycline, Fluoroquinolone and Amoxicillin-clavulanic Acid. Treatment length is typically long-term, sometimes more than a month. Frequent rechecks help determine how long the antibiotics must be taken.
"
"Oxygen Therapy
"
"For animals who cannot oxygenate sufficiently on room-air, they are placed on supplemental oxygen. This may be a nasal or face mask, but veterinarians most commonly utilize an oxygen cage. An oxygen cage is an enclosed environment where the oxygen can be manipulated from room air (20 percent oxygen) to 100 percent oxygen. This is typically the least stressful way to supply oxygen to dogs in respiratory distress, and indicates the dog’s level of illness.
"
"Fluid Therapy
"
"Dogs with pneumonia are typically dehydrated and require an intravenous catheter and fluid therapy to rehydrate. Dehydration impairs respiratory clearance and function, so this is especially important in cases of pneumonia.
"
"Nebulization and Coupage
"
"Nebulizers create a fine mist and allow a localized increase in humidity, like the moist environment of a bathroom when the shower is on. Most nebulizers use saline to increase hydration of the airway but can also add antibiotics. After a nebulization treatment, dogs with pneumonia may have coupage performed, which is a gentle yet firm tap around the chest. Together, nebulization and coupage help break apart and clear mucus and other cells trapped in the airways.
"
"Ventilation
"
"Severe cases of pneumonia require full sedation and a ventilator to breathe. This is typically done if a dog does not respond to initial oxygen therapy or is minimally unresponsive. This typically happens only in an intensive care unit.
"
"X-rays are typically taken every two to five days during the acute phase, and then every one to two  weeks (as needed) until complete resolution. X-rays should be monitored for recurrence every few months after full resolution. A veterinarian will want to recheck an exam as well as bloodwork within the first two weeks after an episode of pneumonia.
"
"Most veterinarians recommend the continuation of treatment for at least a week after resolution of clinical signs – both patient symptoms and X-ray evidence.
"
"Veterinarians do not typically recommend cough suppressants for dogs recovering from pneumonia. Coughing is the body’s natural way to remove the infection and fluid within the airways.
"
"Some forms of canine pneumonia, such as viral or bacterial components, are contagious to other dogs.
"
"The prognosis for canine pneumonia is typically very good, with early and aggressive veterinary treatment. Studies show approximately 77 to 94 percent of patients with bacterial pneumonia survive to discharge.
"
"Dogs with pneumonia are typically very sick, lethargic and act abnormally. If your pet is having difficulty or changes in breathing, contact your veterinarian or go directly to an emergency hospital for treatment.

"As a pet parent, it’s important to create a habit of checking your dog’s poop. Dog poop (or “stool”) can tell us a lot about a dog’s health. In fact, changes in color, consistency, and frequency of your dog’s poop can be one of the first signs of illness.
"
"One of the most concerning changes you may notice in your dog’s poop is the presence of blood. If your dog is pooping blood, it’s helpful to know what to do and when to seek treatment.
"
"The first thing your veterinarian will ask are questions aimed at figuring out what might have caused it.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Seeing blood in your dog’s poop is alarming, and it can be caused by several factors.
"
"Bloody poop in dogs can be a consequence of something affecting your pup’s digestive tract (this can occur anywhere in the stomach, small intestine, colon, or anal region).
"
"Common conditions affecting the digestive tract (GI tract) include inflammation that’s called gastroenteritis, or acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) when blood is also present.
"
"Either of these can occur when your dog has eaten something they shouldn't have, termed dietary indiscretion. This can include non-food items, such as:
"
"Bones
"
"Sticks
"
"Toys
"
"Toxins
"
"Garbage
"
"Bloody poop in dogs can also occur when dietary changes have been made, such as when a new food, treat, or chew toy is introduced, or when your dog has eaten another pet’s food or when fed a raw or uncooked diet.
"
"Other conditions that can affect the digestive tract, leading to bloody poop in dogs, include:
"
"Infections (bacteria or viruses such as salmonella or parvovirus)
"
"Parasites (intestinal worms, coccidia, giardia), which can be transmissible to people
"
"Cancer
"
"Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
"
"Bloody poop in dogs can also be seen with conditions “outside” the digestive tract. This may include issues that affect normal blood clotting, such as:
"
"Bleeding disorders
"
"Toxins like rodenticide poisoning
"
"Liver disease
"
"Kidney disease
"
"Diseases of the immune system, such as immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP)
"
"Hormonal disorders
"
"Cancer
"
"Other diseases or conditions that cause bloody poop in dogs include:
"
"Stress
"
"Addison’s disease
"
"Irritable bowel disease (IBD)
"
"Gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration
"
"Food allergies/intolerance
"
"Trauma
"
"Intussusception (folding of the intestines)
"
"Anal gland problems
"
"If your dog is passing blood in his stool and vomiting, see a veterinarian immediately.
"
"Loss of fluid through vomiting along with loss of blood and fluid in the stool can lead to serious and life-threatening dehydration. This can also be a sign of a more serious underlying disease.
"
"Bloody stool can appear in several different ways. The color and appearance of the blood helps determine which part of the digestive tract the blood is coming from.
"
"“Hematochezia” is the term used to describe when there is bright red blood in a dog’s poop. In this case, the blood is bright red because it is coming from the lower part of the digestive tract (colon or anus and rectum).
"
"It is also bright red because it has not gone through the entire digestive process and typically looks “fresh” when it exits the body.
"
"When hematochezia is seen, it often accompanies diarrhea and will have a red-tinged appearance. The dog will likely go to the bathroom with increased frequency and may have a larger volume of stool. The consistency can range from a soft, formed texture to completely liquid.
"
"Sometimes formed stool will also be covered in mucus, and the blood will appear to be on the outside of the poop. This also indicates an issue with the lower part of the digestive tract, like the colon.
"
" 
"
"In the case where blood comes from the upper part of the digestive tract (the stomach or small intestine), it will appear dark to almost black and tarry.
"
"Some pet parents are not aware that dark stool can mean the presence of blood. This is called melena.
"
"Melena in dogs can occur with any condition that affects the stomach or upper part of the intestine, including inflammation, ulcers, and cancer.
"
"With melena, a dog’s poop usually looks more solid.
"
"It’s also important to note that in some cases, you may see your dog pass only blood with no poop. If the stool is liquid, or the gut is empty, blood may be all that comes out.
"
"If your dog is pooping blood, the best thing to do is to call a veterinarian for advice. In some cases, a conversation over the phone can help determine whether your dog needs to be examined right away.
"
"There are some instances when at-home care may be appropriate.
"
"For instance, eating colored foods such as beets or red-dyed treats can give the false appearance of blood in a dog’s stool.
"
"Think about all the things your dog may have been exposed to or given in previous days. This will help you and your vet determine the next best steps.
"
"If your dog starts pooping blood and displays any of these symptoms, take him to the vet immediately:
"
"Lethargy or weakness
"
"Pale gums (white or pale pink instead of a normal salmon pink color)
"
"Vomiting
"
"Pushing to have a bowel movement and little to nothing comes out (tenesmus)
"
"Refusing food or water
"
"Your pup becomes unresponsive
"
"These symptoms could signify shock and a more serious disease.
"
"Your vet will want to perform a thorough physical examination which may include a rectal exam.
"
"During this exam, your vet will check your pup for tumors, foreign objects, and anal gland issues.
"
"They will also check your dog’s lymph nodes and will perform an abdominal palpation. They’ll look for pain, swelling, or abnormal organs.
"
"Additionally, your veterinarian may recommend the following diagnostics:
"
"Stool exam, which will look for abnormal bacteria and parasites. It can also verify blood is being passed in the stool.
"
"Giardia and parvo SNAP tests
"
"CPL or pancreatitis testing
"
"Routine blood work evaluating the extent of blood loss, hydration status, and organ failure
"
"X-rays and/or abdominal ultrasound, useful for detecting tumors and foreign objects
"
"Fecal culture
"
"Resting cortisol or endocrine tests looking for conditions like Addison’s disease and malabsorptive diseases
"
"Endoscopy or colonoscopy to visualize and biopsy the GI tract
"
"Because there are several reasons why a dog might poop blood, the treatment will depend on the underlying cause.
"
"In the case of simple digestive tract upset due to dietary changes or inflammation, a veterinarian may prescribe an easily digestible (bland) diet and medications to support your dog’s gut.
"
"Medications may include probiotics/prebiotics, antibiotics, and antacids.
"
"If your dog appears dehydrated, your vet may also recommend giving your dog fluids.
"
"In the case of mild dehydration, your vet may give fluids under the skin and send your dog home for further care.
"
"In more severe cases, intravenous (IV) fluid therapy may be required, along with hospitalization for monitoring and more intensive support.
"
"Recovery is variable and dependent on the underlying cause.
"
"However, with appropriate treatment and with any subsequent defecation, your dog’s stool should look more and more normal with less and less amounts of blood present.

"Dog mouth cancer usually affects older dogs but is diagnosed in younger dogs on rare occasions.
"
"Oral tumors in dogs are typically found on the roof of the mouth or around the gums, but they can be located anywhere in the mouth.
"
"They tend to grow very quickly—often involving the underlying bone—and some varieties readily spread to other areas of the body.
"
"Here are some symptoms you can look for, options for treatment and the life expectancy for dogs with mouth cancer.
"
"The most common types of oral cancers in dogs are melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and fibrosarcoma.
"
"They all produce similar symptoms, which generally include some combination of the following:
"
"Excessive drooling
"
"Bad breath (halitosis)
"
"Difficulty chewing (dysphagia) or drinking
"
"Blood coming from the mouth
"
"Oral pain
"
"Weight loss
"
"Loose teeth
"
"Peritonitis is a condition in which the membrane that lines abdominal cavity (called the peritoneum) becomes inflamed, often due to injury or infection. The peritoneum is a thin, watery lining that lubricates the abdominal organs (such as the stomach).  
"
"This can cause fluid to build up in the abdomen. Peritonitis can be a very serious and life-threatening condition in dogs and requires immediate treatment.  
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Symptoms of peritonitis vary widely and can be confused with symptoms caused by many other conditions. If your dog shows any of the following signs, bring them to your veterinarian immediately (especially if your dog exhibits two or more symptoms). 
"
"Abdominal pain is a very common symptom of peritonitis. Dogs may show abdominal pain by appearing in a “prayer” position (rear end up in the air while their front legs and head are lowered onto the floor).  Abdominal distension or bloating may also occur.  
"
"Other signs of illness include: 
"
"Vomiting, nausea, or refusing to eat 
"
"Diarrhea  
"
"If not, then you should contact your vet right away.
"
"Some dogs show improvement within 24 to 48 hours whereas others may be hospitalized for several days. 
"
"Some conditions will require lifelong medication and constant follow-up to ensure appropriate monitoring and mediciation response while others may require surgery or chemotherapy. 
"
"Humane euthanasia may be recommended for some dogs based on the prognosis or lack of response to treatment.
"
"Be sure to adhere to your veterinarian’s recommendations and follow-up schedule.
"
"If the loss of blood through the digestive tract is significant, or it’s combined with significant loss of fluid through vomiting or diarrhea, it can be life-threatening.
"
"Severe dehydration and loss of blood (leading to anemia) can lead to serious consequences for your pet.
"
"This can include shock, having difficulty breathing, internal organ damage, and death if it goes untreated.
"
"Check with a veterinarian if you are unsure of the status of your dog.
"
"This is a common question—but with a not-so-straightforward answer. There are several reasons why your dog may be pooping blood, from stress to diet to infection to cancer.
"
"Even though he is acting normally, diseases can change and worsen over time, and he should be examined by a vet.
"
"Bright red blood (hematochezia) and mucus are often accompanied by diarrhea and typically are a symptom of a disease affecting the colon such as parasites, infections or related to diet.
"
"If your dog is actively bleeding from his rectum, he should be examined by a veterinarian right away. 
"
"The cause is usually related to his colon or rectum—verify that he hasn’t eaten anything unusual or inappropriate, had a recent change in diet, or undergone a recent stressful event or trauma.
"
"Speak with your veterinarian as he may require additional tests so appropriate treatment can be implemented.

"Visible mass in the mouth
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes in the neck (occasionally)
"
"Swollen or deformed areas on the face
"
"In most cases, there is no identifiable cause for cancer of the mouth in dogs.
"
"As part of a thorough physical examination, your veterinarian will look inside your dog's mouth for tumors or other abnormalities. This may require sedation.
"
"Bloodwork and a urinalysis will provide insight about your dog’s overall health status and are essential to planning appropriate treatment.
"
"X-ray images of your dog's chest may show whether a growth in the mouth has spread to the chest, and a CT scan or MRI of your dog's mouth may be recommended to determine how invasive the tumor.
"
"A tissue biopsy will be taken to determine which kind of cancer is present.
"
"In some cases, the entire visible mass can be removed and sent off for identification, but at other times, it’s best to remove just a small piece of the tumor to better plan for future surgery and other necessary treatments.
"
"The veterinarian may also want to take a small sample from the lymph nodes to determine whether there are cancerous cells there.
"
"Surgery is often the treatment of choice for dog mouth cancer, but it may not lead to a cure because the tumor often has already spread to other parts of the body.
"
"A large amount of bone and tissue surrounding the tumor may also have to be removed to eliminate the majority of cancerous cells at the site. Sometimes this means that part of the jaw must be removed, but most dogs do well even after such a radical surgery.
"
"Your veterinarian may recommend radiation therapy to treat tumors that can’t be completely removed with surgery alone.
"
"Oral cancers in dogs tend not to respond well to chemotherapy, but a form of immunotherapy is available for oral melanomas in dogs.
"
"Soft foods, hand-feeding or a feeding tube may be necessary for dogs with oral tumors and after oral surgery or radiation therapy.
"
"If part of the jaw has been removed, there may be some difficulty with eating and drinking afterward until your dog has learned to compensate for the loss of teeth and bone.
"
"Your veterinarian will also recommend pain relievers, antibiotics and/or any other forms of treatment necessary to maintain your dog’s quality of life for as long as possible.
"
"The life expectancy of dogs with mouth cancer varies based on the type of tumor involved, how advanced it is at the time of diagnosis and other health factors.
"
"If a tumor is caught early when it can be completely removed, surgery may be curative. However, oral tumors in dogs are often not diagnosed until after they have already metastasized.
"
"With appropriate treatment, many of these dogs live for around 6-12 months after diagnosis, at which point euthanizing a pet becomes the most humane option available.

"Peritonitis occurs when the abdominal cavity becomes injured and inflamed, so the condition has many possible causes. For example, peritonitis can occur when a dog suffers a penetrating injury or blunt trauma to the abdomen (such as wounds sustained from stabbing or kicking).  
"
"Intestinal blockages caused by swallowing foreign objects can also lead to peritonitis. 
"
"Other possible causes include: 
"
"Ruptured bladder, uterus, or gall bladder 
"
"Tears in surgical sites 
"
"Ulcers (ulcer-related holes in the stomach lining can be caused by medication like non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or NSAIDs) 
"
"Abdominal tumors 
"
"Disorders of other internal organs (e.g., heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, or pancreas) 
"
"Twisted stomach or bloat 
"
"Liver inflammation (hepatitis) 
"
"Less frequently, peritonitis can be caused by blood-borne infection (e.g., bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic). Rarely, the cause of the peritonitis is unknown or cannot be determined.   
"
"Although not inherited, some breeds have a higher likelihood of developing conditions that lead to peritonitis. For example, young large-breed dogs such as Labrador Retrievers may be more likely to swallow a foreign object (such as a sock or underwear), causing an intestinal blockage and rupture that results in peritonitis.  
"
"On the other hand, breeds like miniature Schnauzers are more prone to pancreatitis, which also can lead to peritonitis. Finally, giant breed dogs such as Great Danes will be more likely to develop “twisted” stomach” (gastric dilatation and volvulus).   
"
"Diagnosing peritonitis begins with a physical examination to check for abdominal pain and fever. Your veterinarian will ask about your dog’s medical history, including recent surgical procedures and current medications (particularly NSAIDs). 
"
"You will also be asked about potential trauma and anything your dog might have swallowed. Other tests commonly used to investigate peritonitis include: 
"
"A blood test to assess overall organ function, white blood cell count and dehydration 
"
"Abdominal x-rays to look for fluid within the abdomen as well as intestinal blockage or masses 
"
"Abdominal ultrasound to confirm the presence of fluid in the abdomen 
"
"A fluid sample drawn from a needle (abdominocentesis) to check for inflammatory cells and bacteria 
"
"If the test results indicate peritonitis, your dog will need to be hospitalized and be put on IV fluids. Medication will be given to treat symptoms of nausea, pain, and diarrhea. Antibiotics will also likely be an important part of your pet’s care.   
"
"Emergency surgery is usually required to repair the underlying cause of the inflammation, such as a rupture, wound, or abscess. In rare cases where the specific cause of the peritonitis cannot be identified, the surgeon will rinse the abdomen with sterile saline.

"Diagnosing and treating peritonitis as soon as possible is key to achieving the best outcome and minimizing complications. Recovering from this serious condition often requires 3 to 5 days (and sometimes more) following surgery.  
"
"During this time, IV fluids, antibiotics, and nutritional support are required. Unfortunately, even with intensive support the survival rate is about 50%. If sepsis has set in, the survival rate is lower. 
"
"Your veterinarian will discharge your dog when she is fever-free and can eat without throwing up. Expect a full recovery to take 10-14 days of rest with minimal activity.  
"
"Depending on what caused the peritonitis in the first place, your dog can make a complete recovery and resume normal activity. For example, if peritonitis was caused by swallowing a foreign object, then it will be important to prevent a future occurrence.  
"
"If the peritonitis was the result of an underlying issue, such as a bowel rupture caused by a tumor, then more extensive tests are required to diagnose and treat the cause. 
"
"Peritonitis in dogs is treatable. However, it is a very serious condition that can quickly become life-threatening and requires immediate, intensive veterinary care, including hospitalization and often surgery.
"
"The most common cause of peritonitis in dogs is a hole (perforation) in an internal organ, which can occur from a penetrating abdominal wound, ruptured intestines (from blockage or ulceration), splitting open (dehiscence) of surgical site(s), or erosion of stomach or intestines from a tumor. This can lead to a serious and life-threatening bacterial infection (sepsis) and requires immediately veterinary care.

"An intestinal blockage or a bowel obstruction in dogs, is a partial or complete blockage of the intestines that stops solid foods or liquids from passing through. This can prevent absorption of water and nutrients, which can quickly cause the dog to become dehydrated and have imbalanced electrolytes (minerals that are important for the body to function).  
"
"Keep in mind, bowel obstruction and intestinal blockage can be used interchangeably when referring to a dog intestinal blockage.
"
"An intestinal blockage in dogs can damage the intestines by pressing on the intestinal wall and causing the tissue to die (necrosis) or break (bowel rupture or perforation).
"
"If you believe your dog swallowed something they shouldn’t have, or is experiencing any signs related to a bowl obstruction, contact your veterinarian immediately.
"
" 
"
"The following symptoms may be associated with a dog experiencing a bowel obstruction:
"
"If your dog is vomiting but not producing any stool—this is a strong indication of an intestinal blockage. Contact your veterinarian immediately.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Provide a few details about what’s going on, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will quickly help you find out what to do next.
"
"A dog intestinal blockage is frequently caused by foreign bodies—items the dog eats that cause an obstruction. Common items include bones, balls, toys, rocks, clothing (such as underwear or socks), fruit pits, tampons, and linear objects (such as string, yarn, thread, ribbon).
"
"However, dog digestive blockages can also be caused by intestinal tumors or masses (abnormal new growths of tissue), especially in senior dogs.  
"
"Other possible causes of gastrointestinal blockages in dogs may include:
"
"Strictures (narrowing of intestines often due to scar tissue) 
"
"Adhesions (bands of scar tissue from previous surgery) 
"
"Intussusception (telescoping of the intestines where a portion of the intestine slides into an adjacent portion)  
"
"Severe intestinal parasite infestation 
"
"Hernias  
"
"Torsion (twisting of the intestines)  
"
"Severe inflammation of the small intestines 
"
"If you see or suspect that your dog has eaten a foreign object, seek immediate veterinary attention.  
"
"In some cases, the dog can immediately be made to vomit at a vet office, bringing up the foreign object before it can cause an intestinal blockage. This should be done no more than 30 minutes to 2 hours after the dog ate the object.  
"
"If your dog is showing symptoms of an intestinal blockage, it is likely too late to induce vomiting. In this case, your veterinarian will start with a good physical examination, palpating (touching) the abdomen to check for pain or evidence of masses, foreign bodies, or intussusception. Sometimes your vet will be able to feel the actual obstruction, but often they won’t. Most likely they will perform an abdominal X-ray for further evaluation. 
"
"If the X-ray is inconclusive or your vet is looking for more information before recommending surgery, they may perform an abdominal ultrasound. This is very useful for showing images of foreign bodies but will also provide more information if a tumor, intussusception, or another intestinal abnormality is suspected.  
"
"Blood work will likely also be recommended to rule out other causes of the symptoms and to check your dog’s hydration, electrolytes, and organ function.
"
"Depending on the size of the dog, location of the problem, how sick they are, and the size of the foreign body, sometimes dogs can pass an object and poop it out in their stool. However, if it gets stuck and becomes an intestinal blockage, surgery will be needed to identify and remove the blockage.  
"
"Before surgery, your veterinarian may want to admit your dog into hospital, where they can receive IV fluids (to rehydrate them) as well as medication for nausea and pain.  Medications such as Cerenia® and famotidine may be recommended.
"
"Once your dog has been stabilized, surgery is performed under anesthesia to identify the blockage. If a foreign object is the cause of the obstruction, sometimes an incision (cut) can simply be made into the intestines, the object removed, and the intestines sutured (closed) back up (this procedure is called an enterotomy).  
"
"Hives (also referred to as urticaria) are areas of the skin that appear reddened and raised. Just as with humans, hives can be very itchy for your dog. They’re a sign that an allergy is causing the immune system to overreact.
"
"Hives can appear very quickly—and disappear just as quickly. The raised red area of the skin is referred to as a “wheal,” and it can appear anywhere from a few minutes to hours after exposure to an allergen. Wheals can appear anywhere on your dog’s body, but they’re usually found on the head, neck, back, stomach, and legs.
"
"In mild cases, the hives will generally disappear within 12-48 hours after contact with the allergen. However, because of the risk that the reaction can worsen to dangerous swelling of your dog’s airways or a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, you should seek out treatment any time you see hives on your dog. This is especially true for hives that occur on the face or around the throat, which can lead to dangerous swelling and possible blockage of the airways.
"
"Red raised areas of skin called wheals, which can occur anywhere (including mucous membranes) but are most commonly seen on the head, neck, back, abdomen, and legs
"
"Intense itching
"
"Excessive drooling if the mouth is swollen
"
"Swelling (angioedema), which is particularly concerning when it involves the face and respiratory system and can have severe and life-threatening consequences
"
"The allergen that causes the hives may be environmental, chemical, or dietary. Any allergen your dog is sensitive can also lead to hives. Common causes include:
"
"Insect stings/bites (often involving the head and neck of your pup)
"
"Shampoos or topical agents
"
"Medications
"
"However, if the intestines are damaged or there is dead tissue, sections of the intestines may need to be removed along with the cause of the obstruction, such as foreign body or tumor (this is called a resection and anastomosis).
"
"Early diagnosis and treatment of intestinal blockage in a dog is important for a good outcome and to prevent complications (such as damage to the intestines, intestine rupture, leakage, splitting, or peritonitis). If surgery is needed. it should be performed as soon as possible.  
"
"After surgery, most dogs will need to remain hospitalized for 1-2 days on IV fluids and pain medications. They can usually go home after they start eating again, and if they are not vomiting. The recovery time is typical for any abdominal surgery and includes 10-14 days of rest and restricted activity. 
"
"Your vet will likely recommend a recovery cone or surgical suit to prevent an incisional infection. Some dogs may also need to be placed a bland diet or prescription diet like Hill’s® i/d to help with recovery.
"
"Most dogs make a complete recovery and go back to their normal lives, but this can vary based on the cause of the intestinal blockage.
"
"If a foreign body was the cause of your dog’s blockage, it’s important to make sure they don’t eat any foreign objects in the future, as complications are more likely when there is scar tissue from previous surgeries. If a tumor caused the blockage, the vet will send a sample to the lab to identify the type of tumor and the likely outcome.  
"
"If it is a complete intestinal blockage then a dog can only poop what is behind the obstruction and then nothing more will come out. With a partial obstruction, which can be just as serious as a complete, stool can still pass often as diarrhea, flat stool, or soft stool. If you think your dog may have an intestinal blockage, contact your vet immediately.
"
"Untreated, a dog with a complete obstruction would likely die within 3-4 days. If a dog is diagnosed with an intestinal blockage, surgery is recommended as soon as possible.
"
"If you suspect your dog has an intestinal blockage, take them to be examined by a veterinarian immediately. The vet will help you determine whether or not your dog needs surgery and how to proceed.
"
"The cost can vary widely depending on many factors, including where you live and how sick the dog is. According to CareCredit, dog owners can expect to pay anywhere between $800 and $7,000.

"Food allergens
"
"Insects bites, chemical contact, and medications are the most common.
"
"Your vet will closely examine your dog to locate the distinctive wheals associated with hives. Wheals typically have hair on them, and may appear in clusters. Beyond the physical examination, other parts of the diagnosis include:
"
"Any history you are able to provide; be as thorough as you can in describing allergens your dog might have come into contact with and when and where you first saw the hives
"
"Your dog’s response to treatment
"
"Dogs with hives usually respond quickly to treatment, which may include:
"
"Antihistamine (oral or injectable) and a steroid
"
"Injectable medications and intravenous fluids (in very serious cases)
"
"At-home treatments may include:
"
"Cold compresses over the hives or swollen areas to give relief from itching
"
"Antihistamines, but only under the supervision of your vet
"
"Work with your vet to determine the cause of the hives, using both your dog’s health history and history of exposure to allergens. Depending on the cause and the frequency, your vet may recommend:
"
"Allergy testing to confirm environmental allergens
"
"Immunotherapy treatment to desensitize your dog to specific allergens
"
"A food trial to find ingredients that cause a reaction and develop specific dietary recommendations
"
"Yes. Hives indicate an allergic reaction within the body. Although the hives themselves are mostly just uncomfortable, they could lead to very dangerous complications, including anaphylaxis and death. It’s best to treat even mild cases of hives.
"
"It is important to speak to your veterinarian before giving your dog any medication. The vet may recommend certain medications to give your dog now or to have ready for future episodes.
"
"Hives can disappear within a few hours or last up to 48 hours.
"
"There’s a small chance that psychological stress can cause dog hives, but generally, anxiety merely worsens hives that are already present.
"
"Yes, hives indicate a larger issue—an allergic reaction—and require treatment to make your dog comfortable and keep the reaction from progressing.
"
"Hives are red, often swollen areas of skin that may be very itchy. They can be anywhere on the body, but you’ll often spot them on your dog’s head, neck, back, stomach, or legs.

"Simply put, hypothermia describes the situation where a dog’s body temperature is significantly lower than normal. The drop in body temperature must be dramatic enough to put the dog’s well-being at risk, however. Being cold isn’t the same as being hypothermic.
"
"If you notice that one or both of your dog’s eyes are red, you may be wondering what the cause could be.
"
"Dogs with allergies more commonly show symptoms related to the skin or intestinal tract, but it is possible that allergies may be causing the irritation in your dog’s eyes—just like in people with seasonal allergies.
"
"The medical term “allergic conjunctivitis” is used to describe inflammation of the eye that’s usually caused by environmental allergens like pollen and mold. Dogs with skin-based allergy symptoms (allergic dermatitis) are more likely to experience allergic conjunctivitis than dogs with no history of allergies.
"
"If you believe that your dog is suffering from allergic conjunctivitis, it’s important to have them seen by a veterinarian to rule out other more serious diseases that can have similar symptoms.
"
"Here’s what you need to know about dog eye allergies.
"
"In dogs, redness of the eyes is a vague symptom that can be caused by a wide variety of underlying diseases.
"
"For allergic conjunctivitis, the redness is usually seen in both eyes. You may also notice symptoms like:
"
"Squinting of the affected eye(s)
"
"Pawing at the face
"
"Discharge coming from one or both eyes
"
"The average body temperature for dogs is warmer than what is normal for people—around 101.5 ˚F, give or take a degree (100.5-102.5°F or 38-39.2°C).
"
"When a dog’s body temperature drops to around 98˚F or 99˚F (37°C), hypothermia is setting in.
"
"Initially, a dog’s body responds to hypothermia by narrowing blood vessels near the surface to send blood away from the skin, legs, ears, feet, etc., and towards essential organs like the brain and the heart. Here are the symptoms of hypothermia in dogs, from mild to severe.
"
"Signs of mild to moderate hypothermia in dogs include:
"
"Shivering
"
"Muscle stiffness
"
"Lethargy
"
"Difficulty walking
"
"Pale gums
"
"Cool body surfaces
"
"Confusion
"
"As hypothermia worsens, dogs will:
"
"Stop shivering
"
"Collapse
"
"Have fixed and dilated pupils
"
"Develop slow and irregular heart and breathing rates
"
"Become comatose
"
"Potentially die
"
"At this point, you may notice that a hypothermic dog’s extremities (ears, legs, feet, paws) appear somewhat pale and feel cool to the touch. While this physiological response can certainly help a dog survive, it does increase the risk that they’ll suffer from frostbite as time goes on.
"
"Look for:
"
"Cold areas of the body, especially the extremities (ears, legs, feet, paws)
"
"To generate extra heat, a dog with mild to moderate hypothermia will shiver, and their muscles will become tense. This muscular activity produces warmth, but it can also make a dog’s movements stiff and clumsy.
"
"At this point, a hypothermic dog may become sluggish and seem confused.
"
"Look for:
"
"Shivering
"
"Stiff or clumsy movements; difficulty walking
"
"If your dog has a history of itchy skin, it's worth mentioning to your veterinarian.
"
"Dogs with itchy skin will more commonly experience allergic conjunctivitis than the general dog population.
"
"Affected dogs are usually under 3 years of age when they first become symptomatic. Although all dog breeds have the potential to develop allergic dermatitis, common breeds with a predisposition for this condition include:
"
"Boxer
"
"Cocker Spaniel
"
"French Bulldog
"
"German Shepherd
"
"Golden Retriever
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"Poodle
"
"West Highland White Terrier
"
"Although a test called “conjunctival cytology” may reveal inflammatory cells that will confirm a diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis, the cells are not always present. As a result, many veterinarians will diagnose eye allergies through the process of elimination.
"
"Your veterinarian may perform several brief tests to rule out diseases with similar symptoms, like eye infections, dry eye, or corneal ulcers. Other details, like your dog’s age, breed, and history of itchy skin, can also help point your veterinarian to this diagnosis.
"
"In rare cases, a biopsy of the conjunctival tissue around the eyes—taken while your dog is under general anesthesia—may be needed to achieve a definitive diagnosis, or to rule out other, more serious causes of red eyes.
"
"An emerging test called the conjunctival provocation test has shown promise as a quick and easy test to definitively diagnose allergic conjunctivitis. However, it’s currently not widely available and would likely be performed by veterinary dermatologists—not your general practice veterinarian.
"
"In mild cases, simply flushing the eyes with sterile saline once or twice a day may be enough to remove the allergen and resolve the symptoms.
"
"You should not use contact solution for this purpose.
"
"Although antihistamines provide relief for people with eye-related allergies, antihistamines have a variable effect in dogs with this condition. Therefore, eyedrops containing steroids are often the treatment of choice for dogs with allergic conjunctivitis.
"
"It’s important to note that steroid-based eyedrops can be very harmful to dogs with other, similar diseases in the eyes, so you should never start treatment without first consulting your veterinarian.
"
"Severe cases may require the use of oral medications in addition to eyedrops.
"
"Generally, a recheck is recommended after one to two weeks of treatment so that your veterinarian can assess how well the medications have worked.
"
"If minimal improvement is seen, it’s possible to be seen by a veterinary dermatologist, who can perform allergy testing and other diagnostics to uncover which allergens may be triggering your dog’s allergic conjunctivitis.
"
"If possible, the allergens are removed, often by changing the diet. If removing allergens is not possible, your dog’s dermatologist may suggest immunotherapy for long-term treatment.
"
"If the allergen can’t be removed or treated with immunotherapy, it is very likely that a dog with allergic conjunctivitis will experience flare-ups throughout her life. Fortunately, the symptoms caused by allergic conjunctivitis are fairly mild, and with proper treatment and management, affected dogs generally live long and happy lives.

"As severe hypothermia sets in, a dog will stop shivering because their muscle cells have run out of energy.
"
"Once shivering stops, the dog’s body temperature may begin to rapidly drop.
"
"The chemical reactions that are necessary for normal body functioning in a dog will slow down or stop altogether. The dog’s heart rate slows and becomes erratic, and their breathing slows. As oxygen levels drop in the bloodstream, the dog will become increasingly lethargic and unresponsive.
"
"Eventually shock, organ failure, coma, and death will follow.
"
"Look for:
"
"Shivering that has stopped
"
"Rapid drop in body temperature
"
"Slower breathing
"
"Collapsing
"
"Lethargic and/or unresponsive
"
"Fixed and dilated pupils
"
"Exposure to cold temperatures is the most obvious cause of hypothermia in dogs, particularly if it’s also windy or the dog becomes damp, but there are other causes of dog hypothermia as well.
"
"Certain dogs are at higher risk for exposure-related hypothermia than others. These include elderly dogs, puppies, small dogs, and dogs who have short or thin coats or are unused to cold temperatures. All these factors, especially in combination, make it harder for dogs to keep themselves warm when temperatures drop.
"
"Veterinarians often have to take measures to prevent or treat hypothermia in dogs who are in the hospital for anesthesia and surgery.1
"
"Drugs and procedures used to anesthetize dogs can lead to increased heat loss through the skin and respiratory tract and reduce the body’s ability to respond appropriately.
"
"Surgery can result in more heat loss because:
"
"The dog’s coat is shaved
"
"The dog’s skin is cleaned with cool antiseptic solutions

"Canine influenza virus (CIV), commonly referred to as “dog flu,” is a highly contagious respiratory virus that affects dogs of all ages and breeds. Although dog flu has been discovered in most of the United States, fortunately it doesn’t commonly cause death in dogs and, for many, won’t even necessitate a trip to the veterinarian.
"
"Dog flu is caused by two different types of influenza viruses: H3N2 and H3N8. Both were originally a flu virus affecting other canine species, birds, and equines that now also affects dogs. H3N2 can affect cats as well, but neither virus has been reported to affect humans.
"
"Because dog flu is a respiratory virus, your dog will experience symptoms associated with respiratory disease and common flu-like symptoms, such as:
"
"In severe cases of dog flu, your dog may experience secondary bacterial infections, fever (higher than 103.5 F), and even pneumonia, which can be life-threatening.
"
"Dog flu is extremely contagious to other dogs. Studies have shown that the virus can travel up to 20 feet in dogs’ respiratory droplets when they sneeze or cough. This is the primary route of infection, but dogs can also become infected with dog flu through contaminated food and water bowls, shared toys, leashes, as well as through clothing and indirectly through human contact (i.e., handling an infected dog and then touching/playing with other dogs).
"
"The canine influenza virus can also survive in the environment for an extensive amount of time. CIV can survive on skin and hands for 12 hours, on clothing for 24 hours, and on surfaces for up to 48 hours.
"
"It takes two to four days after exposure to the virus before clinical signs develop. This is called the incubation period. Most dogs recover within two to three weeks but dogs with H3N2 should be isolated for 21 days and dogs infected with H3N8 should be isolated for at least seven days as they may still be infectious.    
"
"Even though any dog can become infected with dog flu, dogs adopted from shelters or those that visit crowded doggy areas such as dog parks, doggy daycares, or kennels may be at increased risk.
"
"The dog is laid on cold surgery tables
"
"Cool intravenous fluids are administered
"
"Internal organs are exposed to the air
"
"Sick and injured dogs are also at increased risk for become hypothermic.
"
"Health problems like kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, some types of poisonings, and bleeding due to trauma can all lead to heat loss and/or the inability to regulate body temperature.
"
"The diagnosis of hypothermia is based on a dog’s body temperature.
"
"Using a rectal thermometer provides the most accurate measurements. Any dog with a rectal temperature of under 98-99˚F (37°C) is hypothermic and requires treatment. If a thermometer is unavailable, a vet can look at the dog’s symptoms to make a reasonable guess as to whether hypothermia is a likely diagnosis.
"
"Dogs with hypothermia need to be rewarmed, but the process should occur gradually. Think “warm,” not “hot.”
"
"Do not use a heating pad, as it gives off excessive heat that can lead to burns, or it can direct too much blood flow towards the skin, which can worsen shock.
"
"Here’s what to do if your dog has hypothermia:
"
"Get your dog into a warm building or vehicle.
"
"Wrap them in blankets, towels, coats, etc. If you can, warm up some blankets on a radiator, in a clothes dryer, or using a hairdryer.
"
"Place bottles of warm water next to your dog, but always keep a couple layers of fabric between the bottle and your dog’s skin.
"
"Get to the nearest veterinary office immediately.
"
"Once your dog is at the clinic, the veterinarian can employ more aggressive warming techniques.
"
"Hypothermic dogs can be given warmed intravenous fluids. Warmed fluids may be infused into a dog’s abdomen, stomach, and colon, and they may be given warmed and humidified oxygen to breathe.2
"
"The veterinary team will closely monitor your dog’s body temperature, heart rate and rhythm, oxygenation, blood-glucose levels, and many other parameters so problems can be managed as they arise.
"
"Additional treatments directed towards any underlying health problems will be necessary for dogs who develop hypothermia as a result illness or injury.
"
"Dogs with mild to moderate hypothermia should survive as long as they quickly receive appropriate treatment.
"
"Severe hypothermia carries a worse prognosis, but some dogs can be revived even if they are comatose, in part because low temperatures reduce the oxygen and energy needs of cells in the body.
"
"There is no way to know how a dog will respond to rewarming without trying, so always get a hypothermic dog to a veterinary hospital as quickly as possible.3
"
"Signs of mild to moderate hypothermia in dogs include:
"
"Shivering
"
"Muscle stiffness
"
"Lethargy
"
"Difficulty walking
"
"Pale gums
"
"Canine influenza belongs to the group of influenza A viruses, which are broken down into types based on their proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Usually, they are specific to a single species, but over time—through mutations and other changes—they can affect other animals.
"
"H3N8 and H3N2, the types of influenza viruses seen in dogs, are prime examples. The H3N8 virus was originally found in horses and discovered in the United States dog population in 2004. The H3N2 virus was first discovered in the United States in 2015 and seemed to have originated from the Asian bird population. 
"
"Fortunately, it has yet to be shown that humans can become infected with the dog flu or vice versa. 
"
"Symptoms of dog flu will resemble many other types of respiratory infections, so it is important that your dog be tested so treatment can be directed appropriately.
"
"For CIV, a PCR panel is often performed, where a swab is obtained from your dog’s nose, conjunctiva, or pharynx, then submitted to a laboratory and analyzed for viral DNA. Additional testing such as bloodwork and chest radiographs are often recommended to evaluate your dog’s general health and hydration status, and to look for evidence of pneumonia, which can be life-threatening and should be treated aggressively. 
"
"Call your veterinarian prior to arrival to let them know that your dog is experiencing flu-like symptoms, as there are protocols and procedures that need to be followed to mitigate transmission to other dogs.
"
"Treatment of CIV in dogs is largely supportive. Keeping your dog calm, rested, and hydrated is paramount to ensuring a speedy recovery. In the hospital, this may include IV fluids, cough suppressants, and nutritional support. For cases involving secondary bacterial infection, an antibiotic such as Clavamox® or doxycycline, among others, is often prescribed. 
"
"Infected dogs should be isolated from other dogs (and cats) at the onset of symptoms and up to 3-4 weeks. This means no dog parks, boarding, grooming, doggy daycare, and so on.
"
"And because the virus can be transmitted from clothing, pet parents should change clothes/shoes and disinfect with hand-washing before interacting with other pets.
"
"Fortunately, many dogs recover from dog flu uneventfully within a few weeks and have little to no lasting complications. Your dog may have a cough that lasts during this period as well. Younger or older dogs, or dogs that are immunocompromised, may experience more severe symptoms such as pneumonia and may even die from the disease. To ensure the best outcome possible, it is important to seek veterinary attention at the first sign that your dog is sick. 
"
"Fortunately, there is a vaccine for dogs designed to protect against both strains of CIV. Nobivac® and Zoetis® both manufacture the vaccine, which can be given to puppies as young as 7 or 8 weeks of age, with a booster three weeks later and annually after.
"
"Side effects are rare and include symptoms associated with hypersensitivity and allergic reactions, such as vomiting, diarrhea, facial swelling, hives, and—less likely—severe anaphylactic reaction. Dogs who frequent boarding or grooming facilities, doggie daycares, dog parks, dog shows, or other competitions are at a higher risk. 
"
"Ask your veterinarian if vaccinations for respiratory illnesses should be part of your dog’s preventative care plan. Keep in mind that vaccines may not always prevent infection but will make it less likely—and, if infected, symptoms are often milder and the course of disease shorter. 
"
"Fortunately, the influenza virus is easily killed in the environment, often with routine household cleaners like bleach and soapy water. Wash your hands and clothing before interacting with any dogs as well as in between dogs.

"Ectropion is when a dog’s eyelid appears like it is sagging away from their eye rather than resting against it. It usually affects the lower eyelid and it causes a “droopy eye” look.
"
"When the lower eyelid stretches and doesn’t rest against the dog’s cornea, it causes chronic irritation and secondary conjunctivitis, or pink eye.
"
"With ectropion, a dog’s eyelids, blink reflex, and tears become unable to perform their normal functions of cleaning, shielding, and lubricating the eye. The loose eyelid exposes the eye to air, dust, bacteria, and stagnant tears. This causes the conjunctival sac to be chronically inflamed, which leads to conjunctivitis.
"
"A healthy dog ear is clean and dry.
"
"It’s normal for small amounts of microscopic bacteria and yeast to live in a dog's outer ear canal, but when a buildup of debris occurs—or the normal, healthy ear canal is compromised—bacteria and yeast can overgrow and cause an infection.
"
"Ear infections are one of the most common type of infections in dogs and typically affect the outer ear (otitis externa). Basset Hounds, Shar-Pei, Labradoodles, Beagles, and Cockapoos are the five breeds with the highest rate of ear infections—but any dog can have an ear infection. 
"
"Common clinical signs include head shaking, scratching at the ears, ear odor, and visible debris in the ear.
"
"The anatomy of a dog's ear starts outside the head and moves in as follows: Ear flap (pinnae), ear canal, ear drum, middle ear, inner ear. 
"
"Otitis is divided into three types based on the location of a dog’s ear infection:
"
"Otitis externa—inflammation of the ear canal
"
"Otitis media—inflammation of the middle ear
"
" 
"
"Symptoms of ectropion in dogs include:
"
"Chronic keratitis (inflammation of the cornea)
"
"Eye discharge (mucus, pus, or brown or black staining under the eye)
"
"Excessive watering of the eye (epiphora)
"
"Scleral redness (conjunctivitis)
"
"Dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis)
"
"Ectropion in dogs is primarily a developmental condition that is breed related and presumed to be hereditary. However, secondary ectropion can develop after facial trauma, resulting in facial nerve paralysis. Common causes of acquired secondary ectropion are large eyelid wounds left to heal on their own or other eyelid injuries that cause a dog’s eyelids to droop.
"
"Ectropion only worsens over time because the eyelids lose muscle and become less taut with age. For this reason, have your veterinarian evaluate your dog for treatment options as soon as you observe signs of ectropion.
"
"The dog breeds most commonly prone to ectropion are:
"
"Basset Hound
"
"Bloodhound
"
"Bernese Mountain Dog
"
"Coonhound
"
"Bouvier des Flandres
"
"Boxer
"
"Bull Terrier
"
"Cane Corso
"
"Chow Chow
"
"Dogue de Bordeaux
"
"English Bulldog
"
"English Setter
"
"English Cocker Spaniel
"
"Saint Bernard
"
"Great Dane
"
"Newfoundland
"
"Otitis interna—inflammation of the inner ear
"
"Otitis externa is the most common infection, as this part of the ear is most exposed to the outside world. Ear infections can be acute (quick onset) or chronic (recurrent). Dogs may have an infection in one or both ears.
"
"If your pup has chronic ear infections, treatment will require working closely with your veterinarian. It's important that your vet does testing on your dog to choose the appropriate medication. Chronic infections can require medication consistently for six to eight weeks.
"
"After treatment, testing is needed again to ensure that the ear infection has cleared. If your vet stops medicating your dog too soon or doesn’t treat underlying problems, the infection can return. It may even become resistant to certain medications. 
"
"Common signs of dog ear infections include:
"
"Redness
"
"Odor (a yeasty, corn chip-like smell)
"
"Itching/scratching at ears
"
"Pain
"
"Shaking of the head
"
"Head tilt
"
"Discharge
"
"Scabs or crusting around the ear pinnae
"
"Dogs may also experience hearing loss or balance issues.
"
"Rarely, a dog ear infection may affect a pup’s appetite if your pup is having system-wide effects. This is seen more often with otitis media or interna.
"
"Several factors can cause dog ear infections.
"
"Often, an underlying problem leads to the inability of the normal protective barrier of a dog’s ear to work properly. Once the ear becomes moist or inflamed, it's easy for bacteria or yeast to overgrow and cause infection in a pup.
"
"A few common causes of infection include:
"
"Foreign bodies (grass awn, foxtails) that get into the ear
"
"Ear mites
"
"Excessive moisture from bathing or swimming
"
"Food allergies
"
"Environmental allergies
"
"Endocrine issues such as hypothyroidism
"
"Autoimmune diseases such as pemphigus, lupus, or vasculitis
"
"Mastiff
"
"Great Pyrenees
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"Leonberger
"
"Unfortunately, ectropion is actually a sought-after trait in many commonly affected breeds. It creates a diamond-shaped eye, which gives the dog a devoted and sad expression. This leads some people to breed specifically for ectropion.
"
"Ectropion is diagnosed during a veterinary ophthalmologic examination of your pet’s eyes and eyelids. Your pet does not need to be sedated. In fact, pets should be awake for the veterinarian to appropriately determine their natural eyelid conformation, or shape.
"
"Surgery is the only effective way to treat ectropion in dogs. This involves primarily shortening and tightening the eyelid. Surgery provides a normal lower eyelid length that’s positioned properly in relation to the cornea.
"
"Recovery from ectropion surgery is rapid. Eyelid swelling will peak approximately 24 hours following surgery and can take two to four weeks to completely resolve. Dogs will be required to wear an Elizabethan collar following surgery to protect the sutures around their eyes.
"
"Topical eye medications may be prescribed after surgery depending on possible underlying corneal or lacrimal disease(s). Oral antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and analgesics are often recommended after surgery as well.
"
"Sutures from ectropion surgery are removed 14 days after surgery, and the Elizabethan collar can be removed a few days after that.
"
"While surgical complications from ectropion surgery are rare, they can include:
"
"Under-correction of the eyelid will not resolve the underlying problem and will then require additional surgeries.
"
"Overcorrection of the eyelid can actually result in the formation of entropion (when the eyelid grows inward). It causes trauma to the cornea.
"
"Self-trauma to the incision site usually occurs if the Elizabethan collar is removed too soon after surgery.
"
"Ectropion is caused primarily by a genetic defect in the animal’s hereditary lineage. Acquired cases of ectropion can occur when a dog has a facial injury and sustains neurological damage.

"Polyps (fleshy growths inside the ear canal)
"
"Certain types of cancer
"
"Trauma to the ear
"
"These issues can make the ear canal vulnerable to a bacterial infection and/or a yeast infection.
"
"When a dog is in pain and scratching and shaking excessively, an aural hematoma can develop. This is seen in the pinna or earflap, where ruptured blood vessels leak blood that clots. This causes swelling and pain.
"
"Your vet will need to test the ear debris or perform scans of your dog’s ear to choose the right treatment for your pup.
"
"These tests may include:
"
"Once the details of your dog’s ear infection are known, treatment will likely consist of multiple elements that may include topical, oral, or surgical therapies.
"
"Depending on the type and severity of ear infection, an ear cleaner may be recommended that could be medicated or non-medicated.
"
"Typically, cleaning a dog's ears with an ear cleaner will be recommended every day or every other day while treating an ear infection. It's important to follow your veterinarian’s instructions for ear cleaner.
"
"Ear cleaner should be done before applying medications—you don’t want to clean out the medications. 
"
"Ear medications will likely come in the form of ear drops that will come with an applicator for ease of getting the medication into your pup's ear canal.  Depending on the type of ear infection, ear medications may be an antibiotic, anti-fungal, or both.
"
"Some medications also include topical steroids to help with the itch. Ear medications are typically recommended once or twice a day for seven to 10 days, so it’s important to follow your veterinarian’s specific instructions. 
"
"Depending on the severity of your dog's ear infection, an oral antibiotic, antifungal, or a steroid medication may be used.
"
"Ears that have had severe chronic disease may no longer respond to medical treatments. 
"
"The goal of surgery for these ears is to open a pup's ear canal or sometimes to completely remove all diseased tissue. This procedure is called a total ear canal ablation (TECA) and ventral bulla osteotomy (VBO).
"
"Most dogs recover uneventfully from ear infections.
"
"However, if your dog is having frequent or chronic ear infections, your vet will likely recommend additional testing to determine if there is an underlying cause.
"
"Long-term management may include weekly preventative cleaning of the ears and/or diet change. 
"
"Regular grooming, ear cleaning, and ear maintenance are important parts of pet care. Routine ear cleansing is especially important if your dog swims often.
"
"Cleaning is best accomplished with a vet-approved ear cleaning product made specifically for pups. These typically have been specifically formulated for effective pH ranges for dogs and contain drying agents.
"
"Dog ear infections require vet treatment and medication to restore a healthy ear canal.
"
"After your vet has evaluated your pup, they will determine if any further home treatment is appropriate. This can be done if a small number of debris is present, and the eardrum is intact.
"
"Most often, a dog ear infection will not go away on its own. All types of otitis require a veterinarian to evaluate the infection and the eardrum.
"
"If the eardrum is ruptured, certain cleaners and medications can be damaging to a dog's middle ear.
"
"Untreated ear infections can result in damage to a dog’s hearing and ear. Ear infections can progress to systemic illness and cause additional symptoms such as not eating or lethargy.
"
"Ear infections are painful for your pup. If you think your fur baby may have an ear infection, make an appointment to see the vet right away.
"
"It's extremely rare but possible for an ear infection to spread into the brain. Most ear infections in dogs are of the external ear—meaning in the area from the ear flap (pinnae) to the ear drum.
"
"However, dogs can also get middle and inner ear infections, though less commonly. If a dog has a severe inner ear infection, it's possible that the infection could invade or extend into their brain. 
"
"It depends on the cause, but most dog ear infections are not contagious.
"
"However, if the cause is ear mites, these parasites are extremely contagious. With ear mites, all pets in the home must be treated simultaneously.
"
"Ear mites are relatively common in puppies and kittens and may not be noticed initially when adopting a new pet. However, shortly after bringing your new pet home, multiple pets in the house will be scratching and shaking. 
"
"Rarely, a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or possible other contagious infection can be cultured from an infected ear.
"
"Practice good hand washing when interacting with and treating a pet with an ear infection. Limit other pets licking the infected pet’s ears.

"Canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CCD or CDS) is a condition related to the aging of a dog's brain, which ultimately leads to changes in awareness, deficits in learning and memory, and decreased responsiveness to stimuli. This syndrome in dogs has been compared to dementia or Alzheimer's in humans.
"
"Although the initial symptoms of the disorder are mild, they gradually worsen over time, beyond what can be expected with normal aging. These pets experience “cognitive decline” which is the slow decrease in the brains ability to perform normal tasks. In fact, clinical signs of cognitive dysfunction syndrome are found in nearly one in three dogs over the age of 11, and by the age of 16, nearly all dogs display at least one sign.
"
"Here’s everything you need to know about dog dementia, from the symptoms, causes and life expectancy to treatment and prevention.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"These are the most common symptoms of dementia in dogs:
"
"Disorientation/confusion
"
"Getting stuck going around objects
"
"Not recognizing familiar people or pets
"
"Staring blankly at walls
"
"Pacing
"
"Changes in behavior
"
"Extreme irritability
"
"Decreased desire to play
"
"Excessive licking
"
"Lack of self-grooming
"
"Loss of appetite (anorexia)
"
"Anxiety/restlessness/Impaired memory
"
"Seeming disregard for previously learned training or house rules
"
"Slow to learn new tasks
"
"Inability to follow familiar routes
"
"Fecal and urinary soiling in the home
"
"Changes in sleep cycle
"
"Night waking
"
"Night vocalization
"
"Night pacing
"
"The exact causes of CCD are not known, but many of the same changes that cause problems as people age are likely to also cause problems as our pets age. Scientists are studying CCD and its similarities to Alzheimer's. Research is ongoing and new developments are constantly coming to light as we study the aging of our canine companions, but here is some of what we do know.
"
"As dogs age, the brain atrophies, meaning that the cells die. This especially affects the portion of the brain responsible for learning and memory (the cerebral cortex) and the areas responsible for coordination (the cerebellum). 
"
"Research has also found that dogs with CCD have an abnormal protein (beta amyloid) building up in their brains. This protein buildup has been shown to cause decreased nerve signaling in the brain. In dogs with CCD neurotransmitters, which help the brain to send signals, are also degraded by high levels of a compound called monoamine oxidase B (MAOB).
"
"Dogs with epilepsy and dogs that lead a sedentary lifestyle have also been shown to be at a higher risk for developing CCD.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated the unusual behaviors or complications.
"
"They will then perform a complete physical examination to evaluate your dog’s overall health status and cognitive functions. Routine blood tests, thyroid testing, ultrasounds and X-rays are also employed to rule out other diseases that may lead to behavioral changes associated with canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome. Your veterinarian may also recommend advanced imaging like an MRI or CT scan.
"
"Dogs with canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome require lifelong therapy and support. While there is no cure, there are several things that you can do at home to help your dog's cognitive functions.
"
"Maintaining a healthy and stimulating environment will help slow the progression of cognitive decline. This typically involves imposing a daily routine of exercise, play and mental stimulation. Maintaining a strict routine, especially at bedtime can help to minimize CCD symptoms.
"
"Making your home more accessible and safer for your senior dog can also help:
"
"Night lights can help your senior dog navigate in the dark.
"
"Potty pads near doors give your pup a place to go if they can’t make it until you come home or wake up.
"
"Orthopedic foam beds (with washable covers) can make sleep more comfortable.
"
"In addition, medication and behavioral therapy can be used to help keep your dog comfortable and active. Your veterinarian may also suggest employing a special, balanced diet to improve your dog's cognitive function in terms of memory, learning ability, etc.
"
"Prescription diets for brain health are also available in the form of Hills’ b/d, Royal Canin’s Mature Consult and Purina Pro Plan’s Neurocare. These diets are typically rich with antioxidants, vitamin B, E and C, selenium, flavonoids, beta carotene, carotenoids, and carnitine—all considered excellent for improving a dog's cognitive functions. 
"
"Additional supplementation of omega fatty acids can also be extremely beneficial to dogs with CCD. Other supplements that may benefit your dog include melatonin, additional vitamin B, and s-adenosylmethionine (sam-e).
"
"Some dogs benefit from anti-anxiety medications if anxiety related symptoms are a major factor of your dog’s CCD. Anipryl (selegeline) is a prescription medication geared just towards dogs with CCD. This medication inhibits MAOB, which allows neurotransmitters to remain in the brain where they are needed
"
"Treatment for CCD is highly dependent on symptoms and a thorough discussion of all treatment options with your dog’s veterinarian is needed before treatment begins.
"
"Your veterinarian will evaluate your dog periodically to monitor their response to therapy and the progression of symptoms. However, if you notice any behavioral changes in your dog, notify your vet immediately.
"
"In geriatric dogs, any change can be serious, so it’s important to talk to your veterinarian at the first sign. For stable patients, twice-yearly checkups may be sufficient, unless new problems arise.
"
"Since canine cognitive dysfunction is a degenerative process that occurs in a dog’s senior years, similar to Alzheimer’s in humans, life expectancy can be a tricky prognosis to make. If a dog is otherwise healthy, then the dementia will eventually diminish your dog’s quality of life, but there has not been a specific timeframe established.
"
"The best way to monitor your dog’s health and cognitive functioning is to work with your veterinarian and track your dog’s quality of life. This will help you determine when your dog is letting you know it’s time.

"For many dogs, going on an outing in the family car is an enjoyable adventure. However, for dogs that experience motion sickness, car rides are anything but enjoyable, no matter how fun the destination may be.
"
"Motion sickness in dogs can result from conflicting sensory signals that are sent to the emetic (vomiting) center in the brain.
"
"In other words, the signals from the vestibular system in the inner ear (which is involved in balance) conflict with signals from the eyes, possibly leading to nausea and vomiting, similar to motion sickness in people.
"
"Many receptors are involved in this process, including:
"
"Chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ)
"
"Histamine
"
"Neurokinin 1 substance P (NK1) receptors
"
"Fear, anxiety, or a previous traumatic experience in a vehicle may also trigger motion sickness in dogs. Dog motion sickness can occur during travel in any type of vehicle.
"
"Puppies seem to be more susceptible than adult dogs because the parts of the inner ear that are involved in balance are not yet fully developed in puppies. The good news is that motion sickness in puppies often improves and resolves with age.
"
"There are many potential signs of dog car sickness to watch for, including:
"
"Excessive lip licking
"
"Whining
"
"Drooling
"
"Yawning
"
"Vomiting
"
"Excessive panting
"
"Trembling/shaking
"
"There have been many natural remedies suggested for dogs that experience motion sickness.
"
"There is anecdotal evidence that ginger helps treat nausea and vomiting in dogs. Consult your veterinarian before trying it, though, as it should not be given to dogs with known bleeding disorders or in dogs that are taking anticoagulants or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
"
"Adaptil is a calming pheromone product for dogs that comes in a spray or collar. The collar can be used daily for calming effects, while the spray is intended to be used 15-20 minutes prior to travel or any other stressful event.
"
"Spray the inside of your vehicle or the travel kennel that your dog will be riding in prior to loading your dog.
"
"There are several supplements that are designed to calm dogs when given orally, including:
"
"Solliquin
"
"Composure
"
"Rescue Remedy
"
"Some may need to be given daily for several days to weeks for maximum benefit. There are few negative side effects associated with these products, so they are safe options for most dogs.
"
"Lavender is also a safe aromatherapy option that you can use in a spray form. You can also saturate a cotton ball with lavender essential oil and place it in your vehicle a few minutes before leaving the house.
"
"Just be sure to either throw the cotton ball away after your trip and to put it in an area where your dog cannot get to it and ingest it before or during the trip.
"
"One other product you might consider trying for dog motion sickness is CBD (cannabidiol). CBD has become more widely available and comes in many forms, including chews, treats, and oil.
"
"Regulations concerning CBD vary widely, and the quality of the CBD in products is not always guaranteed. If you are interested in trying CBD for motion sickness in your dog, contact your veterinarian to discuss reliable options.
"
"There are a few pharmaceutical options for preventing motion sickness in dogs.
"
"Cerenia (maropitant) is the only FDA-approved prescription medication for vomiting due to motion sickness in dogs. It blocks the NK1 receptors in the brainstem vomiting center, which is the location most responsible for the nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness.
"
"Dogs should be at least 8 weeks old to receive Cerenia, and it is given once daily. It is highly effective—in a study of dogs, only 7% vomited during a one-hour car ride after being treated with Cerenia.
"
"Meclizine is an antihistamine with sedative and anti-vomiting effects that’s available over the counter and by prescription. The most common side effect is drowsiness. It is given once daily.
"
"Two over-the-counter options that may be used for motion sickness in dogs are Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Dramamine (dimenhydrinate).
"
"Both products are antihistamines that can be given every 8 hours and may have sedative effects.
"
"Dramamine may be better tolerated given with a small amount of food. Benadryl can have potential gastrointestinal effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased appetite.
"
"If using Benadryl, be careful not to get combination products that may be used for colds in people—the product should only include Benadryl (diphenhydramine) as the active ingredient.
"
"If your dog suffers from anxiety in the car that results in motion sickness, an anti-anxiety medication may be needed, along with behavioral modification.
"
"For any medications you would like to use for motion sickness in your dog, your veterinarian can provide guidance on safety and what will work best in your four-legged family member.
"
"Here are a few different things you can do to help minimize your dog’s car sickness while traveling.
"
"Whether your dog suffers from car sickness or not, it is always a good idea to use a dog car seat, a dog harness with the seat belt, or a travel crate. Such products will help minimize sudden movements or a change in position that may trigger nausea.
"
"It is also helpful if your dog can see out the window to help their eyes and vestibular system coordinate what is happening during travel.
"
"If possible, cracking the windows just a little may help equalize pressure and minimize negative effects on your dog’s vestibular system.
"
"Don’t feed your dog a large meal right before travel, and try to take breaks on long trips, which is helpful for human and canine passengers.
"
"Whether you bring your dog home as a puppy or adopt an older friend, take the time to acclimate them to car rides.
"
"For fearful dogs, this may mean a long process of desensitization and counterconditioning to help your dog overcome fear and anxiety associated with car rides.
"
"Start by just sitting in the car with your dog for a few minutes and not driving anywhere. When your dog is successful with that, try going for a ride of less than 5 minutes, and gradually extend the length of the trip as your dog becomes used to the idea of car rides being safe and even fun.
"
"As more families travel with their dogs, keeping everyone safe and comfortable has become more important. With a little time and patience, road trips can be another way to keep the whole family connected and to expand your dog’s horizons.

"
"There are many products marketed to reduce fear and anxiety and provide generalized calming effects in dogs, and you may find the array of options dizzying.
"
"While some pet parents swear by certain dog calming products and report them to be useful in dogs with mild to moderate anxiety, few products have been tested and proven through scientific research to reduce anxiety in pets. When scientific studies have been performed, many of these studies are of lower rigor.
"
"If you elect to use one or more of these products, keep in mind that the placebo effect may lead pet parents to perceive benefits in treatments that in reality are ineffective. This could delay treatments that actually work.
"
"Here are the facts about some popular dog calming products that can help ease your dog’s anxiety.
"
"When you read about research on a certain dog calming product, know that some studies may have been performed on the functional ingredient in a product, not on the product itself. Also, the studies may have been performed on rats and mice, not on dogs and cats.
"
"While the amount of scientific information on non-pharmaceutical calming products in dogs is increasing, there isn’t much data on the quality, safety, and efficacy for the majority of products.
"
"Another thing to note is that unlike the US Food and Drug Administration’s testing of supplements for people, there’s no standardized monitoring system for pet behavioral supplements. This can lead to differences in ingredients, purity, quality, and efficacy between manufacturers and between batches.
"
"This is why it is important to discuss with your veterinarian starting any supplement, even if you can buy it over the counter, before giving it to your pet.
"
"Behavioral supplements may include calming treats, herbal supplements, dietary supplements, and calming diets. Here are some of the common ingredients found in these products, along with scientific research on whether they reduce anxiety in dogs.
"
"Alpha-casozepine is a lactose-free derivative of a protein in cows’ milk. Some research studies have suggested that this derivative helps reduce anxiety in dogs by acting on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain that produces a calming effect.
"
"Alpha-casozepine has been shown to potentially reduce anxiety and fear of strangers in dogs.
"
"But although it is sometimes administered for situational stress, such as during fireworks or vet visits, there is no evidence that it has any short-term effect.
"
"Where to find it:
"
"Alpha-casozepine is found in Zylkene® (Vetoquinol®) and is one of the main ingredients in some veterinary calming diets. Zylkene comes in capsules that can be given whole or opened and mixed with your dog’s food.
"
"Melatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland of the brain. It’s secreted in high levels during the night and low levels during the day. Thus, it plays an important role in regulating the body’s natural wake/sleep cycle (circadian rhythm).
"
"There is some evidence in humans that melatonin may help reduce anxiety and promote sedation before medical procedures. Side effects in humans can include sleepiness, headaches, and gastrointestinal upset.
"
"Melatonin supplements have been used to reduce situational fear and anxiety and dogs, such as during veterinary visits, thunderstorms, and fireworks, as well as to promote sleep in dogs who are restless overnight. However, scientific evidence is lacking.
"
"Where to find it:
"
"It comes in tablet and capsule formulations, as well as dissolvable and/or flavored chewables. Make sure that any melatonin product does not contain xylitol, a class of sweetener that is highly toxic dogs. Melatonin appears safe to combine with other medications or supplements.
"
"L-theanine is an amino acid derived from the tea plant. It is thought to help decrease anxiety and improve mental function by modulating GABA, serotonin, and dopamine, and by inhibiting glutamate, which is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain.
"
"There have been several veterinary studies that showed L-theanine to have benefits in dogs, including reducing fear of strangers, noise phobia, and storm phobia.
"
"Where to find it:
"
"L-theanine can be found in Solliquin® (Nutramax®) chews, Composure® (Vetriscience®) chews, and Anxitane (Virbac) tablets. Supplements containing L-theanine are intended to be used on a daily basis and may require 4-6 weeks to have therapeutic effect.
"
"L-tryptophan is an amino acid precursor for the formation of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Serotonin is key to the regulation of many behavioral processes, including emotion, mood, aggression, and anxiety. Studies have suggested that there may be an association between the metabolism of L-tryptophan and fear in dogs.
"
"Where to find it:
"
"L-tryptophan has been added to some veterinary calming diets. One research study showed that one of these diets (which also contains alpha-casozepine) helped dogs to better cope with stress, while another study showed no effect on the dogs’ anxiety levels.
"
"Valerian is a plant that may help pets sleep through the night and may ease anxiety. However, controlled research studies are not available.
"
"Where to find it:
"
"One study found that pet parents reported that the Pet Remedy diffuser, which contains valerian, reduced the intensity, but not the frequency, of anxiety-related behaviors. As with some other products, it may take several weeks before pet parents can see any therapeutic effect.
"
"Magnolia officinalis is a flowering herb that has been shown to have an anti-anxiety affect in mice, and Phellodendron amurense is a bark extract that has been shown to protect the brain from the effects of stress and prevent mood disorders. Studies have shown both magnolia and phellodendron to reduce fear-related signs during thunderstorms.
"
"Where to find it:
"
"Solliquin (Nutramax) chews contain a combination of magnolia and phellodendron extracts.
"
"The gut microbiome, which consists of diverse populations of intestinal bacteria, has been associated with several behavioral problems in dogs, including fear and anxiety-related disorders.
"
"According to a blinded, placebo-controlled study conducted at the Purina Pet Care Center, the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum BL999 reduced anxious behaviors such as excessive vocalization, jumping, pacing, and spinning in a small population of Labrador Retrievers.
"
"Where to find it:
"
"You can find Bifidobacterium longum BL999 in Purina Pro Plan Calming Care. It comes in individual packets of flavorful powder that is mixed daily with your dog’s food. It can take up to 6 weeks to take effect.
"
"Pheromones are chemicals that are detected by a special organ in dogs, the vomeronasal organ. Pheromones affect parts of the brain that lead to changes in behavioral and emotional responses. When female dogs nurse their puppies, they release dog-appeasing pheromone (DAP) from their mammary glands. This has a calming effect on the puppies.
"
"The effectiveness of DAP in reducing fear and anxiety in dogs is supported by quite a bit of scientific evidence. Research studies suggest that DAP may help reduce anxiety in numerous situations: changes in the household, car travel, boarding, veterinary visits, moving to a new home, when a new puppy is introduced to the home, in cases of separation-related disorders, and noise phobias, including thunderstorms and fireworks.
"
"However, many of these studies are limited by their methodological quality. Furthermore, in some of these studies, other treatments, such as behavior modification, were also implemented at the same time as DAP. This does not mean that potential benefits of pheromone therapy should be discounted, but further research is necessary to better understand the potential benefits of DAP.
"
"Where to find it:
"
"Synthetic DAP is sold in collars, sprays, or diffusers. Pheromones are species-specific; in other words, the pheromones of one species will only affect other members of that species. The same is true for synthetic pheromones.
"
"Adaptil® (Ceva) spray can be applied to a crate or kennel or sprayed in a vehicle. The spray contains an alcohol base with an odor that dogs may not like, so spray it and wait at least 15 minutes before exposing your dog to that space, so the odor can dissipate. The effects last about 4-5 hours.
"
"Adaptil® plug-in diffusers aerosolize the pheromone up to 700 square feet, and the Adaptil® collar and Sentry®’s Calming Collar evaporate the pheromone. Both the diffusers and collars last for about 30 days.
"
"Pressure vests or jackets for dogs are fitted to use pressure points to ease fear or phobias, such as during thunderstorms or fireworks. They are like a hug for dogs.
"
"Like many other calming products, scientific research on the efficacy of these products is limited and inconclusive. A couple of studies found potential benefits of pressure vests for thunderstorm phobias and for separation anxiety in dogs, but the studies were of variable quality.
"
"Subjectively, many of the pet parents in these studies believed that the pressure vests had positive effects on their dog’s anxiety levels.
"
"These products may have small but beneficial effects on canine anxiety and are probably worth trying. For some pets, wearing an anxiety vest may actually be fear-provoking or discomforting, so do not force your dog to wear a product if they seem uncomfortable.
"
"Pressure vests are meant to fit snugly but to not be restrictive. For proper fit, see that you can slip two fingers with ease underneath the vests. Pets should never be left unsupervised while wearing a vest, jacket, or cape.
"
"Dog Anxiety Vests to Try
"
"One dog anxiety vest that is popular with pet parents, according to some reviews, is ThunderShirt®, which comes in a variety of sizes.
"
"Food toys and puzzles can distract dogs from stressful events and promote soothing alternative behaviors, such as foraging and licking. In other words, they can give dogs something else to do besides worry!
"
"Food toys are most effective when a dog’s triggers for anxiety can be identified, such as thunderstorms, fireworks, or visitors coming into the home. A food toy is best given in a safe space that is quiet and away from the stressor. You can give it to your dog just before the onset of stressful events, to divert their attention from the trigger and prevent their anxiety from escalating.
"
"If you repeatedly pair something positive, like a food toy, with something negative, like a stressor, your dog will be more likely to form positive associations with their triggers over time. However, if a dog’s anxiety is too high, then they may not be interested in food.
"
"Food and Puzzle Toys to Try
"
"There are a multitude of food toys and puzzles available. Look for products that take 15 minutes  or more for dogs to finish or solve, and that are not so difficult that they might cause frustration. Here are some good options:
"
"Lick mats
"
"A KONG® or Zogoflex® stuffed with a dog’s favorite food
"
"Snuffle mats (a mat with spaces to hide food and treats to encourage sniffing and foraging behaviors)
"
"Slow feeders
"
"Problem-solving puzzles
"
"Freezing the food in these products will make them last longer. Stash several food toys in the freezer so you are prepared before predictable stressful events, like fireworks or storms.
"
"For puppies, a stuffed toy with a heartbeat and heat pack may provide calming effects when the pet is left alone.
"
"Discuss treatment options with your veterinarian or a veterinary behaviorist. This helps ensure that you choose products that are safe and effective for your pet.
"
"Veterinarians will also evaluate your pet for a potential physical problem that may be causing or contributing to their anxiety. Calming products almost certainly will not help if an underlying medical disorder is present.

"Fleas are the most common external parasite found on dogs and cats worldwide. Flea allergy dermatitis (known as FAD) is the most common dermatologic disease in domestic dogs in the United States. A study has shown a 13% increase in FAD in dogs over the last decade.1
"
"It can be a very frustrating condition for you and a very uncomfortable condition for your dog. However, it is preventable and treatable.
"
"Here’s what you need to know about flea allergies in dogs—from how they start to treatment and prevention.
"
"Fleas take their first blood meal on the host (your dog) within minutes of contact.2 When a flea feeds, it injects its saliva into your dog’s skin. This saliva contains enzymes, peptides, and amino acids. It also contains histamine-like compounds that trigger a release from the dog’s immune system.
"
"Flea saliva can cause an inflammatory reaction in animals that are sensitive to it. Some dogs have an immediate hypersensitivity to it within 15 minutes, while others have a delayed reaction that takes 24-48 hours.
"
"Dogs with atopic dermatitis are more likely predisposed to developing flea allergy dermatitis (FAD).1
"
"Just because you don’t see the fleas, it does not mean they aren’t there.
"
"A common misconception is that fleas are only a concern during warmer months. This is not true. Another misconception is that fleas can’t come inside your house. Fleas can live indoors as eggs, larvae, and pupae, and pets and humans can also bring fleas inside.
"
"You may not see the fleas right away, but you will see the evidence of the allergic reaction. Even one flea bite can cause this allergic reaction.
"
"When dogs feel flea bites, they often chew and bite at their rear by their tail and/or jump up from a resting position. If you see itching in your dog, and it leads to hair loss on the middle of the back to the tail base, you need to think flea allergy dermatitis. The hair loss can spread all over the body, up to the head and neck if left untreated.
"
"When a dog scratches, licks, and chews, it breaks the skin barrier and can cause open sores and scabs. The licking and chewing can also cause ongoing moisture that can lead to yeast and bacterial infections.
"

"
"It is important to get a true diagnosis when a dog is itching severely.
"
"Your vet will first look for any evidence of fleas or flea dirt (which is the flea excrement), sometimes using a fine-tooth comb.
"
"It is common that a pet parent may not see the fleas at home on the pet, but veterinary staff are trained flea detectives who work hard to find them.
"
"Tests can also be done to determine the underlying cause of the allergic reaction. Vets use blood tests and skin tests for flea allergies.
"
"Skin testing, called intradermal testing, is usually performed by a veterinary dermatologist. A wheal (bump on the skin) forms on the skin, usually within 15-20 minutes of injected a small amount of an allergen into the skin.3
"
"Blood testing can also be done in most general veterinary practices to test the IgE directed against the flea-specific salivary antigens.
"
"There is often a secondary infection that develops on a dog’s skin with FAD. Your vet can use cytology to diagnose any secondary skin infections.
"
"Cutaneous cytology is a valuable diagnostic tool. Using a piece of tape to collect a surface sample from a skin lesion helps determine the type of microbial population as well as the inflammatory component present.4
"
"It is quick and inexpensive. This helps guide the doctor to prescribe the most appropriate and effective treatment for the patient.
"
"The number one priority in FAD treatment is to kill the fleas! This means to kill them not only on your dog, but on all pets in the household and killing fleas in the environment.
"
"Oral flea medications are going to provide the quickest demise of the fleas.
"
"You can use a product containing Spinosad to kill all fleas on your dog within 30-60 minutes to give the quickest relief. Then you can follow up with a product that lasts 30-90 days.
"
"Once the fleas are dead, it is a good idea to bathe the dog to get off all of the dead bugs and their excrement. You can get a medicated shampoo prescribed by your vet to soothe the skin, or you can find over-the-counter dog shampoos that contain oatmeal and pramoxine to help soothe the itch.
"
"After the fleas are eradicated, you still need to treat the skin irritation caused by the allergic dermatitis.
"
"In mild cases, you can treat your dog with Benadryl at home to stop the allergic reaction and provide relief from the itch.
"
"Always check with your veterinarian for dosing instructions and to make sure this medication is safe for your pet.
"
"Most dogs with FAD need more help, and you can talk to your veterinarian about the need for steroids or other allergy meds such as Apoquel or Cytopoint.
"
"As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention goes a long way. Preventing, reducing, and eliminating flea infestations is crucial to preventing recurring FAD.
"
"Just treating your pet without treating the environment is only 50% of the problem. Indoor flea eradication measures include vacuuming (carpets, cushioned furniture, cracks and crevices on floors, and baseboards) and washing pet bedding in hot soapy water.
"
"Outdoor areas need attention, such as shaded areas around the house or your dog’s kennel or favorite sleeping area. You can use premise sprays for fleas indoors and out. For both the house and yard, you may need to contact an exterminator for the best method of flea removal.
"
"There are many flea prevention products on the market. Work with your veterinarian to pick the one that is best for your dog.
"
"The oral medications in the isoxazoline category have been the most recent group that has been extremely effective and safe for most dogs. Talk to your vet to make sure your dog doesn’t have any contraindications such as seizures.
"
"If you keep the flea population under control, you can spare your pet pain and suffering. It can take three months to rid your house of an infestation. It is time-consuming and expensive.
"
"Prevent what you can to keep your dog flea-free!

"Distichiasis in dogs is one of several conditions in which a dog has abnormal eyelash growth.
"
"In this case, the eyelash grows out of the opening of a meibomian gland on the eyelid margin rather than growing out of the regular lash line. The meibomian glands are along the inside margin of the eyelid and produce part of the eye’s tear film. When a hair grows out of the gland, the hair can rub on the cornea (clear outer layer of the eyeball), causing irritation.
"
"One eyelash growing out of the meibomian gland is called a distichia (plural is distichiae). Usually, there are multiple distichiae and both eyes are usually affected. Most dogs with distichiasis develop the condition at a young age, often before turning 1 year old.
"
"If you look closely, you can usually see the abnormal eyelashes lying against the cornea. Some dogs may have thicker lashes that can be seen from a distance, while others may have just a few thin hairs that have to been viewed up-close to notice. If the eyelashes are soft, they may not bother your dog.
"
"In some cases, course or stubby eyelashes can cause a lot of irritation to the eyes as they poke at the corneas. Other similar eyelash conditions that cause irritation to the cornea are ectopic cilia or trichiasis. An ectopic cilium is an eyelash that grows through the inside of the eyelid toward the cornea rather than coming out of a gland opening. Trichiasis occurs when hairs from a normal location are directed at the cornea, such as a normal eyelash that curls in or long hairs from the muzzle that poke the eye.
"
"Distichiasis is a common condition in dogs, so it should be considered if your dog has chronically irritated eyes.
"
"Symptoms of distichiasis in dogs include:
"
"Eyelashes from the eyelid margin lying across the cornea
"
"Tearing (epiphora) from the eye
"
"Excessive blinking, squinting, or difficulty keeping the eye open

"Canine distemper is a highly contagious, often fatal viral disease that affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), nervous system, and other organs of dogs.
"
"Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated dogs and puppies are at highest risk.
"
"This disease primarily spreads from one dog to another through direct contact, such as coughing and sneezing. 
"
"Distemper doesn’t just affect dogs. Infected ferrets and wildlife—foxes, wolves, raccoons, skunks, coyotes, and other carnivores—can also become sick and transmit the virus to dogs.

"
"Distichiasis occurs due to chronic inflammation within the meibomian glands. Development of distichiae can be spontaneous but it is also likely to have a genetic component.  
"
"Breeds predisposed to distichiasis include:
"
"Shih Tzu
"
"Cocker Spaniels
"
"Golden Retrievers
"
"English Bulldogs
"
"Veterinarians can usually diagnose distichiasis with a physical exam alone. However, if your veterinarian suspects other eyelid abnormalities or is having trouble examining the eyelid margin due to your pet’s behavior or excessive blinking, sedation may be needed.
"
"If your veterinarian suspects an ulcer on the eye, they may apply a special stain called fluorescein and look at the eye with a blue light to see if there is an injury to the cornea.
"
"Your veterinarian might also place a numbing eyedrop into the eye to make examination easier and provide temporary relief for your dog.
"
"If distichiasis isn’t causing any irritation for your dog, then treatment isn’t necessary. With mild cases, the veterinarian may recommend a lubricating gel or ointment to help reduce irritation.
"
"They may also try plucking the abnormal hairs to see if the irritation resolves. This would usually require sedation. If the irritation goes away after plucking and recurs with hair regrowth, then the corneal irritation is due to the distichiae.
"
"Hairs will usually regrow within four to six weeks. Keep in mind that eyelash growth may be stubbier, so that new growth may increase the risk of corneal abrasion or ulcers.
"
"Distemper in dogs can be prevented through a core vaccine given by a licensed veterinarian. All dogs should remain current on this vaccine throughout their lives.
"
"Fortunately, due to widespread vaccination against distemper, the disease is less common than it once was.  
"
"Distemper in dogs can become serious very quickly, which is why it’s important to bring your dog to a veterinarian promptly if you suspect this disease.
"
"The earlier treatment is started, the better the chance for recovery.
"
"If left untreated, distemper in dogs is often fatal, especially in puppies.  
"
"Distemper in dogs initially causes the following symptoms:
"

"Some dogs only appear to have a minor cold with eye and nasal discharge, while others may have no symptoms at all.
"
"As the disease progresses, dogs can develop:
"
"Tremors
"
"Chewing motions of the jaw
"
"Seizures
"
"Partial or complete paralysis
"
"Pneumonia
"
"Crusting of the nose and foot pads
"
"Severe vomiting and diarrhea
"
"For more permanent removal, your veterinarian will recommend cryotherapy (freezing the affected area), electrolysis (using an electric current to kill the hair follicle), or surgical removal. These procedures are done under general anesthesia.
"
"Surgical removal is an option only if there are only a few offending lashes in a small area. Surgery carries the risk of causing eyelid deformity. Both electrolysis and cryotherapy may require more than one session to address all distichiae.
"
"If your dog doesn’t need surgery at this time, watch for signs that could indicate the eyelash has started bothering them, such as discharge from the eye or squinting.
"
"After any procedure involving the eye, it’s important that you prevent your pet from either scratching their eye or rubbing it on surfaces. A recovery cone should be worn for at least seven to 10 days.
"
"Unfortunately, doughnut-type e-collars may not work well for your dog recovering from an eye procedure, as they can still rub their eye on the floor or furniture. You’ll want to select a recovery collar that is cone-shaped and follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for how long to keep it on.
"
"Your veterinarian may also prescribe antibiotic and/or anti-inflammatory eyedrops to prevent infection or reduce pain after the procedure.
"
"Once the hairs have been permanently removed, your dog has a good prognosis.
"
"You cannot prevent your dog from getting distichiasis, but it’s recommended to avoid breeding dogs with distichiasis to reduce incidence in future generations.

"Distemper is transmitted mainly through respiratory secretions (coughing and sneezing) but other bodily fluids like urine, vomit, and stool can also contain the virus.
"
"Contact with an infected animal is the most common way for distemper to spread, but shared food bowls and contaminated supplies, surfaces, and equipment can also pose a risk.
"
"Dogs, ferrets, and wildlife can appear healthy and still be a source of the distemper virus. Recovered dogs may remain contagious for several months.
"
"At this time, there is no evidence that humans can get canine distemper.
"
"However, ferrets are also at risk for being infected with the canine distemper virus and should be vaccinated against it.
"
"
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will start with a thorough physical exam to check for abnormalities, such as eye or nose discharge, abnormal lung or heart sounds, and signs of dehydration.
"
"Your vet will want to know when symptoms began, whether your dog is up to date on his distemper vaccine, and if he has been in close contact with any other animals recently.
"
"If symptoms and history align with distemper, your veterinarian can do diagnostic testing like PCR to detect the actual virus or antibody tests to determine a dog’s exposure to the virus.
"
"Depending on the test chosen, various samples can be used including to the blood, urine, and eye or nose discharge.
"
"Your veterinarian will determine the appropriate samples to collect to receive an accurate diagnosis.  
"
"Treatment for distemper in dogs consists of supportive care of symptoms and can vary.
"
"The most common treatments are:
"
"Gastrointestinal support for severe diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration.
"
"Many cases require intravenous (IV) fluid therapy (to treat and prevent dehydration), anti-vomiting medications, and antibiotics.
"
"Canine distemper virus can weaken the immune system, causing secondary bacterial infections, septicemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and in some cases, death.
"
"Respiratory support for severe pneumonia. Many dogs have trouble breathing and experience severe coughing.
"
"Some of these symptoms can be life-threatening and may require oxygen therapy, antibiotics, and hospitalization.
"
"Neurological support for seizures. These seizures can last several minutes, which can lead to irreversible brain damage and even death.
"
"Dogs with seizures caused by distemper may require hospitalization and monitoring along with anti-seizure medications.
"
"In severe cases, humane euthanasia may be considered if the disease has progressed and treatment is not effectively controlling symptoms.
"
"Dogs can survive distemper, but they may develop lifelong, debilitating effects from the disease.
"
"Distemper can cause chronic seizures and muscle twitches.
"
"Neurologic symptoms may develop weeks or months after a dog has been infected with distemper virus and last for the rest of a dog’s life.
"
"Dogs with distemper can be contagious for several months.
"
"It’s important that a dog with distemper be isolated from other animals until he has fully recovered and is no longer deemed contagious by a veterinarian.
"
"This is to reduce the spread of the virus to other vulnerable animals.
"
"Thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting household items—such as bedding and dog bowls—is essential to remove the virus from home.
"
"Dogs recovering from distemper should attend all follow-up veterinary appointments to support optimal health and well-being. Some dogs benefit from appetite stimulants, such as Entyce™, during recovery.
"
"Vaccination for distemper in dogs is crucial—it’s the best way to prevent this disease.
"
"It's important that a veterinarian perform this vaccination to ensure quality control, safe handling (accounting for temperature-controlled shipping and storage), and proper administration.
"
"Vaccines stimulate the immune system to provide protection against disease.
"
"Most dogs show no side effects from vaccination, but pups can become sore at the injection site or develop a mild fever. In rare cases, allergic reactions can occur.
"
"Speak to your veterinarian about the benefits and risks involved with vaccinations.

"Dog acne is inflammation of the lips and the skin of the muzzle, which can appear as red bumps or pimples on the skin. Acne may begin as folliculitis, which is when short hairs push below the skin’s surface and become inflamed. 
"
"Acne may also occur due to furunculosis, which is when the hair follicle under the skin (also known as muzzle folliculitis and furunculosis) becomes painful, infected, and inflamed, often filled with pus. This occurs when short hairs on the surface of the skin break and are pushed below the skin surface in the follicle.  
"
"In both these cases, there is trauma to the tissues, and it can create a chronic condition in which secondary bacterial or fungal infections can complicate the process. 
"
"This condition is fairly common in young, short, coated breeds of dogs.   
"
"Dog acne most commonly appears on the bottom of the chin, skin around the mouth, and lower lips. It can look like red bumps, hairless areas, and swelling of the muzzle. As the condition progresses, the bumps can become infected, grow, ooze, or drain fluid.
"
"Although the cause of dog acne is often unknown, possible factors include: 
"
"Dog shoulder dislocation (luxation of the shoulder) happens when the upper bone in a dog’s front leg (just above the elbow) is knocked out of its normal position in relation to their shoulder blade. The shoulder joint can be partially out of place (subluxated) or completely out of place (luxated).
"
"The most common symptom of a dislocated shoulder in dogs is limping, which can come on suddenly (acute) or progress slowly over a longer term. After a traumatic accident, the dog may not want to put any weight on the affected limb.
"
"Dogs that have been injured for a long time may be limping but are still able to bear weight on the affected limb. Dogs that have a malformed shoulder from birth may not even limp.
"
"Dogs’ shoulders can be dislocated through trauma, such as a car accident or a fall. A dog might also be born with a malformed shoulder due to a congenital condition.
"
"When a dog’s shoulder is dislocated due to trauma, the joint capsule tears, and damage is caused to various ligaments, tendons, and muscles that support and stabilize the joint.
"
"While the shoulder joint can dislocate in any direction, dislocation to the inside (medial) or to the outside (lateral) of the joint are most common.
"
"Medial dislocations can occur as a result of trauma in any breed, and as a congenital condition in small and miniature breed dogs.
"
"Lateral dislocations occur most commonly as a result of trauma in large breed dogs.
"
"Your vet will feel your dog’s leg and shoulder; if the pain is localized to the shoulder region, they will perform a more thorough inspection of the joint.
"
"The veterinarian may detect that the shoulders do not feel symmetrical and that the bones in the affected shoulder are out of place compared to the normal shoulder. There may be inflammation, grinding, or instability when the affected shoulder is felt.
"
"Your vet will then perform X-rays to confirm the diagnosis of a dislocated shoulder and look for evidence of fracture or joint damage. Arthroscopy, or examining the joint with a camera, can be performed under anesthesia if X-rays do not help with a diagnosis.

"We've all heard the saying that eating carrots can help improve vision. But does this apply to our dogs as well? While there is some hint of truth in the concept, eating bushels of carrots will not give your dog (or you) super vision during the day (or night).
"
"Carrots are indeed a nutrient-rich source for a variety of vitamins and minerals, including beta-carotene, a pigment that gives carrots and other vegetables their signature orange (or sometimes yellow or red) color. It is the beginning form of vitamin A (called retinal) that is necessary to maintain good vision — especially in dim light.
"
"When your dog eats foods containing beta-carotene, it is absorbed by the intestine and transported to the liver. There it is combined with fats in the diet, converted to vitamin A, and stored until it is required by the body. When called upon, it is released through the bloodstream, and from there travelling to the retina of the eye.
"
"The retina is critical for normal eyesight. Found in the back of the eyeball, it is made up of millions of cells called rods and cones. These cells are sensitive to light and use vitamin A to tell the brain (via the optic nerve) what is being seen. The rods are most important in low-light situations, and the rods are sensitive to low levels of vitamin A in the body. So, if your dog has a deficiency of vitamin A, eating more foods that contain beta-carotene could help improve eyesight, especially at night.
"
"Beta-carotene also works as an antioxidant, helping to prevent disease and infection. Its role as a precursor of vitamin A makes it important for healthy skin and hair coat, normal bone development, reproductive health, general eye health, and cancer prevention.
"
"Carrots are not the only source of this important nutrient in your dog’s diet. Ingredients such as liver, eggs, sweet potato, spinach and broccoli also contain beta-carotene. Vitamin A and beta-carotene are also created synthetically and added to dog food to make sure the levels provided are adequate for daily nutrition.
"
"There is, however, such a thing as having too much vitamin A in the diet. Dogs that have too much in their diet (hypervitaminosis) can develop bone problems and muscle weakness. Thankfully, reaching a toxic level of vitamin A would require a very high dose over a long period of time, and giving your dog a few carrots now and again isn’t going to come close to providing an overdose. If you do choose to give your dog carrots as an occasional treat, it's best to cut them up into small enough pieces to reduce the risk of choking or gastrointestinal discomfort.

"Skin damage from rough play or rubbing the face on a rough surface 
"
"Itching and rubbing triggered by an underlying skin allergy 
"
"Age (most dogs with chin acne are between 6 months and a year old) 
"
"Short hair breeds, such as Boxer, Doberman Pinscher, English Bulldog, Great Dane, Weimaraner, English Mastiff, Rottweiler, and German Short Haired Pointer 
"
"Dog acne is unique in that typically the only area of the dog affected is the muzzle.  
"
"In many cases, the cause of acne is unknown. Some possible causes are localized trauma from rough play or rubbing face on carpet or on rough surfaces. Some pets itch and rub from underlying skin allergies (that affect many parts of the body), and this can complicate or cause the initial acne flare. Not all dogs of the short haired breeds develop chin acne, so it’s likely genetics and environmental causes play a role in this condition.  
"
"It is important to schedule a visit with your veterinarian if you believe your dog has developed acne and is exhibiting any of the above symptoms.   
"
"Your veterinarian will want to rule out other conditions, such as: 
"
"Demodicosis: A type of mange that is typically diagnosed through an examine of skin scrapings under a microscope. 
"
"Ringworm: In its early stages this fungus resembles acne, so your veterinarian will pluck several hairs for a culture. It typically takes 10 to 14 days to determine whether there is a fungal infection. 
"
"Puppy Strangles: A skin disorder that appears in puppies and can resemble acne.  
"
"Typically, your veterinarian will do a thorough examination and ask for history regarding diet, treats, supplements, and home environment (your vet may ask about the types of dishes used for pets or whether other pets are in the home). Some pets can have a contact reaction to plastic bowls. Also, it is possible that contamination of bacteria or yeast can hide in micro scratches on plastic dishes.  
"
"Your vet may also take skin samples to look for secondary bacteria, yeast, or Demodex mites and possibly order a dermatophyte fungal culture. A bacterial culture may be taken if the acne shows signs of draining to identify the type of bacteria. 
"
"In rare cases, a biopsy may be performed to check deep disease, unusual lesions, or cases not responding to therapy.
"
"Treatment of dog acne can include medication, dietary changes, and behavioral therapy.  
"
"Your veterinarian may prescribe topical or oral medications to reduce inflammation and fight any bacterial infection, if necessary. Medications can include: 
"
"Anti-inflammatories 
"
"Antibiotics 
"
"Antifungals 
"
"Your vet may suggest behavioral therapy to help your dog avoid injuring the area from rough play or rubbing their face on rough surfaces. Your vet may also recommend how to properly clean the infected area to prevent secondary infections. Additionally, a topical spray such as Vetericyn® Plus may be recommended to provide soothing relief. 
"
"If your vet finds that your dog has an underlying allergy, they may suggest diet therapy, supplements, and allergy medications (prescription or over-the-counter).
"
"Most dogs with acne recover with proper treatment but do require management, which may include preventing recurring trauma, using topical medications during flare ups, and long-term allergy management if necessary. Some severe cases can result in scarring and can be prone to lesion recurrence.
"
"If your dog’s shoulder dislocation is due to recent trauma, your veterinarian may attempt to pop the shoulder back into place under general anesthesia, which is called a closed reduction.
"
"If the shoulder joint stays in place, a bandage-type sling or splint is placed for about 14 days, depending on whether the dislocation is to the inside or outside of the shoulder joint.
"
"If this does not work and your dog’s shoulder dislocates again, then your dog will need surgery. The type of surgical procedure will depend on the type of dislocation and the surgeon’s preferred technique. After surgery, your dog’s limb will usually be bandaged and/or splinted for about 14 days.
"
"After your dog’s shoulder dislocation is treated through surgery or popping it back into place, you must restrict your dog’s activity while maximizing rest. Your veterinarian will establish a time frame for exercise restriction and a plan for returning to normal activity.
"
"During the recovery period, your dog will likely be on pain medication(s). Some veterinary clinics offer physical therapy, which may be helpful in both nonsurgical and postsurgical patients. This may include laser therapy, passive range of motion exercises, and hydrotherapy.  
"
"Because a shoulder dislocation in dogs often results in significant soft tissue damage, this type of injury can take a few months to heal. A good recovery plan involving physical therapy techniques may speed healing time.

"At high levels of beta-carotene supplementation, the pigment may cause your dog's skin (or white hair) to turn yellowish or orange in color. Dogs with red or brown hair coats may develop a darker color hair coat at higher levels of ingestion. Once the high levels of beta-carotene are reduced, the color will go away quickly.
"
"While feeding your dog carrots or buying dog foods that contain sources of beta-carotene can provide health benefits, there is not much chance of your pet's eyesight becoming better than it was before. That said, there is little chance that beta-carotene supplementation will improve diminished eyesight caused by injury, cataracts, glaucoma, etc. However, beta-carotene has even been shown to prevent cataracts and other eye diseases when used prophylactically.

"Behavioral modification to limit contact with rough surfaces or rough play can help limit hair breakage. Keeping the chin area clean and dry can help prevent secondary infections.
"
"Because the follicle becomes inflamed when the broken hair is pushed deep under the skin, dog chin acne usually requires some form of treatment. The treatment may be mild to significant depending on the individual case. Some dogs with a deep skin infection (pyoderma) may require several months on medications.
"
"Most often dog acne is not contagious. If there is a secondary bacterial or fungal infection, the chance of spreading the infection is minimal.

"When a dog has a dislocated hip, also known as a coxofemoral luxation, the ball part of the joint comes out of the socket. Dislocation disrupts and can damage the joint capsule (an outer layer of tough fibrous tissue that stabilizes the hip joint), in addition to the ligaments, muscle, and bones of the hip.   
"
"Dislocated hips in dogs are extremely painful. Dogs typically cannot bear weight on their back leg, often limping and carrying it so it will not touch the ground. The affected leg may appear shorter than the others. The hip joint may also look swollen and be warm to the touch.   
"
"A dislocated hip in dogs is most commonly caused by trauma, such as being hit by a car. However, degenerative joint disease (arthritis or osteoarthritis), Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (or avascular necrosis of the femoral head), or hip dysplasia (malformation of the hip socket) also increases the risk.   
"
"Often there is a history of trauma or injury that makes a veterinarian suspicious of a hip luxation in dogs. These dogs are x-rayed to check the positioning of their hips and confirm the luxation. 
"
"In most cases, the bone slides forward and up (craniodorsal displacement), but the opposite can happen (ventrocaudal displacement). Knowing the position of the bones helps your vet correct the problem. 
"
"X-rays also provide additional information about the hip status that can be important in selecting therapy. One example is when you have fractures of the pelvis or leg that would interfere with correcting the dog’s hip luxation. 
"
"Sometimes when ligaments tear during hip luxation in dogs, a bone chip can come off as well. If the luxated hip were popped into place with a bone chip in the joint, this would cause painful bone-on-bone grinding. Instead, the bone chip should be surgically trimmed. 
"
"Another helpful piece of information found in the x-ray is if your dog has hip dysplasia (a malformation of the hip socket, making it too shallow to support the ball of the hip) or Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, a condition in which disrupted blood flow to the femur where it meets the pelvis leads to death of the bone cells.          
"
"These cases warrant special consideration because manual joint replacement is unlikely to be successful, which means surgical correction is most likely needed. 
"
"If you suspect that your dog has dislocated their hip, take them immediately to the emergency vet. 
"
"There are two main approaches to correcting a dog’s dislocated hip: closed reduction (nonsurgical) and open reduction (surgical). 
"
"Closed reduction is the nonsurgical technique that a veterinarian uses to put your dog’s hip back in place manually. It is referred to as closed because you are not “opening” the joint with surgery. 
"
"To have the best chance of success with a closed reduction, the vet will make sure that your dog’s hip appears as normal as possible aside from the dislocation, meaning no fractures and minimal hip dysplasia.  
"
"To further maximize the chances of success, the closed reduction should be attempted as soon as possible after the dislocation. If you wait any longer than one or two days, muscle contraction will occur that makes the reduction procedure much more difficult.  
"
"Since this procedure is painful and the muscles need to be relaxed, it needs to be attempted under general anesthesia. The dog’s femoral head, the highest part of the thigh bone, is manipulated back into the joint manually and then X-rayed to confirm it is in place. 
"
"Once the hip joint is restored, a special support called an Ehmer sling is placed. The sling prevents your dog from using the leg and provides an angle that encourages the hip to remain in place.  
"
"Your dog needs to wear the sling for 10-14 days at home with frequent rechecks with your veterinarian, and be confined to a crate for an additional two to four weeks afterward. 
"
"If successful, a closed reduction is a good noninvasive option. However, closed reductions to correct hip dislocation in dogs are only successful 50% of the time – meaning that the other 50% of the time, the hip will pop back out, and surgery will be needed.  
"
"Still, most veterinarians agree it is worth the effort to attempt closed reduction for a dog’s hip luxation before jumping to surgery.   
"
"If closed reduction fails or is deemed inadvisable because of trauma, fractures, or hip dysplasia, the vet will need to perform an open reduction. This means surgery to put your dog’s hip back into its normal position and stabilize it. 
"
"There are several techniques to accomplish this. The simplest approach to an open reduction is when the hip luxation only created a small tear in the joint capsule. The hip can be put back into place and the joint capsule can be sewn back together. 
"
"However, in cases where the joint capsule is too damaged, the joint may need to be reconstructed with a toggle pin or other implant to keep the femur in place. Each case is different, so the veterinary surgeon will decide the best approach for your dog.  
"
"Post-operation, an Ehmer sling will likely be applied for approximately one week, followed by a few weeks to months of crate confinement and physical therapy. 
"
"The success rate for open reduction is 85-90%, with a good range of motion and return to normal activity expected.   
"
"There are cases, however, where open reduction is not an option for treating a dog’s dislocated hip because of existing arthritis, severe hip dysplasia, or severe trauma to the area.
"
"In these situations, restoration of the normal hip joint is not possible, so the surgeon may need to do a femoral head osteotomy (FHO). 
"
"This procedure eliminates the pain involved with bone-on-bone contact by removing the femoral head (ball) altogether. In this case, a false joint will develop in the soft tissues, allowing nearly normal function of the leg. 
"
"This technique will also require post-operative crate rest followed by physical therapy, but it does eliminate the risk of recurrent dislocation or the complications associated with implants.   
"
"Post-operative care will be based largely on how your dog was injured to cause the hip luxation (for example, if the dog was hit by a car). However, most recovery will include time spent in an Ehmer sling and crate rest, followed by physical therapy.  
"
"Typical recovery can involve up to six to eight weeks of restricted activity. Your veterinarian will customize a recovery plan for your dog. 
"
"Initially, your vet will likely prescribe anti-inflammatory medications to reduce pain and swelling, but in the long run, a joint supplement will be recommended to help maintain joint health and combat arthritis.  
"
"Another important aspect of long-term recovery from hip luxation in dogs is weight management, as obesity can exacerbate joint disease and pain. 
"
"The most significant short-term complications are dislocating the hip again; implant issues such as loosening, fracture, or nerve damage; and infections.
"
"You must use caution while your dog is in recovery to ensure your dog is properly restricted and does not slip and fall.  
"
"If your dog seems to be in pain or not able to walk or uncomfortable during recovery, you should have them reexamined by their vet immediately to ensure the hip has not moved out of place.  
"
"You should NOT wait for your dog’s dislocated hip to “heal on its own.” If the dislocation is not corrected, the body will try to stabilize the area with scar tissue. 
"
"However, this type of healing is not very strong and will not give the dog a normal range of motion. The bones might also rub on each other, causing chronic pain.
"
"You must take your dog to the emergency vet to have them put your dog’s hip back in place through closed reduction (manual repositioning) or open reduction (surgery).   
"
"If your dog is not able to walk or bear weight on a leg, and they have a history of trauma (sustained an injury like being hit by a car), it is highly likely that they have a dislocated hip. Other signs can include intense pain, the affected leg appearing shorter than the other legs, swelling of the joint, and decreased appetite or activity.  
"
"Total recovery will likely take two to three months, with additional time for physical therapy. The exact recovery time will depend on the trauma that caused the dislocated hip, as well as the method used to repair it. A recovery plan will be customized by your veterinarian.  
"
"Most dogs will not walk on a leg with a dislocated hip and will instead carry the leg.

"Exophthalmos, enophthalmos, and strabismus are all diseases which cause the dog's eyeball to be abnormally positioned.
"
"With exophthalmos, the dog's eyeball protrudes, or bulges, from the orbit of the eye. This may be due to a space-occupying mass behind the eyeball. Enophthalmos, meanwhile, causes the eyeball to recess, or sink, into the skull. Lastly, strabismus is when an affected animal's eye appears to look off at a different angle, unable to focus in the same direction as the other eye. This can occur with one or both eyes, and is more commonly referred to as ""crossed eyes.""
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"The signs for each of these disease are as follows:
"
"Exophthalmos is generally due to a space-occupying mass located behind the eyeball. Strabismus, or ""crossed eyes,"" is usually caused by an imbalance of extraocular (outside of the eye) muscle tone. The Shar-pei is highly susceptible to this eye disease.
"
"Some other factors that may lead to these eye diseases include:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam, examining the eyeballs, surrounding bone and muscle, and an inspection of your dog's mouth for any abnormalities. X-ray imaging of the skull will help to determine the exact location of any growths, pockets of fluid, or abnormalities in the muscle or bone that might be contributing to the abnormal positioning of the eyeball.
"
"Your veterinarian will also probably want to perform basic blood tests, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel, just to make sure there is no underlying systemic disease involved.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments dependent on your dog’s underlying diagnosis. For example, if your pet has an eye infection, your veterinarian will want to examine your dog at least weekly until signs of the disease have resolved.
"
"If you see signs of any of these eye diseases returning, you will need to contact your veterinarian immediately to avoid permanent damage to the eye.

"Gastrointestinal food reactions involve abnormal clinical symptoms to a particular diet. A dog that is experiencing a food reaction is unable to digest, absorb, and/or utilize a particular foodstuff.
"
"It is important to note that these reactions are not due to food allergies, which involve an immune reaction to a particular component of a diet. However, both food reactions and food allergy share common symptoms, causes, diagnostics, and even treatments, making it a challenge for an attending veterinarian to differentiate between the two.
"
"Reactions to a particular diet are often due to unknown causes, but they may be linked to a particular dietary ingredient, additive, or dietary compound. Also possible is a reaction to the toxic effects of a particular food contaminant (e.g., Salmonella) or to spoiled foodstuff (e.g., mold/fungus).
"
"Dogs of any age, breed, or gender can be affected. Gluten sensitivity has been reported in Irish setters. Lactose intolerance is a common finding in adult dogs.
"
"Symptoms may appear after adding a new foodstuff or source to your dog’s diet. The clinical symptoms may subside in the fasted state (medically supervised) or within days of a new dietary change. Common symptoms of a dietary reaction include:
"
"In most cases of adverse dietary reactions, there is a history of sudden diet change. The dog may also be reacting to food additives, coloring, spices, or propylene glycol, etc. Other underlying factors include an inability to utilize certain component(s) in a food and toxicity due to contaminated and/or spoiled foods.
"
"Your veterinarian will take a detailed and comprehensive history from you, especially regarding the dog's diet. Diagnosis of food reactions can be a daunting task, as there are a number of other health problems that may produce a similar spectrum of symptoms. Moreover, there are other disorders that may occur with dietary intolerances, further complicating the diagnosis.
"
"Laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. However, the results of these tests are often found normal if no other underlying disease is present. Further testing may be required to exclude other diseases that may cause similar symptoms in dogs.
"
"The most widely practiced diagnostic procedure involves dietary manipulation of the affected dog. In this procedure efforts are made to find out the specific culprit in the diet. Home-cooked diets or special diet plans with minimal ingredients or additives are used initially. This can make it easier to determine the problematic dietary component in the individual dog. Typically, within a few days of the new diet clinical symptoms will start improving in these patients. After an improvement in clinical symptoms has been confirmed, your veterinarian will try to find the particular dietary ingredient by using various dietary ingredients.
"
"Your veterinarian may also use endoscopy, a method in which a small camera that is attached to a flexible tube is inserted into the actual space to be examined. In this way the internal structure of the intestines can be closely examined, and will allow your doctor to take a tissue sample from the intestine for laboratory testing. Abdominal X-rays can also be useful in excluding other diseases that may cause similar clinical symptoms.
"
"
"
"Dogs with severe vomiting, diarrhea, or other clinical symptoms may require hospitalization for intravenous fluid administration, antibiotics, and supportive care. In most cases, the dog does not need hospitalization.
"
"The cornerstone of a successful treatment plan is in identifying the offending dietary component and excluding it from the diet. If the problematic dietary component cannot be identified, your veterinarian will suggest and help you plan a nutritionally complete exclusion diet. A trial and error method can be employed if a confirmatory diagnosis cannot be achieved. Your veterinarian will devise a plan to include or exclude a particular dietary component and monitor the response.
"
"The prognosis of most patients is very good, especially if the offending dietary component has been identified. The major goal of therapy is to avoid the causative dietary component.
"
"If your dog has been diagnosed with food sensitivities, you will need to avoid feeding your dog food scraps or adding new foodstuffs without first consulting with your veterinarian. If your veterinarian has prescribed a specific diet, adherence to the prescribed diet is of utmost importance.
"
"Poor treatment response is commonly due to reduced owner compliance, such as when the dog's owner reverts to giving “treats.” Do not allow children or visitors to feed the dog without prior permission. Good owner compliance will ensure long-term improvement of clinical symptoms.

"The diaphragm, a thin muscle, serves as a vital barrier, separating the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity in dogs. Its role in the breathing process is crucial: during inhalation, the diaphragm flattens, generating a vacuum that draws air into the expanding lungs. Upon exhalation, the diaphragm returns to its normal dome shape, facilitating the expulsion of air from the body.
"
"However, if the diaphragm muscle becomes torn, a concerning condition can arise. This tear allows the contents of the abdomen to breach into the thoracic (chest) cavity. In essence, the dog’s stomach, intestine, and other organs can migrate into the chest, where they don’t belong. This condition is known as a diaphragmatic hernia or, alternatively, a herniated diaphragm.
"
"Diaphragmatic hernias in dogs primarily occur due to blunt force trauma, often resulting from incidents like a dog being hit by a car or kicked by a large farm animal. This forceful impact causes a tear in the thin diaphragm muscle. The size of the tear can vary, ranging from very small and easily sealed with abdominal tissue, called mesentery, to significantly large. In some cases, the tear may start as a very small opening and enlarge over time.
"
"This condition is commonly screened for by veterinarians when there is a known history of trauma. It is generally regarded as a medical emergency, except in cases where the tear is very small and the dog remains otherwise stable. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial in managing diaphragmatic hernias to ensure the best possible outcome for the dog.
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Rapid, shallow breaths
"
"Cyanotic (blue) gums
"
"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complex condition. In DIC, clotting in the blood is activated and blood clots can block blood vessels that supply the organs, such as the liver and kidneys, causing decreased blood flow. Organ damage can occur and progress to multiple organ failure, even death.  After all clotting factors are used up, bruising and bleeding from the gums and nose may be seen.
"
"DIC is always triggered by an underlying condition and is very difficult to diagnose. In most cases, dogs will likely be hospitalized for an underlying illness and the veterinarian will suspect that DIC has also developed.
"
"DIC is considered a medical emergency and should be treated immediately, as it can quickly become life-threatening. If your dog is not already at the veterinary hospital, take them immediately if DIC is suspected.  
"
"Clinical signs of DIC vary and may be influenced by the underlying condition causing the DIC. Common signs include:
"
"DIC is always secondary to an underlying disease or condition. In other words, DIC is triggered by another condition. Some of the common conditions known to cause DIC include:
"
"Diagnosing DIC can be challenging, since there is no definitive test. Advanced blood tests to assess clotting factors and clotting times may be useful, but the results can be highly variable based on where the pet is on the spectrum of disease. 
"
"During the clotting phase, results will differ from the results seen when clotting factors are used up.  Serum chemistry will likely be performed to assess organ function and screen for organ failure.  The complete blood count will be monitored to identify anemia from bleeding.
"
"Additional diagnostics will likely be performed to identify the underlying cause that triggered DIC. It may include chest X-rays, abdominal ultrasound, urinalysis, and additional specialized testing.
"
"The underlying condition that triggered the DIC must be identified and treated. Subsequently, treatment for DIC  may include surgery and/or aggressive medical management, including IV fluids, antibiotics, and steroids. 
"
"There is no cure or specific treatment for DIC. Additional treatment for DIC will be general supportive care. In most cases, DIC will be diagnosed on a patient already hospitalized. They will need to continue to be hospitalized for IV fluids (to keep them hydrated) and administered supportive care medications to address any symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or pain. Oxygen therapy may be needed for any dogs having trouble breathing. Plasma and blood transfusions may be needed.
"
"Anorexia (loss of appetite)
"
"Exercise intolerance
"
"Muffled heart sounds
"
"Thinner, empty-looking abdomen
"
"In some cases, there may be no signs at all, making the condition even more challenging to detect without thorough medical evaluation
"
"The most frequent cause of a diaphragmatic hernia in dogs is trauma. Common examples of traumatic incidents include being hit by a car, kicked by a cow or horse, or falling from a high ledge or out of a window. The sheer force from such events can lead to a tear in the thin muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen.
"
"In rare instances, a dog may be born with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, where there is a defect present at birth.
"
"Diaphragmatic hernias are most commonly diagnosed by X-rays after a physical exam. Your veterinarian should be able to visualize the normal diaphragm and confirm that the chest and abdomen appear normal, with everything in its proper place.
"
"Sometimes, the tear in the diaphragm is so small that it can be missed on initial X-rays. If there is a history of trauma, your veterinarian may recommend follow-up X-rays or special imaging to clarify whether a hernia is present.
"
"The ease of diagnosing the hernia depends on the size of the initial tear in the diaphragm. If there are no signs detected during your dog’s initial exam and X-rays but a hernia is present, several months may pass before small amounts of abdominal tissue start to slide and protrude through the hole. This can exert pressure on the tear, enlarging it. Eventually, more abdominal organs, such as the intestines, stomach, and liver, may herniate through the hole and enter the chest.
"
"Your dog may display signs of a hernia much later after the traumatic event, necessitating repeat X-rays to diagnose the diaphragmatic hernia accurately.
"
"Diaphragmatic hernias are typically treated surgically. Depending on the severity of the hernia, your dog may need to be stabilized before undergoing anesthesia for the surgical repair of the torn diaphragm.
"
"In situations where fluid from the abdomen has entered the chest cavity, hindering your dog’s ability to breathe, your veterinarian may recommend a procedure known as thoracocentesis before the surgery. This involves removal of fluid from the chest cavity using a needle, allowing the lungs to expand and enabling the dog to breathe more easily.
"
"Unfortunately, diaphragmatic hernias cannot be treated with medications, and surgery remains the most effective course of action. Before proceeding with surgery, it is crucial that a dog is stable. However, delaying surgery for too long can result in formation of scar tissue between the lungs and abdominal organs, making surgery a risky option.
"
"Early intervention is key to preventing complications and improving the chances of a successful outcome. The veterinary surgeon will carefully assess your dog’s condition and determine the optimal timing for surgery, balancing the need for stabilization with the potential risks of delay. By promptly addressing the diaphragmatic hernia through surgery, they can provide the best possible chance of recovery for your dog.
"
"The prognosis for dogs after surgery to repair a herniated diaphragm is typically guarded for the first 24 hours. Some dogs may experience re-expansion edema, the accumulation of fluid in their lungs after the hernia has been repaired. This condition is usually seen when the lung lobes have collapsed for an extended period while the hernia was present.
"
"However, if your dog is doing well after the initial 24 hours, their prognosis for a full recovery improves significantly.
"
"It is crucial to follow all post-operative instructions during your dog’s recovery from surgery. The recovery period typically lasts for about two weeks and necessitates strict rest and activity restriction.
"
"When taking your dog outside, be sure to leash-walk them only and avoid letting them run, jump, or engage in play during this time. To prevent licking, chewing, or scratching at the incision, your dog should wear an Elizabethan collar or recovery shirt whenever they are not under direct supervision until the sutures or staples are removed.
"
"Administer all prescribed pain medications and antibiotics as directed on their labels. If during the recovery period you notice any signs of concern, such as difficulty breathing, lethargy, vomiting, or decreased appetite, contact your veterinarian promptly.
"
"While a diaphragmatic hernia should be surgically repaired as soon as possible, dogs may be able to live with a hernia for a period of time, depending on its size and severity.
"
"Diaphragmatic hernias are relatively uncommon injuries in dogs. However, dogs who experience blunt force trauma should be screened by a veterinarian for a herniated diaphragm.

"DIC is a severe, life-threatening condition that should be treated immediately because it can have deadly consequences. Early diagnosis and treatment of DIC and the underlying condition are vital for a successful outcome and survival.
"
"Typically, dogs will require 3-5 days in the hospital (sometimes more) for treatment of the underlying condition and aggressive supportive care. Even with intensive care, the prognosis for survival is typically around 40%. Dogs that do survive may have long-term organ damage and require continued veterinary care, bloodwork, and medications.
"
"There are two forms of DIC, acute and chronic. Acute DIC is the most dangerous form and can result in blood clots, organ failure, bleeding, and death. Both forms of DIC are caused by an underlying disease or condition that should be identified and treated as quickly as possible.
"
"Approximately 40% of dogs diagnosed with DIC survive. DIC is a severe, life-threatening condition which should be treated immediately for the best possible outcome.

"The pancreas is an organ located in the abdomen, near the stomach. Under normal circumstances, the pancreas makes insulin, a polypeptide hormone that helps to control blood sugar (glucose) levels in the body. When a dog eats food, its blood sugar rises in accordance with the sugars in the food (whether they are natural sugars or not). The pancreas then makes insulin to lower the blood sugar levels to a healthy level. In this way, the other organs in the body are able to absorb and use this sugar for energy.
"
"In the case of diabetes mellitus, the pancreas is not capable of making enough insulin.  When this happens, the blood sugar level remains too high, a condition defined as  hyperglycemia. A dog's body responds to high blood sugar in several ways. First, extra urine is produced , causing the dog to urinate more frequently than usual. Because it is urinating a lot more, it will drink a lot more water, too. Eventually, your dog will be at risk for becoming dehydrated because of the excess urination.
"
"Because insulin helps the body to use sugar for energy, lack of insulin also means that the body’s organs will not receive enough energy. This will make your dog feel hungry all the time, and though it will be eating a lot more food, it will not gain weight.
"
"If the diabetic condition is not treated early, your dog's blood sugar level will go higher and higher. Because of the excessively elevated glucose level, even more urine will be made and the dog will become dehydrated due to the loss of fluid. This combination of very high blood sugar and dehydration will eventually affect the brain's ability to function normally, leading to depression, seizures and coma. It is rare, however, since symptoms will often warrant a visit to the veterinarian before a pet's health has deteriorated to that level.

"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms that you have provided and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A complete blood count, biochemical profile and urine analysis will be ordered. The veterinarian will use these tests to determine your dog's blood sugar level, water and electrolyte balance, and how well its internal organs are functioning. These tests will also help your veterinarian to determine if there are any other diseases that might be aggravating your dog's diabetes mellitus.
"
"
"
"If your dog has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus but is alert, active, and eating, it will be started on insulin therapy and a special food diet. Some dogs are able to take medications by mouth instead of insulin injections to help control blood sugar.
"
"If your dog has diabetes along with other problems like depression and dehydration, it will be kept in the hospital for several days, where it will be given fluids and insulin until its blood sugar levels have stabilized. It will also be started on a special diet to control blood sugar.
"
"If your dog is diabetic and in a coma, is having seizures, or has almost no energy (is very lethargic), it can be considered to be in a life threatening condition. Your dog will be placed in the intensive care unit of the hospital for several days where your veterinarian can treat it with intravenous (IV) fluids and electrolytes. Your dog's blood sugar and electrolyte level will be determined every few hours until it has stabilized. Your dog will also start receiving insulin to bring down the blood sugar level, and you will be given medications to help control vomiting or other symptoms your dog might have.
"
"While your dog is in the hospital, your veterinarian will be watching for and treating other diseases which can occur while your dog is being stabilized. Some of these are heart failure, kidney failure, bleeding into the intestines, or infections. Getting your dog to the point where it feels better is a slow process, since bringing the blood sugar down too fast could make your dog's health worse. Keep in mind that dog's that have become very ill with diabetes do not do well, especially if they have other diseases concurrent with diabetes.
"
"Once your dog's blood sugar has been brought down and it is able to eat and drink on its own, it will be able to go home with you. Most dogs that have been very sick with diabetes will need insulin. While some dogs are able to take oral medications to help control blood sugar, only your veterinarian can determine whether your dog is a good candidate for oral medications. Your veterinarian will teach you how and when to give insulin injections to your dog, and will also help you to formulate a diet to control its blood sugar levels. It is  important to follow all of your veterinarian’s instructions for meals, and for scheduled insulin or medication. Do not change the amount of insulin you give or how often you give it without first consulting with your veterinarian first.
"
"Initially, your dog will need to return for follow-up visits frequently, and there may be times when it will need to remain in the hospital for some of these visits so its blood sugar level can be checked every two hours. Occasionally, some diabetic dogs can become non-diabetics again, but more often affected dogs will need insulin and special food for the rest of their lives. Your veterinarian will discuss with you how to tell if your dog is becoming a non-diabetic again.
"
"To prevent your dog from developing dehydration, seizures or coma because of diabetes, you will need to stick to a regular health and diet schedule, returning to your veterinarian for all follow-up visits. This will ensure that your dog is receiving the correct dosage of insulin.
"
"It will be important to monitor your dog for any changes in its appetite or behavior, including its energy levels. One of the health issues that arises with this condition is a higher frequency of infections, and you will need to have your dog treated quickly before it gets out of hand if this should occur. Consult with your veterinarian as soon as you notice any changes in health or behavior.

"Diabetes insipidus is a rare condition in dogs. The condition is caused by the inability to make or react to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) which forces excessive urination and subsequent thirst. This hormone, produced in the hypothalamus area of the brain, and stored in the pituitary gland, helps regulate water conservation. If ADH is not readily available or if the kidneys are not functional, water is lost through the urine. This leads to large urine volume and secondary increased thirst.
"
"Diabetes insipidus is not the same as the common condition, diabetes mellitus in dogs. Both diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus share the symptoms of excessive thirst and urinating. But the conditions are treated very differently.
"
"There are two forms of diabetes insipidus in dogs:
"
"Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) in dogs occurs when the hypothalamus does not produce any or enough ADH.
"
"Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI) in dogs occurs when the kidneys do not respond appropriately to ADH.
"
"Both conditions are extremely rare. The hallmark signs of diabetes insipidus are polyuria (increased urination) and polydipsia (increased thirst). Since there are dozens of more common diseases that can cause the same clinical signs, your veterinarian will want to rule out these disorders first. 
"
"Fortunately, some forms of diabetes insipidus are treatable, meaning dogs diagnosed with the condition will lead normal lives.
"
"The most typical symptoms of diabetes insipidus in dogs include: 
"
"Excessive thirst and urination
"
"Incontinence due to increased and frequent urination
"
"Dehydration
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Weight loss
"
"Lethargy
"
"Possible neurological abnormalities (seizures, disorientation, and incoordination)
"
"Diabetes insipidus in dogs can be caused two ways:
"
"Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI): occurs when the hypothalamus within the brain, does not produce enough ADH, or the pituitary gland is unable to store it properly. This is more commonly seen in senior or middle-aged dogs.
"
"Causes of CDI in dogs include:
"
"Congenital defect (born with condition, and is rare)
"
"Head trauma (car accident, falling injury, bite wound, oxygen deprivation, etc.)
"
"Cancer that affects this specific part of the brain
"
"Idiopathic (unknown cause)
"
"Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI): occurs in dogs when the kidneys cannot react to the ADH that is produced from the brain. There are primary and secondary forms of NDI.
"
"Primary NDI is when a dog is born with a deficiency in ADH receptors in the kidney. Veterinarians usually diagnose primary NDI in dogs under one year of age. Primary NDI seems to occur in German Shepherds, Miniature Poodles and Siberian Huskies, although it is unknown if there is a genetic cause.
"
"Secondary or acquired NDI has many causes including:
"
"Certain medications
"
"Diseases such as Addison’s disease, Cushing’s disease or pyometra
"
"Kidney damage (infection, inflammation, urethral blockage or chronic kidney disease)
"
"Liver disease
"
"High calcium
"
"Electrolyte abnormalities
"
"Leptospirosis infection
"
"Idiopathic (unknown)
"
"A veterinarian will conduct the same lab work and testing to determine the cause of symptoms for excessive thirst and urination in dogs. This may include the following:
"
"Complete blood count
"
"Urinalysis, with culture
"
"Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test for Addison’s disease
"
"Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test primarily tests for Cushing’s disease
"
"Serum bile acids analyze liver function
"
"Thyroid function tests to determine hypothyroid disease or an underactive thyroid
"
"These tests will help rule out more common conditions that lead to polydipsia and polyuria including kidney disease or Cushing’s disease.
"
"An outdated test, called a water deprivation test, was previously used by veterinarians to diagnose the condition. Dogs given this test would become critically ill, especially those with other serious conditions, and because of this reaction the test has been removed from most offices.
"
"Treatment for diabetes insipidus in dogs will depend on what is determined during diagnosis, and if the dog has CDI or NDI.
"
"Dogs diagnosed with CDI may continue to take Desmopressin to help reduce symptoms. This medication is available in both nasal and oral forms. Pet parents should monitor dogs treated with Desmopressin for signs of overhydration which includes vomiting and diarrhea, difficulty breathing or changes in mentation.
"
"CDI in dogs is rarely cured but can be managed. Veterinarians may treat dogs with Desmopressin and other supportive therapy options.
"
"NDI can be cured if vets can identify and treat the primary underlying disease. However, there is no specific therapy to cure NDI on its own.
"
"More commonly, a trial with the drug Desmopressin is used as a safer alternative. Desmopressin serves as a synthetic version of ADH and can act as a replacement to the hormone. Veterinarians will likely only attempt this trial test if they have ruled out all other possible conditions for excessive urination and thirst in dogs.
"
"Once the drug is given, a pet parent will be asked to measure urination output and water consumption for a set number of days and submit urine for testing to the veterinarian before and after.
"
"A significant decrease in water intake and an increase in urine concentration of more than 50 percent are consistent with a diagnosis of CDI. A dog with the NDI form of this condition will not show signs of improvement.
"
"Up to 40 percent of dogs with CDI have a pituitary tumor, so these tests are valuable in cases of CDI. A vet may recommend advanced imaging including MRI and CT scans, which are used to help the vet evaluate the brain for cancer, lesions or trauma.
"
"The prognosis for both CDI and NDI forms is typically good, depending on the underlying disorder.
"
"NDI can be cured with treating the underlying disease or disorder, while CDI is usually not curable. The only types of CDI that can be cured are those that are transient or trauma-related and allow the brain’s anatomy to return to normal. NDI may be controlled by treating the underlying disease, however, if that disease is chronic, it may also lead to relapses of NDI. Dogs can live near-normal lives with some forms of diabetes insipidus — if the side effects of thirst and urination are not intolerable to pet parents.
"
"Dogs with diabetes insipidus, especially those who are untreated, must always have access to water. If not, severe dehydration, stupor, coma and death can occur.
"
"Follow-up lab work will likely be recommended for any pet on Desmopressin, or additional medications, to ensure kidney function and other organs are working properly. 
"
"Dogs most commonly display excessive thirst and urination with diabetes insipidus.
"
"Both forms of diabetes insipidus are extremely rare.
"
"Diabetes mellitus is a disorder of blood sugar regulation, while diabetes insipidus is a disorder of water metabolism.
"
"Dogs with diabetes insipidus may live a near-normal life based on the underlying cause.
"
"Some, but not all forms of diabetes insipidus can be cured.

"Several hormones are produced by the pituitary gland, any one or more of which may be lacking. The resultant condition, hypopituitarism, is associated with low production of hormones that are produced by the pituitary gland, a small endocrine gland located near the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. Of these hormones, some of the more clinically significant ones are the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); the adrenocorticotropin hormone (produced by the anterior pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal cortex); the luteinizing hormone (stimulates secretion of sex steroids); the follicle stimulating hormone (secreted by the gonadotropes in the anterior pituitary gland); and the growth hormone (GH). Hypopituitarism can also result from the destruction of the pituitary gland by a cancerous, degenerative, or anomalous process.
"
"This disorder is known to occur on average in dogs around the ages of two to six months. There appears to be some breed disposition, appearing more frequently in German shepherds, Carnelian bear dogs, spitzes, toy pinschers, and weimaraners. In German shepherds and Carnelian bear dogs the cause has been linked to a simple autosomal recessive genetic trait.
"
"The symptoms of hypopituitarism can vary depending on which hormones are  lacking, and which body function is being affected by the deficit. For  example, lack of luteinizing hormones can result in sexual  abnormalities such as abnormally small genitals, and GH deficiency can result in lack of appropriate  growth or dwarfism. If the gland is being affected by cancer or tumor, the affected  dog may be experiencing pain in its head (with consequential  head-pressing), or visual problems. Other symptoms include:
"
"  
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, growth, behavioral development, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as trauma to the head. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Blood tests are the most reliable method for diagnosis of this condition.
"
"Standard blood test results may show increased levels of eosinophilia (white blood cells), lymphocytosis (disease of the lymph glands), hypophosphatemia (phosphorus deficiency), or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Other laboratory tests will test the levels of hormones in the bloodstream. Your veterinarian will want to have your dog brought in for a morning blood draw in order to measure basal levels of TSH and prolactin. Another blood test, called a dynamic test, measures hormone levels after injection of a hormone stimulating substance. This can be used to check levels of ACTH and GH. The results of these tests generally are the best indicators for hypopituitarism. Visual imaging techniques, primarily using X-ray, can be used to check for the presence of a tumor or cyst in the vicinity of the pituitary gland.
"
"
"
"Management of hypopituitarism is usually conducted on an outpatient basis. Growth hormone supplements will be administered to your dog three times weekly for 4–6 weeks, and repeated if necessary. Tumors of the pituitary gland can be surgically removed in some cases, but the prognosis is generally not favorable.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up visits in order to monitor your dog's blood and urinary glucose concentration. Growth hormone supplementation will be suspended if glucosuria (an abnormal condition of osmotic diuresis due to excretion of glucose by the kidneys) develops, or if the blood glucose is more than 150 mg/dL.
"
"Your dog's skin and haircoat should improve within 6–8 weeks of initiating growth hormone and thyroid supplementation. Generally, in the case of low GH levels, there is no increase in stature because the growth plates have usually closed by the time a diagnosis has been made. Unfortunately, because many of the hormones that are affected by pituitary disorders are essential for the overall health, the long term prognosis for hypopituitarism is poor.

"Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood-glucose (sugar) level in a dog’s body becomes dangerously high, either from lack of insulin production in the body or from the body’s inability to respond to the insulin produced. 
"
"Ketoacidosis is considered the most serious complication that can occur in a dog with diabetes mellitus. The average age of dogs with ketoacidosis is around 8 years, but it has been reported in dogs as young as 8 months, and as old as 16 years. There is no specific breed or sex predisposition in dogs, although diabetes mellitus is diagnosed more commonly in middle-aged to older female dogs.
"
"Diabetes mellitus is a medical condition in which the lack of insulin in the body (or the body’s lack of response to its insulin) causes a large amount of glucose to build up in the bloodstream. Insulin acts as a gatekeeper between the body’s cells and the bloodstream. The cells need glucose for energy and to function appropriately, and insulin ensures that the amount remains under control.
"
"In diabetic pets, shortage of insulin means that glucose cannot move into their cells, so the glucose level in the bloodstream increases and continues to circulate. As a result, the cells can’t perform their normal duties because they are starved for sugar which leads to diabetes mellitus.
"
"Eventually, the body begins to break down fat stores to access the carbohydrates needed to feed the cells. This process produces ketone bodies, which then begin to circulate through the bloodstream as well. Ketone bodies are considered an alternate source of fuel for the cells in times of low-blood glucose. In small amounts, they are safe for the body, but when larger amounts of ketones are used up, the blood becomes more acidic, causing a major electrolyte disturbance.
"
"Severe dehydration ensues and worsens the body’s electrolyte abnormalities. Eventually, this leads to secondary issues of ketoacidosis, such as poor muscle function, swelling of the cells in the brain, heart failure, kidney and liver malfunction, and heart arrhythmias. Without speedy, aggressive, and appropriate medical therapy, diabetic ketoacidosis is fatal.

"Examples of stressors on the body include any inflammation, infection or surgery. Certain concurrent diseases can lead to ketoacidosis, including pancreatitis, urinary tract infections, kidney infections, hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing’s disease), cancers, and heart disease. 
"
"Diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis includes a complete history, a physical examination and diagnostic testing conducted in a hospital. This includes:  
"
"Not all dogs with high blood glucose and ketones in the bloodstream and/or urine require hospitalization. Sometimes, in the early stages, insulin therapy can be initiated at home under the direction of a veterinarian to help correct these mild changes. 
"
"Symptoms of dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, vomiting, weakness, very high blood glucose, and large amounts of ketones circulating through the body require more aggressive therapy. 
"
"Aggressive therapy includes a several-day stay in the hospital to correct dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities with appropriate fluid therapy and intravenous electrolyte supplementation. Electrolytes (most commonly potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium) are monitored frequently with blood work, as electrolytes can change very rapidly during treatment. 
"
"Insulin therapy is instituted either through several intramuscular injections (over 24 hours) or a continuous infusion drip. This insulin drives the blood glucose into the cells for nourishment and decreases the body’s need to break down its fat stores for ketones.
"
"Acid/base status is monitored closely during a hospitalization and if the acidic state of the blood is not corrected with fluid therapy, then sodium bicarbonate therapy is instituted. This helps bring the acidic state of the bloodstream to a more normal range. 
"
"Often, anti-emetic medications, anti-acid medications, pain medications, antibiotics, and appetite stimulants are considered during hospitalization, depending on clinical signs and concurrent medical issues.
"
"It is important to note that ketoacidosis is a life-threatening condition requiring several days of hospitalization, aggressive fluid, and electrolyte and insulin therapy, a lifelong treatment with insulin, and frequent veterinary visits after discharge. In a study of 127 dogs treated for ketoacidosis, 70 percent survived and were discharged from the hospital with an average hospital stay of six days. 
"
"The most important steps in the prevention of ketoacidosis are appropriate insulin dosing and administration. Insulin therapy will be determined by your veterinarian, and dosing will be demonstrated to you prior to your dog’s discharge from the hospital. 
"
"Monitoring blood glucose and ketones at home is considered a mainstay of treatment for the prevention of ketoacidosis. Your veterinarian will instruct you how on how to perform this monitoring at home.
"
"It is important to follow the veterinarian’s instructions for insulin dosing, especially how to handle the insulin, the size/gauge insulin needle required and the timing of insulin administration to avoid recurrent ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia (a state where the blood glucose drops too low). 
"
"Yes, a dog can recover from diabetic ketoacidosis - if diagnosed early and treated aggressively.
"
"Yes, diabetic ketoacidosis is a treatable condition in dogs, though the treatment can be lengthy and expensive.
"
"Warning signs of diabetic ketoacidosis in dogs include lethargy, depression, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst and urination, and flaky unkempt haircoat, especially when there has been a previous diabetes mellitus diagnosis.

"Superficial necrolytic dermatitis is characterized by the deterioration and death of skin cells. High levels of the hormone glucagon in the blood -- which stimulates production of blood sugar in response to low blood sugar levels -- and deficiencies in amino acids, zinc, and essential fatty acid are believed to play a role in superficial necrolytic dermatitis, either directly or indirectly.
"
"Superficial necrolytic dermatitis is uncommon in dogs and rare in cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"This skin disorder will generally affect the dog's muzzle, paws, footpads, eyes, and genitalia, causing:
"
"Superficial necrolytic dermatitis has been associated with a nutritional imbalance due to a lack of amino acids or a deficiency in the dog's essential fatty acids and zinc; or metabolic abnormalities caused by high serum glucagon levels, liver dysfunction, or a combination of these conditions.
"
"The skin condition is rarely associated with a glucagon-secreting pancreatic tumor, or long-term phenobarbital and phenytoin medication, which is used to treat seizures.
"
"Additionally, superficial necrolytic dermatitis is generally an outward symptom of advanced hepatic disease, or of coincident hepatic disease and diabetes mellitus.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health, onset of symptoms, and possible health conditions that might have precipitated this condition.
"
"Some blood tests may return with abnormal results, such as high bile acids in the blood, high plasma glucagon levels, low amino acids, and high insulin levels. Sulfobromophthalein sodium (BSP, excreted in the bile) levels may also increase to abnormal levels in the blood.
"
"X-ray and ultrasound imaging usually are not helpful in diagnosing glucagon. However, an ultrasound may reveal advanced liver disease. Skin biopsies (tissue samples) are crucial for making a correct diagnosis, but only early lesions are useful for examination.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will treat the underlying disease process if possible, and will prescribe the appropriate medicine to treat the dog's symptoms. Most dogs can be treated on an outpatient basis, but in some cases, hospitalized care will be necessary. Outright liver failure should be treated with supportive care.
"
"Dogs with glucagon-secreting tumors can be cured with surgery, but the tumors will typically spread quickly, before surgical intervention can reverse their progress. Most of these cases are associated with chronic, irreversible liver disease.
"
"Unfortunately, most dogswith this disease will also have a severe internal disease with a poor prognosis. A specially-formulated prescription shampoo can help to remove the crusts and may make your dog feel more comfortable.

"Demodectic mange, also known as red mange, is a parasitic skin infection caused by mites such as Demodex canis (most common), Demodex injai, or Demodex cornei. Under the microscope, it appears cigar-shaped with eight short legs.  
"
"This type of mite is a normal inhabitant of the hair follicle, though it is usually not harmful. If the immune system is healthy, these mites cause no harm to their host. Dogs with immature or compromised immune systems that allow this mite to overgrow will develop clinical signs such as hair loss and red, scaling skin lesions. 
"
"The mite normally lives in low numbers in the hair follicles of the skin. Demodex is most often transmitted from mother to puppy while suckling milk because of the pup’s immature immune system.  Exposure of a normal, healthy dog to one with demodex is not dangerous. Demodectic mange is not contagious between other dogs as it requires a depressed immune system to develop.  
"
"Demodectic mange cannot spread from dogs to humans.   
"
"Clinical signs of demodectic mange include: 
"
"Alopecia (hair loss) 
"
"Skin scaling 
"
"Bumps on the skin (papules) 
"
"Pigmentation of the skin 
"
"Thickening of the skin 
"
" Itchiness varies depending on secondary skin infections or if the lesions are localized to a certain area or are generalized over the body.   
"
"In puppies, lesions often begin around the face and head due to feeding from the mother’s teat, but lesions can be found anywhere on the body. In more severe cases of generalized demodectic mange, pain, lethargy, fever, draining wounds, and skin swelling may be noted. Ear infections are also possible if the mite invades the ear canals.
"
"Demodectic mites typically live on the skin and benefit from their host while causing no actual harm to their host. Mange occurs, when the mite overgrows at the hair follicle, often in those with weaker immune systems such as puppies, whose immune systems are still forming, and older dogs with underlying illnesses leading to depressed immune systems. 
"
"Demodex lives on all our skin, even in normal healthy dogs and humans. When the immune system is depressed, it overgrows causing itching and mange. Normally this mite is only passed between dogs as puppies and is most often passed from mother to puppy.  
"
"Mange is most commonly diagnosed through skin scraping or hair plucking, and cytology. This is a non-invasive test that involves using a scalpel blade and scraping the skin deep enough for mild irritation or bleeding to be noted (this is necessary since demodex lives deep in the hair follicle) or simply removing hair at the root for assessment. The sample is assessed under the microscope. The presence of any mites is considered a positive result.   
"
"Some mites can be found through fecal flotation or fecal testing because the dog ingests them while licking/chewing the skin. 
"
"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can also be performed, but it can warrant false negative results and is often not necessary when diagnosis is evident. 
"
"Finally, skin biopsy may be necessary in cases where the dog is not responding to therapy or if a diagnosis undetermined with other less invasive diagnostic tests. Biopsy is sometimes considered in more severe, generalized cases of demodex.  
"
"Not all cases of demodectic mange require treatment. Most cases of demodectic mange that are localized to a small region of the body will spontaneously resolve in 1-2 months with no treatment. Other cases of localized infections can be treated with topical medication such as moxidectin and imidacloprid.    
"
"If demodectic mange becomes generalized, medication is recommended for resolution of symptoms.  Miticidal treatment (oral or topical) is the most common type of therapy, including ivermectin, milbemycin, doramectin, amitraz, fluralaner (Bravecto), afoxolaner (Nexgard), sarolaner (Simparica), and lotilaner (Credelio). Dogs with MDR1 mutations should never receive ivermectin. This mutation can be determined through genetic testing. 
"
"Miticidal therapy is continued until two consecutive negative skin scraping or hair plucking tests occur.  Special shampoos containing benzoyl peroxide are often recommended as these open and flush the hair follicles to allow dip and topical treatments to penetrate more efficiently. You should discuss the risks and benefits of these medications with your veterinarian before beginning to use them. 
"
"Secondary skin infections due to inflammation can occur and require antibiotic therapy. It may be necessary to treat the skin infection before clearing the demodectic mange. 
"
"It is also recommended to stop breeding dogs with generalized demodex infections as the disease is thought to have an underlying genetic and/or immune system cause that contributes to the overgrowth of mites. 
"
"Most dogs with mange recover well with appropriate therapy in a timely manner. Secondary infections and underlying systemic illness are often the culprits in dogs that require chronic treatment.  
"
"Mange can be fatal in dogs who receive inappropriate therapy or whose underlying medical conditions are not well managed.   
"
"Demodectic mange does not require environmental cleaning as it does not typically transmit between dogs, though a monthly or tri-monthly miticidal preventative is still recommended. Dogs should remain on regular miticidal preventatives to avoid infection from other types of mites, fleas, and ticks unless otherwise directed by your veterinarian.
"
"Demodectic mange is not contagious to humans.
"
"It can take weeks to months for demodectic mange to resolve depending on whether it is a localized or generalized infection and whether there are any secondary infections or underlying illnesses. Every dog will react differently to medications, so there is no exact timeline for resolution.
"
"Demodectic mange can resolve on its own in mild cases. It usually takes 1-2 months for mild, localized infections to resolve spontaneously.
"
"Dogs with demodectic mange are not contagious to other dogs, pets, or humans.

"Diabetes is a common disorder characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (blood sugar) that affects how the body turns food into energy. 
"
"Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates the amount of blood sugar in the blood. Lack of insulin production causes diabetes and prevents blood sugar from getting into the cells of the body and becoming energy. Over time, elevated blood sugar levels can cause serious health problems.
"
"Undiagnosed or diagnosed diabetes in dogs can turn into a medical emergency called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
"
"If your pet is vomiting, having diarrhea, decreased appetite, or lethargic, call your vet to discuss if your pup needs to be seen immediately.
"
"There are primarily two types of diabetes in dogs:
"
"Type I—Known as insulin-dependent diabetes and is like Type I diabetes in humans. This is the most common type to occur in dogs.
"
"In Type I diabetes, insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas are destroyed, causing an absolute lack of insulin. This damage to the pancreatic cells can occur due to autoimmune attacks to the pancreas or severe recurrent pancreatitis. These dogs will require lifetime insulin supplementation therapy. 
"
"Type II—Known as noninsulin-dependent diabetes and is like Type II diabetes in humans. This form of diabetes is typically related to obesity but is very rare in dogs.
"
"In Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce less insulin, and the body’s cells respond poorly to the insulin that is secreted. This leads to less glucose entering the cells (and higher glucose in the blood).
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Symptoms of diabetes in dogs include:
"
"Increased thirst
"
"Increased urination
"
"Increased appetite
"
"Weight loss
"
"Lethargy
"
"Dehydration
"
"Cataracts
"
"Long-term effects of diabetes in dogs, if unregulated or untreated, are severe and eventually fatal. Some common secondary and long-term effects include the following:
"
"Seizures—Low blood sugar can lead to hypoglycemic seizures.
"
"Liver disease—Fatty liver can occur secondary to diabetes resulting in elevated liver values.
"
"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)—DKA is a life-threatening complication of diabetes. It occurs when a diabetic dog develops a secondary medical condition that places additional stress on the body (e.g. pancreatitis or urinary tract infection). This causes the body to break down fat for energy and create ketones which acidify the blood.
"
"Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS)—HHS is a life-threatening complication of diabetes that occurs when the blood sugar is too high for too long, leading to severe dehydration and disorientation.
"
"Diabetic neuropathy—Neurologic damage that can lead to paralysis in rare cases.  
"
"Diabetes in dogs can have several causes. Most dogs acquire Type I, or insulin-dependent diabetes. Type I diabetes is most likely due to the immune system mistakenly attacking insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to a total—or partial—loss of insulin secretion.
"
"Other risks and complicating factors of diabetes include:
"
"Genetics
"
"Increased hormone levels (progesterone, growth hormone and cortisol)
"
"Cushing’s disease
"
"Chronic pancreatitis
"
"Obesity and high-fat diets
"
"Females and middle-aged to senior dogs have a higher risk of diabetes, as well as dogs that are obese. Dog breeds that are predisposed to diabetes include:
"
"Alaskan Malamute
"
"Australian Terrier
"
"Bichon Frise
"
"Cairn Terrier
"
"Keeshond
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"Miniature Schnauzer
"
"Miniature Dachshund
"
"Norwegian Elkhound
"
"Poodle
"
"Pug
"
"Samoyed
"
"Tibetan Terrier
"
"Yorkshire Terrier
"
"Veterinarians may suspect diabetes in dogs based on physical exam findings and symptoms shown at home. However, to officially diagnose diabetes, veterinarians must find persistent high blood and urine glucose values.
"
"Your pup may also have the following tests:
"
"Blood chemistry and complete blood count (CBC)
"
"Urinalysis
"
"Fructosamine
"
"Radiography
"
"Thyroid tests
"
"Cushing’s testing
"
"Abdominal ultrasonography
"
"Pancreatitis blood testing
"
"For uncomplicated cases, treating diabetes in dogs primarily includes insulin and diet changes.
"
"Insulin is the main treatment in dogs with diabetes. While the cost of insulin may only be $40 to $150 per month, the cost to care for a diabetic patient considering all blood work and therapies may be upwards of $2,500 per year. Pet insurance may be a good way to help offset these costs. 
"
"All insulin is absorbed subcutaneously, which requires an injection under the skin. Most dogs require insulin injections twice daily. The amount of insulin is typically not large, and the needles are tiny. Most dogs tolerate insulin injections very well. However, the injection must not be given in the same location every day or scar tissue may form. If this occurs, the insulin won’t be absorbed properly.
"
"Diet therapy is important when treating diabetes in dogs. Pet parents should feed their dogs the same thing, around the same time every day. Consistency is key and leads to better and faster regulation of blood sugar in dogs.
"
"Prescription diets are available for diabetic dogs. These diets typically contain high fiber with appropriate fat, protein, and carbohydrate ratios which help maintain blood-sugar levels.
"
"Speak with your vet about what diet is best for your pup and their individual needs.
"
"Dogs with diabetes require lifelong monitoring and treatment. Insulin and diet control are typically needed for life.
"
"Initially after diagnosis, your dog may need frequent vet visits to help your vet determine the best insulin dose for treatment to control your pet’s blood sugar. 
"
"After that, if your pet is well regulated, vet visits may be every three to six months and will likely include some blood tests to ensure their diabetes is well controlled.
"
"There are four main ways to monitor a dog’s response to insulin treatment:
"
"Blood glucose curve is usually the most accurate way to monitor your dog’s blood sugar. Your dog will stay at the veterinary hospital all day, having blood drawn every one to two hours. These values are plotted on a chart, which typically looks like a curve. Based on the shape of the curve, the highest blood glucose and the lowest blood glucose, your veterinarian will determine if a change in dosage is necessary.
"
"Freestyle Libre involves the painless placement of a small sensor on your dog’s skin to measure blood glucose. Glucose can be checked frequently—without drawing blood—on a device reader or smartphone app. This is especially useful for dogs who tend to be anxious or uncooperative.
"
"Fructosamine can be used to provide a general idea of how well glucose is being regulated over the previous two to three weeks. This may be used as a chronic monitoring tool. 
"
"Urine glucose and ketone measurements are an easy and inexpensive way to monitor dogs at home. This test comes as a small strip that is placed in the stream of urine. The results can be used to help your veterinarian determine if your pet is well regulated.
"
"Management goals for pups include reducing symptoms, maintaining a healthy blood-glucose level, and improving quality of life.
"
"Therapeutic goals for diabetes in dogs are different from those in humans. Veterinarians do not control animals’ glucose as tightly as humans. This means that goal blood glucose readings for dogs may be much higher than expected if a pet parent is familiar with diabetic regulation in humans.
"
"The prognosis for diabetic dogs is based on multiple factors. Uncomplicated diabetics is typically regulated easier and requires only a few visits to the vet per year for monitoring.
"
"Complicated cases of diabetes can be difficult and frustrating for pet parents and veterinarians to manage. If your vet is concerned your pet has complicating factors, they may enlist the help of a veterinary specialist called an internal medicine specialist.
"
"Never adjust your pet’s insulin without the direction and supervision of your veterinarian. 
"
"If your dog is not eating or they’re vomiting, call your vet to determine if you should give their insulin. If they are experiencing any signs of low blood sugar, such as weakness, “star-gazing”, or tremors/seizures, they should be seen by their vet or an emergency vet immediately.
"
"If your dog is showing a breakthrough of clinical signs such as increased drinking, tell your vet. They may want to check their blood work to determine if your dog’s diabetes is well controlled.
"
"While diabetes in dogs is not preventable, there are some things pet parents can do to help.
"
"All dogs should be seen their vet every year for a wellness exam and blood work.
"
"Senior dogs, typically over the age of 6, should be taken to the vet every six months. This exam and blood work can detect changes well before they show up as clinical signs. Therefore, dogs can receive treatment or have lifestyle changes before they are sick, leading to a better quality of life and a longer lifespan.
"
"Pet parents should also provide a high-quality diet and regular exercise to stay lean and active.
"
"Dogs with diabetes can do well and continue to live relatively normal lives with the addition of insulin therapy and diet changes.
"
"No. Diabetes in dogs is caused by a lack of insulin. Treatment must include insulin therapy to allow a dog to use glucose for energy. Insulin is a lifelong part of treatment in a diabetic dog.

"The cornea is the transparent lining that covers the external front of the eyeball; that is, the iris and the pupil (respectively, the colored area that expands and contracts to allow light in, and the lens that transmits the light and image to the brain – the black center). The cornea is continuous with the white part of the eye, the sclera, which covers the rest of the eyeball. Beneath the cornea and the sclera is a layer of connective tissue that supports the eyeball from inside, called the stroma.
"
"Corneal degeneration is a one-sided or two-sided condition, secondary to other eye (ocular) or body (systemic) disorders. It is characterized by lipid (fat-soluble molecules) or calcium deposits within the corneal stroma, and/or epithelium (tissue composed of layers of cells that line the inner hollow of the eyeball, beneath the stroma).
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"The cornea appears rough, with distinct margins where the edge of the cornea meets with the sclera. Associated ocular conditions, such as corneal scars, inflammation of the cornea, or chronic uveitis (long-standing inflammatory disease of the front of the eye), can lead to degeneration of the cornea. If one or more of these conditions have been present, having the cornea checked for further damage would be wise for the prevention of severe and permanent damage.
"
"One of the main causes of corneal degeneration is lipid (fat) deposits in the supporting structure of the inner eyeball: the stroma and the epithelium. While lipids are a normal part of the body, being, as they are, a principal structure of living cells, hyper deposits of lipids in the tissues can bring about disorders to the system they are inhabiting. Systemic hyperlipoproteinemia, a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated concentrations of cholesterol and specific lipoprotein particles in the blood plasma, may increase the risk of deposits in the stroma, or may worsen already existing deposits. Hyperlipoproteinemia can be secondary to hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism (chronic production of too much cortisone), pancreatitis, nephrotic syndrome (a disorder in which the kidneys are damaged), and liver disease.
"
"Hypercalcemia, a condition that is characterized by the production of too much calcium, can increase the risk of deposits of calcium in the stroma, which can also lead to corneal degeneration. Calcium deposits in the stroma are seen less frequently than lipid deposits.
"
"Other disorders that can affect the cornea and its functionality are hypophosphatemia, an electrolyte irregularity distinguished by too little phosphorus in the blood, and hypervitaminosis D, the production of excess vitamin D.
"
"Corneal degeneration is non-inherited, but it does have a higher rate of incidence with miniature schnauzers.
"
"Your veterinarian will look for several indications before settling on a diagnosis. Yourdog 's eyes will be coated with fluorescein stain, an orange dye that is viewed in blue light to detect damage to the cornea, or to the presence of foreign objects on the surface of the eye. The stain examination may show a corneal ulcer with varying degrees of edema (swelling). The edema, if present, will appear bluish to gray and can vary in size depending on severity, with indistinct margins. The stain would also show the presence of a corneal scar – which would cause some opacity, appearing gray to white depending on severity. Corneal ulceration may be associated with worsening of the disease, and vision may be affected if the disease is in an advanced state. Severe vision impairment may occur if a primary eye disease, such as uveitis, is found to be present.
"
"If the fluorescein stain does not show any abnormalities, the veterinarian will look for corneal stromal weakness (dystrophy), which affects both eyes, often affecting proportional focus. The cornea will be gray to white in appearance, with distinct margins. This disorder does not retain fluorescein stain and is not associated with inflammation of the eye. If an object has entered the eye (inflammatory cell infiltrate) it will cause the cornea to appear gray to white, with indistinct margins; microscopic examination of the corneal cells will reveal white blood cells, the cells that are responsible for defending the body against foreign materials and infection, indicating that organisms are present in the eye.
"
"The following may contain Chewy links. PetMD is operated by Chewy.
"
"Degenerative Myelopathy (DM) is a slow onset, non-painful destruction of the nerve conduction portion of the spinal cord, called axons and myelin. Axons are the nerve fibers that extend from the nerve cell and myelin is the coating around the nerve fiber that allows for conduction of nerve signals. Both the thoracic (upper and middle back) and lumbar (lower back) parts of the spinal cord are affected. 
"
"As the disease progresses, a dog will develop weakness and an abnormal gait in the hind limbs. Usually, the condition is worse on one side of the spinal cord than the other, so clinical signs may be worse on one side of the body compared to the other side. With time, the disease causes paralysis of the hind limbs. The entire spinal cord can eventually become affected—causing forelimb paralysis and problems with breathing, vocalizing, and eating.
"
"Typically, about one year after the first symptoms are seen, a dog is unable to walk on their hind limbs.
"
"The German Shepherd is the most common breed affected by DM, but it can also be seen in other large breed dogs, such as:
"
"Labrador Retrievers
"
"Boxers
"
"Bernese Mountain Dogs
"
"Chesapeake Bay Retrievers
"
"Rhodesian Ridgebacks
"
"Siberian Huskies
"
"
"
"If a disease of the eye is present, your veterinarian will treat the condition accordingly. Lipid and calcium deposits that impair vision or create discomfort to the eye, either from a roughened surface, or from disruption and ulceration of the corneal epithelium, may benefit from a vigorous corneal scraping, or a superficial removal of part of the cornea (keratectomy). These procedures would be followed by medical management, since deposits are likely to recur in patients following superficial keratectomy surgery. Your dog's diet will also be a consideration. If hyperlipoproteinemia is diagnosed, a low-fat diet would be beneficial for hindering further progression. Your veterinarian will advise you on this. Both methods of treatment can be useful for slowing or stopping progression of the disease.
"
"Your doctor will want to monitor your dog's serum cholesterol and triglycerides to assess the effectiveness of dietary management, if that has been recommended as a maintenance strategy. If a primary disease if present, its will be monitored for progression or regression, and treated according to the indications and comfort needs of your dog.

"Degenerative myelopathy can also be seen in some smaller breeds, such as the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Pug, and Miniature Poodle. Affected dogs are most commonly middle-aged or older.
"
"A dog with DM will initially become weak in the hind limbs and have a hard time getting up. They will lose feeling in the hind limbs, which results in dragging of the paws, scuffing of the toenails and/or tops of the paws, and abnormal paw placement. Affected dogs will be wobbly and may knuckle over the paws, cross the hind limbs, or stumble while walking. 
"
"With progression of the condition, a severely affected dog will lose the ability to stand on or move the hind limbs. If able to stand on the hind limbs, a patient’s legs may shake due to weakness. In the later stage of the disease, a patient may have problems with fecal and urinary incontinence. Muscle wasting will be noted in the hind limbs, due to the dog not using them.
"
"Eventually, the disease will progress to involve the forelimbs and brainstem—rendering a dog fully paralyzed and developing problems with breathing and eating/drinking. 
"
"A genetic component to the disease has been identified. Dogs that have two copies of a mutated superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1) gene are at increased risk for development for DM.  However, a dog with two mutated SOD 1 genes will not necessarily go on to develop DM, which indicates there are other factors involved in the development of the disease that are unknown at this time.
"
"A diagnosis of DM is made by excluding other spinal cord diseases based on exam findings and imaging. Your vet will evaluate your dog for spinal and joint pain and also perform a neurologic evaluation. Based on the physical exam findings, your vet will develop a list of likely causes for your dog’s clinical signs. Your vet may recommend that you meet with a board-certified veterinary neurologist. 
"
"Radiographs (x-rays) may be recommended to evaluate the bones of the spine and hips. One can look for evidence of arthritis, misalignment of the spine (subluxation/luxation), bone cancer (neoplasia), lumbosacral spondylosis, or something else.  However, the spinal cord is not visible on x-rays.
"
"A neurologist will likely recommend advanced imaging, such as a myelogram, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the spinal cord.  These imaging tools can look for compression of the spinal cord, as with intervertebral disc disease, spinal cord cancer (neoplasia), or inflammation. 
"
"Unfortunately, the only test that results in a certain diagnosis of DM is biopsy of spinal cord tissue, which can only be collected after a dog has died. 
"
"A genetic test is available to check for the presence of the SOD 1 mutation to determine if a pet is normal (no copies of the mutated gene), a carrier (one normal copy and one mutated copy of the gene), or has two copies of the mutated gene.
"
" A dog with two copies is at increased risk but may never develop DM.  The genetic test is used to screen for at-risk dogs and those used in breeding programs. A dog that is a carrier for the SOD 1 mutation is at risk for development of degenerative myelopathy, but not at as great a risk as a dog that has two.
"
"The degree of neurological impairment from DM is divided into four clinical stages.
"
"Stage 1: The dog is able to walk but is showing signs of decreased sensation and weakness in the hind limbs. Pup has difficulty rising from a lying position, there is knuckling of the paws, dragging of the feet/wear on the toenails, and stumbling/crisscrossing of the hind limbs. 
"
"Stage 2: The patient is unable to walk on the hind limbs. They are severely weak in the hind limbs and may/may not be able to stand on hind limbs. 
"
"Stage 3:  The patient has paralysis of the hind limbs and weakness involving the front limbs. Hind limb muscles atrophy due to no use of muscles. Atrophy is the process by which a muscle loses mass and tone.  This occurs when the muscle is not being used.  Fecal and urinary incontinence and a change in bark or other vocalizations may be noted. 
"
"Stage 4: The patient is completely paralyzed in all four limbs, has muscle atrophy affecting the entire body, has fecal and urinary incontinence, change in vocalization, difficulty swallowing food/water, and difficulty breathing. 
"
"The iris is a muscle in your dog’s eye that controls the size of the pupil. It’s helpful to think of the eye as a camera, and the pupil is the opening that changes to allow light in. When there is a lot of light, the iris will close the pupil to allow less in. When light is low, the iris will open the pupil to allow as much light in as possible. You can see the iris when you look at the dog's eye. The iris is the ""colored' portion of the eye.
"
"Iris atrophy is a condition that occurs when the muscle of the iris starts to thin. This usually occurs around the edge of the iris, causing a misshapen pupil. It can also occur within the iris itself, leading to a moth-eaten appearance of the colored portion of the eye.
"
"Primary iris atrophy, the most common type of atrophy, tends to show up in older dogs. In secondary iris atrophy, the muscle thins due to pressure within the eye caused by inflammation.
"
"Iris atrophy may have no few or even no symptoms. In some cases, dogs will become sensitive to light because the iris can no longer close the pupil in brighter conditions. In secondary iris atrophy, you might notice your dog squinting and winking more often.
"
"There is no known cause for primary (or geriatric) iris atrophy. Like many changes that come with age, it can just happen naturally. Small, toy breed dogs can be more predisposed, but any dog can develop the condition.
"
"In some cases, iris atrophy is caused by uveitis, or inflammation of a layer in the eye called the uvea. Uveitis has many causes, ranging from systemic disease to ocular trauma.
"
"Iris atrophy is commonly diagnosed during a routine ophthalmology exam. When a light is shined into the eye, vets look for holes in the iris or an abnormally shaped pupil. Your vet may also perfect a pupillary light reflex test. For this test, a bright light is shined in the eye, which should cause the pupil to contract. An abnormal or delayed response from the pupil may be a sign of iris thinning.
"
"If any underlying condition is expected, your vet may perform tests to identify conditions including uveitis or glaucoma. X-rays may be performed on dogs who have experienced trauma that is possibly contributing to the iris atrophy.
"
"There is no treatment for primary iris atrophy in dogs. As a normal part of aging for some dogs, it can’t be reversed. The good news is that, for most dogs, iris atrophy won’t actually affect their vision, although they may become more sensitive to light.
"
"Secondary iris atrophy is treated by addressing the underlying condition, usually uveitis, but it may also be caused by glaucoma.
"
"Dogs with iris atrophy can lead normal lives. There is no way to halt progression of the condition and it rarely causes noticeable symptoms.
"
"Your veterinarian will monitor your dog’s progression with DM with the staging system.  The length of time between stages varies, depending on the dog. Usually, a large dog will need to be euthanized before a smaller dog with similar signs, because larger dogs are more difficult to care for during this stage of the disease.
"
"There is no cure for DM—only supportive care.
"
"Physical therapy in the form of water therapy, walking with a supportive harness/sling, and range of motion exercises can be helpful in decreasing muscle mass loss. Your primary veterinarian or neurologist can direct you to rehabilitation centers near you. Dogs that receive physical therapy can typically keep walking longer than those who do not.   
"
"Massages can also be helpful in enhancing flow of blood through the muscles and can work out tense areas. 
"
"For dogs that are unable to walk, care is needed to keep them clean from feces and urine. Puppy pads or other absorbent pads can be placed under the patient to absorb accidents and make clean-up easier. A patient that cannot get up will need to be turned every couple of hours to help decrease the risk of bed sores. Memory foam bedding and comforters provide good padding between the ground and the patient. Other padding can be placed under the head and between the limbs to ensure the dog is comfortable.
"
"Canine carts or dog wheelchairs may be helpful in maintaining mobility longer. Dogs that are mentally frustrated with not being able to get up and move on their own could benefit from the increased freedom a cart can provide.  The cart, however, needs to be used only when a patient can be monitored.  A dog should not be left alone in a cart, as this increases the risk for injury. 
"
"Typically, a patient with degenerative myelopathy will progress within 6-18 months from when symptoms are first noted to when quality of life becomes a concern and euthanasia is considered. 
"
"Degenerative myelopathy is a non-painful condition.

"Cerebellar degeneration in dogs is a brain disease. As its name suggests, it affects a specific area of the brain known as the cerebellum. In cerebellar degeneration, the cells within the cerebellum die, causing neurological symptoms in the dog.
"
"Symptoms of cerebellar degeneration in dogs include:
"
"Infection with canine herpesvirus either in utero or as a neonate may cause cerebellar degeneration in dogs. A genetic predisposition for the condition is possible in some dog breeds, including Irish setters, wire-haired fox terriers, Samoyeds, chow chows, rough-coated collies, border collies, bullmastiffs, Labrador retrievers, beagles, Kerry blue terriers, Finnish harriers, Bern running dogs, English pointers, Gordon setters, Brittany spaniels, American Staffordshire terriers and English bulldogs.
"
"MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) may reveal a smaller than normal cerebellum. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may be normal or abnormal depending on the individual cause. Biopsy of the cerebellum is the definitive means of diagnosis.
"
"Routine blood and urine testing may be necessary to rule out other disease conditions which may appear similar.
"
"There is no curative treatment, though medications such as amantidine, buspirone, co-enzyme Q10, and acetyl-l-carnitine have shown some promise.
"
"This type of brain disease in dogs can lead to poor coordination and decision making by the dog. Restrict the dog’s activity to safe areas of the household where it cannot be injured. Avoid stairs, sharp objects, swimming pools, and other dangers that could harm the dog.
"
"Because of the loss of coordination, dogs with cerebellar degeneration may require physical aid in eating, though they can continue to eat a normal diet. Nursing care to keep the pet free of urine and feces may also be necessary.

"Dental diseases in dogs can include a wide range of issues, from gingivitis to broken teeth. It’s important to diagnose and treat dental issues as soon as they are noticed to prevent pain, infection, and tooth loss.
"
"Our pets don’t always communicate their pain, but they can show signs like not wanting to chew, preferring softer foods, dropping food, or pawing at their mouth. Research has shown that more advanced periodontal disease can be associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease and systemic inflammation. It is important to work with your veterinarian to ensure that your dog has a healthy mouth.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Gingivitis is inflammation of the gums, the first stage of periodontal disease, and it can be reversed with treatment. It is one of the most common disorders found during wellness exams and is more common as a dog ages. Mild gingivitis can be improved at home with frequent toothbrushing. More moderate to severe gingivitis requires a dental cleaning to scale and polish the teeth.
"
"Periodontal disease is disease of the tissues surrounding the teeth, including the gums, bone, periodontal ligament (that connects tooth root to bone), and cementum (a hard outer covering of the tooth root). The disease starts with gingivitis and then progresses to bone loss around the tooth. Advanced bone loss is what makes teeth loose. Treatment of periodontal disease depends on severity, and ranges from cleaning above and below the gum line, deep root cleanings, bone graft placement around the roots, and tooth extraction. It is extremely common in dogs. Periodontal disease is preventable with routine cleanings and at-home brushing throughout your dog’s life.
"
"The light fuzz you feel on your own teeth in the morning before you brush is called plaque. This is a combination of oral bacteria and proteins from saliva that adhere to the teeth, and it begins to form  just minutes after brushing. Plaque is the instigator for gingivitis, so we are taught at a young age to brush our teeth twice a day to remove it. This is why brushing our dog’s teeth is important too! Tartar, which is mineralized plaque, can only be removed through professional veterinarian scaling and polishing, which requires anesthesia for pets.
"
"Tooth fractures are included in the category of endodontic disease, which is a disease of the pulp of the tooth. The pulp is the inner part of the tooth and includes vessels, nerves, and connective tissue. When a tooth breaks and bacteria enters the pulp, the tooth dies. This can be painful while the nerve is exposed and the tooth is dying. Tooth fractures are treated by extracting the tooth or through a root canal. Extracting the tooth gets rid of a source of inflammation and infection, and a root canal removes the dead pulp and fills the remaining space with a biocompatible substance. Heavy chewing on hard objects like antlers, rocks, crates, hard bones, or toys can fracture teeth.
"
"A malocclusion is an abnormal fit between the teeth and jaw . Some dogs have malocclusions that lead to the teeth hitting other teeth, the palate, or the lips. These problems can arise from the jaws being too long or too short, or if a tooth is in an abnormal position. Malocclusions are painful, and require treatment to either adjust the tooth position with orthodontics or simply extract the tooth so dogs can have a comfortable and functional mouth.
"
"The best treatment plan for dental disease is personalized to each dog, the type of disease, severity of disease, and treatment goals. For dogs with gingivitis or early periodontal disease, the teeth can be treated through scaling and polishing. Small dogs should have their first cleaning by age 2 and large dogs by the age of 3. A cleaning under anesthesia combined with an oral exam and dental x-ray, is the best way to fully evaluate the mouth and treat dental disease.
"
"Some conditions, such as advanced periodontal disease with severe bone loss around the tooth, are best treated with tooth extraction. Extracting these diseased or loose teeth leads to a healthier and more functional mouth, since the pain and inflammation is eliminated. Dogs can eat kibble again and play with chew toys after a short healing period, and their other teeth typically don’t shift following extractions.
"
"Some fractured teeth can be treated through root canals to save the remaining tooth structure. The best tooth candidates for root canals include canine teeth or other large, important teeth in medium- to large-breed dogs. Otherwise, extraction of fractured teeth is ideal to fully remove the dead tooth.
"
"Malocclusion treatment options include moving teeth through orthodontics, extracting teeth, or shortening teeth. Teeth can be moved via applying pressure with orthodontic buttons and elastics, or appliances such as an incline plane or coronal extenders. All puppies and young dogs must be evaluated for malocclusions while they are growing, to avoid mouth pain and other issues associated with malocclusions such as an oronasal fistula (a hole between the mouth and nose), dead teeth, or general tooth wear. Board-certified veterinary dentists can provide occlusion treatment options specific for each pup, so they can have a pain-free mouth for many years.
"
"Periodontal disease is the most common disease of dogs over the age of 3, but it is preventable! Introducing toothbrushing at a young age can make it a fun part of your dog’s daily routine. Start by having your dog lick dog-safe toothpaste off the brush, then slowly build up to brushing the teeth using a dog-safe toothbrush. Brushing the outsides of the teeth with three back and forth strokes is effective. After a successful toothbrushing, be sure to reward your pet with a special treat.
"
"Always discuss your pet’s oral health with your veterinarian during yearly wellness exams. By starting dental cleanings and exams at a young age, gingivitis can be kept in the reversible stage and bone loss that comes with more advanced periodontal disease can be prevented. An investment in cleanings under anesthesia early in your dog’s life prevents discomfort and the need for invasive and aggressive treatment later. Younger animals tend to recover from anesthesia more quickly, and it is safer in pets with no heart, kidney, or liver disease.
"
"In addition to daily or every-other-day toothbrushing, products like dental diets, chews, and water additives can also help reduce plaque and tartar, helping to bind bacteria byproducts that can damage the gums. The Veterinary Oral Health Council provides a veterinary dentist-approved list of these home care products. By working with your veterinarian and starting a dental routine at a young age, you can ensure that your pup has a healthy mouth for many years to come.

"Deafness is the loss of the ability to hear, most associated with senior dogs. However, deafness can happen in dogs of any age, and for several reasons.
"
"Hearing in mammals requires a precise transmission of sound waves through the soft tissue and bony structures of the inner and outer ear. If any of these structures are interfered with through infection or trauma—or if they don’t develop properly—this pathway is disrupted. This results in a loss of the ability to properly perceive sound.
"
"Loss of hearing in dogs may be complete or partial, depending on the cause.
"
"Partial deafness, which involves losing hearing on one side or only being able to perceive sounds at certain frequencies, can be extremely difficult to diagnose because dogs compensate for any hearing loss extremely well.
"
"Partial deafness in both ears is more commonly seen in infectious or inflammatory conditions, such as ear infections (otitis externa). Recovery of a pup’s hearing is more likely in such cases.
"
"While deafness itself is not a medical emergency, painful conditions like otitis and trauma, which can lead to deafness, should be promptly treated by your veterinarian.
"
"Prolonged inflammation makes it less likely for your dog’s hearing to recover.
"
"The following are symptoms commonly associated with deafness in dogs:
"
"Lack of response to environmental sounds
"
"Difficulty rousing a sleeping dog
"
"Confusion about the source of a sound
"
"Excessive barking
"
"Change in bark
"
"Lack of ear movement during communication
"
"Puppies can be born deaf (congenital deafness), usually due to defects in the inner ear. This is the most common cause of deafness in dogs, but it can only be reliably diagnosed in puppies older than four weeks.
"
"Merle and white puppies are more likely to have genes that lead to inappropriate development of the cochlea (the hearing organ). Breeds such as Dalmatians, Cocker Spaniels, Boston Terriers, Australian Cattle Dogs, and Parson Jack Russell Terriers are commonly affected.
"
"Puppies can also exhibit congenital deafness as a result of their mother having an infection during pregnancy or being exposed to certain toxins or medications.
"
"Regardless of the cause, puppies born deaf will not recover their hearing.
"
"Infections in the canine ear can affect the external, middle, or inner ear, and the location of the infection determines how hearing can be affected and whether it is reversible.
"
"External ear infections may cause ear canal constriction and buildup of material, blocking sound waves from entering the ear properly. This typically does not cause complete deafness and often improves with treatment.
"
"Middle ear infections (otitis media) can result in damage to the eardrum (tympanum) and, at times, the bones that transmit sounds.
"
"Recovery from otitis media usually leads to the return of hearing function, although it may take weeks for a full recovery. Additionally, there could be mild lasting effects due to scarring.
"
"Inner ear infections can cause irreversible nerve damage in the cochlea. These infections are often associated with other nerve damage symptoms such as head tilt and circling. Deafness from inner ear infections can be complete or partial, but it’s often irreversible.
"
"Several medications may cause permanent deafness in dogs. While these side effects are rare, they can occur with appropriate doses needed to treat other life-threatening conditions. Deafness can be permanent, but not all dogs will completely lose their hearing.
"
"Cisplatin (a chemotherapy drug), and furosemide (used to treat heart failure) are the most common medications that can affect the cochlea.
"
"Deafness from drug toxicity is often not immediate, but progresses over time with continued use of the drug. Discuss with your veterinarian the risks and benefits of using one of these medications for your dog.
"
"Be sure to follow label instructions regarding frequency and duration of therapy to have the best chance of avoiding side effects.
"
"Dogs with endocrine disorders like Cushing’s disease and hypothyroidism are more likely to develop deafness due to changes in the body’s metabolism, which can alter blood flow and nerve function.
"
"Cancer—whether primary or metastatic—can cause physical changes to the ear or the portion of the brain that receives signals from the ear, resulting in deafness.
"
"Infections of the nervous system—such as meningitis and epilepsy—can also affect the brain’s ability to process sound.
"
"Physical trauma to the brain or auditory system can result in deafness.
"
"Depending on the health of the eardrum, aggressive ear flushing and cleaning with implements like cotton swabs can lead to membrane rupture and inflammation of the inner ear.
"
"It’s important to clean dog ears only as directed by your veterinarian and with products specifically designed for safe use in the ears. Do not insert cotton swabs into your dog’s ear canals. 
"
"Repeated exposure to loud, percussive noises such as gunshots can lead to progressive deafness. This is more frequently seen in military or hunting dogs, and ear protection is available for working dogs who may be at risk.
"
"Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) is a very common cause of slowly progressive deafness in older dogs.
"
"This condition is similar to hearing loss in older humans, typically affecting dogs later in their lifespan. The cause is likely a combination of factors, including genetics, overall health, and lifestyle.
"
"Diagnosing deafness in dogs can be challenging.
"
"Though physical exam can reveal issues like external ear infections and masses, many causes of deafness are not visible or palpable, even with an otoscope (an ear examination tool). Dogs may have variable responses to sounds in the exam room due to excitement or anxiety. This can make the diagnosis particularly difficult in cases of partial deafness because the unaffected ear may easily compensate for the loss.
"
"A thorough history is important for your vet. Inform them of how long your pet has shown signs of hearing loss, whether it seems sudden onset or slowly progressive, and whether your pet has had any medical conditions or medications that may predispose them to deafness.
"
"This will help your vet determine what further testing or treatment is necessary.
"
"Your vet can directly examine the ear canal during a physical exam to assess the external ear canal and eardrum. However, the entire hearing system can’t be evaluated this way.
"
"Your vet will also examine your dog’s ability to balance and how the other nerves in their head and neck are working. Loss of nerve function or balance coupled with hearing loss may point to an issue in the inner ear or brain as a cause.
"
"If your dog’s physical examination is normal, baseline blood work and urinalysis can help identify systemic illness like Cushing’s disease or thyroid disease, which can be treated directly.
"
"Imaging can help with diagnosis as well. Radiographs can help rule out cancerous masses in the chest or abdomen, but visualizing changes in the skull can be difficult with these two-dimensional images.
"
"CT is a more effective method for detecting otitis interna or other trauma to the inner ear. MRI may also be considered if a neurologic cause is suspected.
"
"Given the numerous potential causes of deafness, your vet will help choose which diagnostics make sense to understand and identify what might be causing the hearing issue in your dog.
"
"Treatment of deafness in dogs depends on the cause. With few exceptions, issues with the conduction of sound—such as obstruction of the ear canal, minor damage to the eardrum, or infection of the middle ear canal—are treatable.  A return to hearing can be expected with appropriate care.
"
"Dogs with damage to the cochlea or nervous system, whether congenital or acquired, are less likely to recover hearing. In these cases, treatment should focus on maintaining a pup’s comfort and quality of life.
"
"For dogs expected to regain their hearing, the timeline for recovery depends on the underlying cause.
"
"Removing masses or debris from the ear canal can result in almost immediate improvement and a return to normal function. However, recovery from otitis media or eardrum damage may take weeks, with progressive improvement as the tissues heal and the body heals inflammation.
"
"Whether temporary or permanent, there are a few things that you can do to help your dog through their hearing loss:
"
"Your communication style with your dog may need to change, since auditory commands will no longer be effective.
"
"Puppies born deaf can readily learn visual cues and hand signals, but there might be a learning curve for older dogs.
"
"It’s important to be able to get and keep your dog’s attention to help them navigate their world. Stomping your feet on the floor may be helpful to get your dog’s attention as you approach them, so they are not startled when they see you.
"
"Because your dog does not sense their environment the same way fully hearing dogs do, it is recommended to always keep them indoors, in fenced areas, or on a leash.
"
"Deaf dogs cannot hear cars or bicycles approaching on a road. They are also more prone to be startled by strangers or other animals coming up behind them.
"
"Patches can be applied to your dog’s harness to alert new people that they should approach with caution. Medical alert tags are also available.
"
"To prevent avoidable causes of deafness in your dog, promptly treat suspected ear infections and work with your vet to manage allergies and other causes of otitis externa.
"
"Use vet-recommended ear cleaners and don’t use cotton swabs in the ear canals.
"
"Do not administer ototoxic medications (those that may damage hearing or the auditory system) at higher doses or longer than is recommended by your veterinarian.
"
"It’s best to avoid topical medications in the ear unless your dog has recently been examined. For working or hunting dogs exposed to gunfire or other highly percussive sounds, use ear protection.
"
"Hearing loss is not inherently painful, and deaf dogs can live a very happy life with some lifestyle modifications for safety and stress reduction.

"If you’ve noticed white flakes in your dog’s fur, you might be wondering if they have dandruff  or whether dogs even get dandruff. Yes, they can. Dandruff, or seborrheic dermatitis, is common in dogs and humans alike.
"
"Dandruff is not typically a sign of a serious condition, but you can talk with a veterinarian to find out what may be causing it. Make an appointment sooner rather than later if you see symptoms like extreme itchiness or a change in weight or behavior.
"
"Here’s what you need to know about the types of dog dandruff, what to look for, any possible causes, and best treatment options.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Not all dandruff in dogs looks like white flakes. It can be either dry or oily, or it may not even be true dandruff. The underlying skin may or may not be red or patchy from hair loss. Here are the most common types:
"
"Seborrhea sicca (dry seborrhea): This dry dandruff may appear as white flakes with crusty skin.
"
"Seborrhea oleosa (oily seborrhea): Your dog’s skin may have an oily feel and give off an odor.
"
"Walking dandruff: If the dandruff seems like it’s moving, this is called Cheyletiella and is actually a type of mite.
"
"Dandruff in dogs can be caused by several factors, including:
"
"Allergies
"
"A vitamin deficiency (such as a lack of omega fatty acids)
"
"Hormone imbalance
"
"Immune-related issues
"
"Genetic condition (more commonly seen in American Cocker Spaniels, West Highland White Terriers, English Springer Spaniels, and Basset Hounds)
"
"Low humidity that strips the skin of moisture and dries it out
"
"Health conditions, including hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid glands), autoimmune conditions (pemphigus), and diabetes mellitus
"
"Cheyletiellosis, or “walking dandruff,” is caused by white mites that can be seen with the naked eye. The mites lay their eggs in the dog’s fur and cause extreme itchiness.
"
"Bacterial and fungal skin infections
"
"To diagnose the underlying cause of dandruff, a veterinarian may:
"
"Perform a physical examination
"
"Ask how long the dandruff has been occurring, whether your dog has been scratching (or showing other habits that indicate discomfort), and what your dog’s diet/water intake is
"
"Take skin samples (skin scraping) and material from your dog’s hair to check for mites or lice
"
"Suggest allergy tests, such as a food elimination diet or an intradermal skin test, if an allergen is suspected
"
"Examine skin cells and debris from your dog’s ears for yeast or bacterial infection
"
"Do a tissue biopsy to test for cancer
"
"Do blood tests to screen for:
"
"Diabetes mellitus
"
"Cushing’s disease
"
"Hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroid hormone)
"
"In simple cases, dandruff may be prevented with good nutrition and regular grooming. Some veterinarians may suggest adding omega-6 fatty acids to the diet, but always check with your veterinarian before changing your dog’s diet.
"
"Be sure to talk with your vet for at-home remedies that fit your dog’s situation. Never use anti-dandruff products for humans; these products can be harmful to dogs.
"
"Other treatment recommendations may include:
"
"Bathing your dog regularly, using an oatmeal-based dog shampoo or soothing shampoos such as Virbac Epi-Soothe. Persistent dandruff may require a prescription shampoo to calm itchy, aggravated skin.
"
"Frequent brushing is important to massage the skin and help spread a dog’s natural oils over their body. Using the right brush is also important (one with the right firmness for your dog). Depending on your dog’s coat, you may try FURminator de-shedding tools for different coat lengths, or products like de-matting brushes and shine/condition soft-bristle brushes.
"
"Mites (cheyletiellosis) require extensive treatment because they can live up to 10 days on everyday objects.
"
"All pets with mites should be bathed 6 to 8 times a week. A vet may prescribe rinses containing insecticide and lime sulfur, along with oral medication.
"
"Bedding, kennels, and rugs can be cleaned to prevent reinfestation.
"
"Dandruff can occur in dogs as a result of dry, flaky skin; as a reaction to an allergen; or as the result of a mite infestation.
"
"Dandruff is usually not a cause for concern unless there are other signs, such as constant scratching or symptoms that may suggest a more serious underlying condition, like diabetes or Cushing’s disease.

"A dentigerous cyst is, literally, a cyst on the tooth. It is characterized by a fluid filled sac, similar in form to a blister, which has originated from the tissue surrounding the crown of an unerupted tooth. It occurs in any breed that is at an increased risk for impaired eruption, such as boxers and bulldogs. It tends to occur in the mandibular (lower jaw) first premolars, and often on both sides (bilateral). This condition is diagnosed if the teeth are unerupted at six months old, but a cyst may not form until later, if ever.
"
"The symptoms can include one or more of the following:
"
"Unerupted teeth.
"
"Your veterinarian will search for an oral mass - a benign tumor that forms at the root of a tooth. Tooth structures (complex or compound) are sometimes contained within a cystic structure, that is, the tooth is covered in gum tissue that resembles a sac, but with different levels of organization. Radiographic imaging is essential in any instance of missing or unerupted teeth, and is often used to get a definitive diagnosis. Radiographic results may show evidence of a radiolucent (invisible to x-ray) cyst originating from the remaining enamel organ at the neck of the tooth, and enveloping the crown (a halo).
"
"
"
"If an embedded tooth is present in a mature animal, an assessment will be made of any cystic structure or other abnormal changes involving the tooth; continued monitoring would be reasonable if a surgical extraction would damage large amounts of bone. If a cystic formation is present, your veterinarian will recommend a surgical extraction, with complete surgical removal (debridement) of the cystic lining. If the jawbone has been damaged, your doctor will consider a synthetic bone replacement. Appropriate pre-operative antimicrobial and pain management therapy will be given when indicated, with patient monitoring and support during anesthetic procedures. If there are abnormalities in the growth of a tooth, and it is a non-essential tooth, it would be best to extract it, even if cystic changes are not present.
"
"Pathological fracture of the jawbone may occur if a dentigerous cyst is not diagnosed and treated. If this condition is detected early and treated appropriately, the prognosis is good.

"Cyanosis is the bluish-purple tinge that blood acquires when it’s not carrying enough oxygen. In dogs, this color change is usually easiest to see on their tongue, gums, or inner ears, where the blood vessels are very superficial and the haircoat is thinnest.
"
"Cyanosis is usually due to the lungs or the circulatory system not working properly.
"
"If you are concerned that your dog is cyanotic, it’s a medical emergency that requires immediate stabilization at the nearest emergency vet clinic. 
"
"Try to get your dog to an emergency veterinary hospital or a hospital with an intensive care unit for the most complete care options. If that type of facility is more than 30 minutes away, the closest vet with oxygen will be the best place to start.
"
"Cyanosis is often accompanied by other symptoms of respiratory or cardiac stress such as:
"
"Heavy panting
"
"Coughing
"
"Visible abdominal muscle movement while breathing
"
"Inability to rise
"
"Collapse
"
"Pacing and agitation
"
"Cyanosis can be classified as central or peripheral.
"
"In central cyanosis, the lungs are unable to get oxygen to the bloodstream. This can be due to obstruction of the larger airways (e.g., choking, asthma, or bronchitis) or due to a buildup of fluid or tissue in the lungs from conditions like heart disease, pneumonia, or cancer.
"
"Fluid may also build up around the lungs in these conditions, rendering them unable to expand enough to bring oxygen to the blood. Brachycephalic (short-nosed) dogs such as American, English, and French Bulldogs, Pugs, and Boston Terriers are very prone to central cyanosis due to their narrow airways and sensitivity to heat.
"
"In peripheral cyanosis, the lungs get oxygen to the blood but the circulatory system has difficulty bringing this oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.
"
"Causes of peripheral cyanosis include heart failure, low blood pressure, or shock from infection or allergic reactions, blood loss (internal or external), and blood clots (thrombosis). Cancer and autoimmune disease can affect production of red blood cells in the bone marrow, which may decrease your dog’s oxygen-carrying capacity.
"
"Cyanosis will be easily observed by your vet during a physical exam. Stabilization and diagnostics will be recommended based on the symptoms your dog has and the equipment the vet has available. If your dog is struggling to breathe, they may require sedation and intubation, ventilation, or a tracheotomy to assist in lung function before other diagnostics can be safely completed.
"
"If the upper airways is clear, your vet may elect to place your dog in a special enclosure with higher oxygen levels to allow them to get more oxygen without sedation.
"
"Other diagnostics may include:
"
"A complete blood count (CBC) will show if your dog has appropriate numbers of circulating red blood cells and hemoglobin levels. It can also look for platelet issues that can lead to bleeding disorders.
"
"Blood chemistry can help evaluate for evidence of organ failure from lack of oxygen or concurrent illness, which may affect what treatments are available.
"
"A blood gas analysis, which can reveal how much oxygen is in the blood and how severe the body’s response to the lack of oxygen is.
"
"X-rays of their chest, once your dog is stable, may be taken to look for structural changes that may affect heart and lung function.
"
"If heart disease is suspected, an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) and evaluation of the heartbeat (EKG) may be recommended.
"
"Radiographs of the abdomen may be useful if internal bleeding or abdominal masses are suspected as the cause of cyanosis.
"
"Rarer cancers and metabolic diseases that affect the airways may require advanced imaging such as a CT scan or MRI to diagnose them and help your vet determine why your dog is cyanotic, but this is uncommon.
"
"Depending on the cause and how quickly care is sought and administered, dogs can survive cyanosis. Potentially treatable conditions include airway obstruction from foreign objects or brachycephalic airway syndrome, toxin exposure, anaphylaxis, and trauma—though there may be a long road to recovery.
"
"Blood oxygenation is extremely important to a dog’s normal body function, and unfortunately, death can occur very quickly in some cases.
"
"In other cases, pups may be able to regain the ability to oxygenate successfully in the hospital, but the underlying condition may not be curable, and they cannot be easily managed at home. Many forms of cancer and severe heart disease have poor long-term outcomes despite early and aggressive care.
"
"Recovery from conditions causing cyanosis usually requires hospitalization. Veterinary hospitals can provide patients with highly oxygenated breathing air, improve circulation with IV fluids, and even help the lungs expand through ventilation when they are not breathing normally on their own.
"
"Dogs not stable with normal air oxygen levels cannot safely be sent home. As such, some dogs may not recover.
"
"The prognosis of a dog who does survive cyanosis and is discharged from the hospital will vary depending on their underlying condition.
"
"Your vet will discuss with you the potential long-term outcomes for your dog. Some causes of cyanosis (especially ones that can be treated surgically) will never recur, while others will have to be carefully managed with medications to prevent another episode.
"
"The best way to try to prevent cyanosis in your dog is to be consistent with annual checkups and preventative care:
"
"Heartworm prevention and routine fecal testing can help find and eliminate parasitic causes of heart and lung disease.
"
"Pet parents of brachycephalic dogs should discuss whether airway surgery is needed for their pup.
"
"Annual bloodwork can help monitor changes in red blood cell and platelet numbers.
"
"Dogs with heart murmurs should have a workup with a veterinary cardiologist before there is an emergency, if possible.
"
"Additional tips include:
"
"Coughing dogs should be evaluated promptly with chest X-rays.
"
"Avoid dog toys that are small enough to enter your dog’s airway.
"
"To avoid strangulation, do not leave collars on unattended dogs. Breakaway collars are a great investment if taking your dog’s collar off is not practical. This type of collar is especially important if you have a multi-dog household, as dogs can get their teeth caught on each other’s collars even during monitored play, leading to death or injury.
"
"Yes, if a dog has cyanosis—a bluish tint that can be easiest to see on the tongue, gums, or inner ears—it’s a true medical emergency. The dog needs immediate veterinary care to become stable and to boost the oxygen levels in their blood and tissues.
"
"Appropriate therapy of cyanosis requires veterinary intervention and can’t be performed at home. The best thing you can do while in route to an emergency hospital is to keep yourself and your dog as calm as possible, because rapid breathing, panting, and anxiety can worsen oxygen distribution.

"A ventricular septal defect (VSD) causes irregular communication in the ventricular septum, the wall that separates the ventricles (the two lower chambers of the heart) from one another. This results in blood being diverted, or shunted, from one side of the heart to the other. The direction and volume of the shunt are determined by the size of the defect, the relationship of the pulmonary and systemic blood vessel resistances, and the presence of other anomalies.
"
"Most VSDs in small animals are subaortic (below the aortic valve) and have a right ventricular hole that is beneath the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. In addition, most VSDs in dogs are small and therefore restrictive (i.e., the difference between left and right ventricular pressures is maintained). Moderate-sized VSDs are only partially restrictive and result in various degrees of high blood pressure in the right ventricle. Large VSDs, meanwhile, have an area that is as large as or larger than the open aortic valve in the left ventricle. They are nonrestrictive, and right ventricular pressure is the same as the body’s blood pressure. Only moderate and large defects impose a pressure load upon the right ventricle.
"
"This defect is relatively uncommon in dogs.
"
"Cats generally present no symptoms of the defect (asymptomatic); however symptoms commonly associated with ventricular septal defects include:
"
"The underlying cause for ventricular septic defects are unknown, though a genetic basis is suspected.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, with a complete blood profile, chemical blood profile, complete blood count, urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other concurrent diseases.
"
"Imaging techniques like thoracic X-rays may help to detect larger VSDs, which would cause a left (or even a generalized) enlarged heart from the increased flow of blood through the heart. High blood pressure in the lungs, chronic heart failure and right to left shunts may be visualized as well.
"
"A two-dimensional echocardiographic study, which uses sonographic imaging to view the activity of the heart, may demonstrate heart enlargement. The right heart will also be enlarged if the defect is moderate-sized or large, or if there are other heart abnormalities in addition to VSD.
"
"
"
"Most patients can be treated on an outpatient basis. Large shunts may be surgically repaired during a cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients with moderate or large shunts may also undergo pulmonary artery banding as a palliative (relieves some discomfort but does not cure the disease) procedure.
"
"If your dog  is showing signs of congestive heart failure (CHF), its activity should be restricted. Your veterinarian will advise you on an appropriate physical routine. Your doctor may also advise you to impose a strict low sodium diet if your dog is diagnosed with CHF, to minimize pressure on the heart. Animals that are diagnosed with overt CHF are generally given 6 to 18 months to live with medical treatment. Pets with small shunts may continue to have a normal life span if there are no concurrent disease that are posing a direct threat to their health.
"
"Do not breed your dog if it has been diagnosed with ventricular septal defect, as this defect is thought to be genetically transmitted. Your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up appointments for your dog to follow its progress, retake X-ray and ultrasound images, and adjust any medications or therapies as needed.

"Cushing’s disease—also known as hypercortisolism and hyperadrenocorticism—is a serious disease that typically affects middle-aged and senior dogs. It can be serious if left untreated.
"
"Here’s what you need to know about Cushing’s disease in dogs—from types and symptoms to treatment and care.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Cushing’s disease, also referred to as hyperadrenocorticism, is an endocrine disorder that is common among middle-aged and senior dogs.
"
"Cushing’s in dogs results from overproduction of the cortisol hormone and can lead to various unwanted symptoms and behavior changes, including excessive panting or changes in eating and drinking.  
"
"Cushing’s disease involves the pituitary and adrenal glands. The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and is about the size of a pea. It produces the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and releases it into the bloodstream to stimulate the adrenal glands to produce additional hormones.
"
"These tiny glands are situated on top of the kidneys and produce a steroid hormone called cortisol, which helps dogs cope with stress and regulates many body functions.
"
"When enough cortisol is produced, the adrenal glands normally signal back to the pituitary gland to stop producing ACTH. However, in dogs with Cushing’s disease, this feedback mechanism is faulty, and the adrenal glands continue producing cortisol even when it’s not needed.  
"
"Cushing’s disease in dogs can be categorized into two types—pituitary-dependent and adrenal-dependent. There are several important differences between the two types.
"
"Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism is the more common of the two and results when a slow-growing, benign mass develops on the pituitary gland. Hormones are produced by this mass, which continually stimulate the adrenal glands. This results in enlargement of both adrenal glands. Advanced imaging, such as a CT or MRI, is needed to diagnose a pituitary mass.
"
"Adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism occurs when a mass, which can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous), grows on one of the adrenal glands. The mass produces too much cortisol. With this type, the affected adrenal gland is enlarged while the unaffected gland remains normal in size. An abdominal ultrasound or a CT scan is used for diagnosis.
"
"Cushing’s disease alters a dog’s behavior due to high cortisol levels. Affected dogs usually eat more (appear to always be hungry), drink more (appear to be excessively thirsty), and urinate large amounts more frequently. Additional symptoms of Cushing’s disease in dogs may include:
"
"Panting
"
"Weight loss
"
"Lethargy
"
"Potbelly appearance
"
"Thin skin
"
"Hair loss
"
"Skin infections
"
"Calcified skin (hardened tissue growth or hard lumps underneath the skin)
"
"The most common cause of Cushing’s disease in dogs is a pituitary gland adenoma. This is a benign tumor that grows slowly and secretes ACTH, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.
"
"Less commonly, an adrenal gland mass—either a (benign) adenoma or a (cancerous) carcinoma—develops and secretes excess cortisol.
"
"Dogs who receive corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to treat another medical condition, such as an autoimmune disease or allergies, may develop iatrogenic Cushing’s disease.
"
"Iatrogenic Cushing’s means that the medication is actually causing the symptoms of Cushing’s disease rather than a pituitary or adrenal gland tumor causing the disease.
"
"Since cortisol is considered a steroid hormone, prednisone affects the body in a similar way. Symptoms are typically reversible by discontinuing the medication, under the supervision of a veterinarian.
"
"Certain breeds, including Poodles, Yorkshire Terriers, and Dachshunds, may be predisposed to Cushing’s disease due to genetics.
"
"A veterinarian will start with a physical exam and will speak with you about what symptoms are present and when they started. It’s important to mention if your dog is currently taking any medications. If the veterinarian suspects Cushing’s disease, diagnostic testing can be done.
"
"Two main tests are used to diagnose Cushing’s disease in dogs:
"
"First, a sample of blood is drawn to measure resting cortisol levels. Then, a drug called dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) is administered into the dog’s muscle or vein and additional blood samples are collected after four and eight hours to measure cortisol levels again.
"
"Normally, cortisol would be suppressed after eight hours, but in dogs with Cushing’s disease, cortisol remains increased. This is the preferred testing method and is typically the least expensive option.
"
"A blood sample is drawn to measure resting cortisol levels. Then ACTH is administered into the dog’s muscle. One hour later, blood is drawn again to measure cortisol levels. In dogs with Cushing’s disease, cortisol is increased in both samples.
"
"To differentiate pituitary-dependent from adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease, additional tests may be done, including:
"
"High-dose dexamethasone suppression test: This test is exactly the same as the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test except that a higher dose of dexamethasone is given to the dog. Dogs with pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease typically have suppression of cortisol after eight hours, whereas dogs with adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease do not.
"
"Imaging: Abdominal ultrasound, CT, and MRI can be used to identify pituitary or adrenal tumors.
"
"Blood work and urine testing are commonly done to assess a dog’s overall health and support a diagnosis of Cushing’s disease. Dogs with Cushing’s disease generally have high cholesterol and triglycerides, changes in their white blood cells, and dilute urine.
"
"Most cases of Cushing’s disease can only be managed, not cured. Most commonly, treatment consists of one of the following types of medications:
"
"Trilostane (Vetoryl®): This is a steroid analogue that blocks a certain enzyme necessary for cortisol production, thus decreasing hormone level. This is the preferred treatment option.
"
"Mitotane (Lysodren®): This is a chemotherapeutic medication that destroys part of the adrenal gland so that it can no longer produce cortisol.
"
"Adrenal-dependent Cushing’s disease may be treated with surgery, depending on the type of adrenal gland tumor present and the dog’s general health. Pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease can be treated with surgery or radiation; however, neither is routinely done due to potential complications and limited availability.
"
"Additionally, since dogs with Cushing’s disease generally have high cholesterol, a low-fat diet is typically recommended. Potential diet options include Royal Canin®/MD Adult Low Fat Diet or Hill’s® Prescription Diet i/d.
"
"Cushing’s disease is not preventable in dogs because it develops from pituitary or adrenal gland tumors. However, iatrogenic Cushing’s disease can be prevented through careful dosing and monitoring of dogs who are taking steroid medications.
"
"Dogs who have been diagnosed with Cushing’s disease should have continued monitoring, such as bloodwork and ACTH stimulation tests, for the remainder of their life to ensure the medication dosage is appropriate and symptoms are controlled.
"
"Always ensure you’re following up your dog’s vet appointments and if you notice a change in your dog’s symptoms, especially while on medication for their Cushing’s, contact your vet. Often, your dog’s medication dosage may need to be changed if clinical signs, such as excessive water drinking, are returning.
"
"Unfortunately, Cushing’s disease does shorten a dog’s lifespan. Expected lifespan following diagnosis ranges from one to five years depending on what treatment is chosen.  
"
"Dogs with Cushing’s disease generally have high cholesterol and triglyceride content in their blood and benefit from a low-fat diet.
"
"Dogs require oral medication or surgery to treat Cushing’s disease. There are no natural remedies that are an effective treatment.
"
"Dogs being treated with oral medications such as trilostane to manage their Cushing’s disease should receive monitoring approximately every three months for the rest of their life. Monitoring intervals can vary depending on the dog’s needs and if any additional medical conditions, such as diabetes, may be present.

"Cryptorchidism is a condition found in male dogs in which one or both testicles have not descended into the testicular sac (scrotum). Testicles usually descend around 6–16 weeks of age. 
"
"When a dog is born, the testicles are generally located near the inguinal ring, an area around the groin, and are guided by the gubernaculum, a structure that connects the testicle to the scrotum. During development, this structure is located near the kidney. 
"
"Cryptorchidism occurs when the gubernaculum fails to develop properly, causing the testicle or testicles to fail to descend into the scrotum. If only one testicle descends, it is usually the left testicle, with the right testicle failing to do so. When neither testicle descends, the dog is typically sterile, since the body temperature usually prevents sperm production.  
"
"Cryptorchidism is genetic and linked to the X chromosome. If the parental history of the dog is known and the father had cryptorchidism, there is an increased chance that the offspring may have it. Breeds likely to have the cryptorchidism gene include: 
"
"Yorkshire Terriers 
"
"Pomeranians 
"
"French Poodles 
"
"Siberian huskies 
"
"Miniature Schnauzers 
"
"Shetland Sheepdogs 
"
"Chihuahuas 
"
"German Shepherds 
"
"Dachshunds 
"
"Brachycephalic (smoosh-faced) breeds 
"
"Cryptorchidism may be diagnosed based on family history. When family history is unknown, your vet will do the following in a physical exam: 
"
"Check the scrotal sac and its contents to make sure there are no swellings and that both testicles are present in the sac. 
"
"If the testicles are not palpable in the sac, the vet will palpate the rest of the abdomen and the area near the groin to check for any structure that may feel like a testicle. 
"
"Examine the penis to check for penile spines, which disappear after neutering (6 weeks). 
"
"Additional testing may be recommended, such as an hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) or GnRH (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone) response tests, that is done to evaluate castration status. Typically, a GnRH test is used, when possible, because there is decreased risk of an allergic reaction. 
"
"The only treatment for cryptorchidism is surgery. The dog should be neutered to avoid breeding, and to prevent testicular torsion and testicular cancer, which typically affect the undescended testicle. 
"
"Surgery can be complicated because the undescended testicle must be located first. This can be done using the following procedures: 
"
"Palpation: A procedure that includes using pressure points from fingers to identify a specific area. This may be helpful to determine if the testicle is located near the groin. 
"
"Ultrasound: A medical device for imaging used to determine location of a testicle if it cannot be located through palpation. 
"
"Exploratory surgery: A procedure where the abdominal cavity is opened, and the surgeon inspects various areas of the abdomen for the retained testicle. This typically takes place after palpation and ultrasound since the surgery helps to pinpoint where the testicle may be to minimize surgical time and complications. 
"
"The undescended testicle(s) can be anywhere in the area between the scrotum and the kidney. They may be smaller than normal testicles, increasing the difficulty in locating them. The testicle(s) may be hidden in other tissue. Dogs with this issue will typically have multiple surgical sites to remove and locate both testicles.  
"
"Expect to pay more overall for this issue, as additional testing may be needed to locate the testicles and confirm their presence. There are additional considerations that factor into cost, including but not limited to: 
"
"Increased surgical time caused by attempting to locate the undescended testicle 
"
"Additional surgical sites and materials used during the procedure 
"
"Additional surgeries that may be needed to correct the issue 
"
"Referral to a specialist 
"
"It is important to speak to the veterinarian about the surgical treatment plan to get an accurate range of cost.  
"
"Delaying neutering until 1 year of age is typically recommended for puppies diagnosed with cryptorchidism, to give the testicle(s) time to descend into the scrotum. 
"
"Even if both testicles do descend, it is still recommended to neuter a dog with cryptorchidism, since it is a hereditary defect of the gubernaculum. After the neuter procedure, recovery is typically two weeks total. 
"
"It is beneficial to limit activity to reduce swelling as much as possible. Dogs may wear an Elizabethan collar or another comparable cone to prevent licking and irritation of the surgical site. The site should be checked daily for swelling and redness. 
"
"Discuss surgical aftercare with your vet prior to surgery as well when picking up your dog after surgery to establish a follow-up timeline and make sure that surgical recovery is outlined. 
"
"The most common complications from surgery can include hemorrhage, pain, swelling, surgical site splitting, discharging fluid, hypoglycemia, hypothermia.
"
"No, the condition of cryptorchidism is not fatal. However, it can lead to cancer, which can be fatal.
"
"Yes, cryptorchidism is genetic. It is associated with the X chromosome.

"Cryptosporidium in dogs is a protozoan parasite that can infect pups as well as people. Infection with this parasite can cause acute, chronic, or intermittent diarrhea in infected dogs and people, a condition called cryptosporidiosis.
"
"More than 40 cryptosporidium species have been identified, and the protozoan parasites are found worldwide. Most cryptosporidium species are highly adapted to a specific host type, but some can affect multiple animal species and humans. The species that most commonly infect people and dogs include Cryptosporidium hominis, C. parvum, and C. canis.
"
"Studies performed by the Companion Animal Parasite Council (CAPC) indicate that cryptosporidium infection is common in dogs.
"
"Infected dogs may or may not show symptoms, but they remain a source of environmental contamination—meaning they can still spread the infection.
"
"Most infections that result in symptoms involve puppies younger than 6 months of age because their immune systems aren’t fully developed, which makes them susceptible to complications.
"
"Cryptosporidiosis typically resolves without treatment in healthy dogs, but puppies and immunocompromised dogs may need medications and intravenous (IV) fluids to correct dehydration caused by diarrhea.
"
"Diarrhea in puppies is always considered a veterinary emergency because puppies can quickly become dehydrated, which can be fatal.
"
"When symptoms of cryptosporidium in dogs are present, they may include:
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Lack of appetite
"
"Fever
"
"Lethargy
"
"A dog can contract cryptosporidium by ingesting contaminated water, food, or feces.
"
"Eggs containing infected cells—called sporozoites—are excreted through an infected host’s feces and possibly other routes, such as respiratory droplets.
"
"Once infection occurs, the eggs hatch inside the body and go through several changes. After multiplying, each parasite develops into a male or female form.
"
"These forms mate to produce eggs, which are released into the environment, where other animals and people can encounter the parasite.
"
"Cryptosporidia are extremely tiny, which can make detection of cryptosporidium in dogs difficult. Exams and diagnostic tests your vet may use include:
"
"History—Knowing if your dog was potentially exposed to a toxin or parasite can help your veterinarian diagnose your pup’s condition. In addition, inform your vet if you or any family members or other pets in the household are showing similar symptoms.
"
"Physical exam—Your vet will perform a physical exam to determine if your dog has a fever or other abnormalities.
"
"Blood work — Your veterinarian may recommend blood work, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and biochemistry profile, to evaluate your dog’s organ function and check for abnormalities in their white blood cell count, which can indicate an infection.
"
"Fecal check—Testing can be done on your dog’s feces to determine if they have cryptosporidium, but these samples may have to be sent out to a laboratory, and you will likely have to wait several days for the results.
"
"X-rays—In some cases, your veterinarian may recommend abdominal X-rays to rule out other conditions.
"
"Cryptosporidium in dogs typically requires no treatment if a pup is healthy.
"
"For puppies and immunocompromised dogs, fluid therapy may be necessary to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. In addition, medications such as azithromycin or paromomycin may be prescribed in persistent cases.
"
"Symptoms of cryptosporidium in dogs typically resolve in less than two weeks in healthy dogs, and the prognosis is excellent. Puppies and immunocompromised dogs also typically have a good outcome if they receive appropriate treatment.
"
"Limiting food or offering bland food while your dog is recovering can help their gastrointestinal (GI) tract heal quickly. Some dogs may also benefit when fiber or a probiotic is added to their diet.

"Since cryptosporidium is potentially transmissible to humans, take care when handling your dog until your vet says they are no longer shedding eggs.
"
"Wash your hands after handling your dog and their fecal matter, and only allow healthy adults to clean up after your dog, as children and immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk for infection.
"
"You never know where cryptosporidium may be lurking. Here are a few tips to help prevent cryptosporidium in dogs:
"
"Take water and a portable water bowl with you on outings with your dog, so you can ensure the water they drink is clean.
"
"Don’t let your dog drink from natural water sources or bowls left on the sidewalk by well-meaning vendors.
"
"Keep your dog leashed and don’t allow them to come in contact with fecal matter.
"
"Provide year-round parasite prevention. These products don’t prevent cryptosporidium, but they do protect against other parasites that can weaken your dog’s immune system and make them susceptible to cryptosporidiosis.

"Corneal dystrophy is an inherited progressive condition which affects both eyes, often in the same way. The cornea, the clear outer layer of the front of the eye, is most affected. This disease is not associated with other diseases, and is relatively common in dogs.
"
"There are three types of corneal dystrophy, categorized by location: epithelial corneal dystrophy, where cell formation is affected; stromal corneal dystrophy, where the cornea will become cloudy; and endothelial corneal dystrophy, where the cells of the lining of the cornea are affected.

"Copper is a mineral that is essential to your dog’s diet and overall health. It’s needed for absorption of iron, production of red blood cells, and maintenance of the nervous and immune systems. However, too much copper can have harmful effects on a dog’s body.
"
"Copper is metabolized in the liver, where it’s either stored or sent to other parts of the body. Under normal circumstances, excess copper is broken down and eliminated.  However, in some dogs, copper builds up in the liver and leads to copper-associated hepatopathy, also known as copper storage disease in dogs.
"
"Copper-associated hepatopathy is a relatively common condition in dogs that leads to liver inflammation, which can progress to liver failure and death. Because excess copper can cause a dog’s immune system to destroy red blood cells, dogs with copper storage disease are also at risk for severe anemia.
"
"Copper storage disease in dogs is a medical emergency. If your dog is showing symptoms, take them to the veterinarian immediately. Without appropriate diagnosis and treatment, symptoms will become more severe over time.
"
"Dogs typically don’t display symptoms of copper storage disease until the condition is advanced. Symptoms of copper storage disease in dogs include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Weight loss
"
"Vomiting
"
"Dogs breeds that are predisposed to corneal dystrophy:
"
"Epithelial
"
"Stromal
"
"Endothelial
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, including an ophthalmic exam. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.
"
"Slit lamp microscopy will aid significantly in differentiating the type of corneal dystrophy present, and a fluorescein stain, a non-invasive dye that shows details of the eye under blue light, will be used to examine the eye for abrasions, and to define the shape of the cornea so that your veterinarian can diagnose the corneal dystrophy. Fluorescein dye enables visualization of any corneal ulcers that may be present; these types of ulcers occur with endothelial and epithelial corneal dystrophy. Fluorescein dye is inconsistent in its ability to aid in diagnosis of endothelial corneal dystrophy, and is not of much use in the diagnosis of stromal corneal dystrophy, but it can be helpful in the diagnosis of epithelial corneal dystrophy. A tonometer will be used to measure the interior pressure in your dog’s eyes so as to rule out glaucoma as a possible cause of corneal swelling.
"
"
"
"If your dog has corneal ulcers, they will treated with antibiotic eye medications. Stromal corneal dystrophy usually does not require treatment. Endothelial corneal dystrophy may be treated by using contact lenses over your dog's eyes. Epithelial corneal tags may be removed, if present. Another possible treatment for endothelial corneal dystrophy is flap surgery of the conjunctiva (the lining of the eyeball and the back surface of the lids). While a corneal transplant may be beneficial, results are inconsistent.
"
"Your dog will probably always have some cloudiness to its eyes, even when treatment has been successful. However, if you notice that your dog’s seems to be in pain because of its eyes (e.g., blinking, watering of the eyes) contact your veterinarian, as ulcers may be developing on the cornea. This is prevalent with endothelial and epithelial corneal dystrophy. It is possible that your dog’s vision will remain normal despite corneal dystrophy.

"Copper storage disease in dogs is typically caused by an inherited genetic mutation that prevents the liver from eliminating excess copper from the body.
"
"The excess copper accumulates in the dog’s liver, leading to significant inflammation, cellular damage, and symptoms.
"
"Eating a diet with excessive copper is another possible cause. This may occur if a dog is fed foods that are known to be high in copper, such as beans, potatoes, and shellfish. This is most likely to occur when dogs are fed homemade diets without veterinary guidance.  
"
"Any breed can be affected by copper storage disease, but there are a few breeds more likely to develop the condition. These include:
"
"Bedlington Terriers
"
"West Highland White Terriers
"
"Dalmatians
"
"Labrador Retrievers
"
"Doberman Pinschers
"
"Veterinarians diagnose copper storage disease in dogs using a combination of clinical signs and diagnostic tests. Pet parents should provide their veterinarians with a thorough medical history—including when symptoms started—to aid in the diagnosis.
"
"Additionally, if a pet parent got their pup from a breeder, medical records can help identify dogs who may be at risk for the disease based on their breed and family history.  
"
"Because it can take a while for symptoms to develop and most of them are seen in several other conditions, veterinarians will use additional tests to confirm a diagnosis of copper storage disease. These tests may include:
"
"Blood work—A blood sample to check a dog’s overall health and identify liver abnormalities.
"
"DNA testing—This can determine whether a dog is a carrier of the genetic mutation that causes copper storage disease.
"
"Liver biopsy—A veterinarian uses a needle to collect a sample directly from the liver while the dog is sedated or anesthetized. The samples are sent to a lab to identify excess copper. This is the only test that provides a definitive diagnosis of copper storage disease.
"
"Dogs with copper storage disease require lifelong management. Potential treatment options include:
"
"D-penicillamine—This medication is the preferred method of treatment. It binds excess copper in a dog’s body so it can be excreted in the urine. It can take months or even years to remove all of the accumulated copper by using this medication.
"
"Low-copper diet—Dogs who have been diagnosed with copper storage disease should be switched to a diet that is low in copper, such as Hill's® Science Diet l/d Liver Care or Royal Canin® Hepatic Veterinary Diet. Dogs with copper storage disease who are not genetically predisposed and who have developed the condition due to excess dietary copper also benefit from this option.
"
"Zinc—This supplement prevents copper absorption. While zinc supplementation is not the preferred treatment option, it may be beneficial in some cases.
"
"Copper storage disease is a condition that requires lifelong treatment. Even with treatment, copper will continue to accumulate in the liver of dogs with an underlying genetic mutation. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper accumulation and support liver health.
"
"Supplements that may help dogs with copper storage disease include:
"
"S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe)—This supplement is an antioxidant that supports healthy liver function.  
"
"Milk thistle—This supplement helps reduce inflammation and prevent liver damage.
"
"Ursodiol—This bile acid is an antioxidant that helps reduce liver inflammation.
"
"Because copper storage disease is not typically diagnosed until the condition becomes severe, it’s difficult to fully remove all the excess copper from a dog’s liver. The prognosis is best when treatment is started early.
"
"Because this disease is due to an inherited genetic mutation, it’s impossible to fully prevent it in predisposed dogs. However, for at-risk breeds, a liver biopsy can be performed at a young age to identify concerning changes.
"
"In these cases, treatment options such as a low-copper diet can be started early to prevent severe disease from developing. Additionally, known carriers of the mutation should not be bred.
"
"Dogs with copper storage disease on average survive about 18 months after diagnosis. This is highly variable and depends on the disease’s severity at the time of diagnosis. The more advanced the condition is when it is diagnosed, the shorter the dog’s expected lifespan.

"Acute canine idiopathic polyradiculoneuritis (ACIP) is a creeping paralysis due to acute inflammation of the nerves. This disease is often seen in dogs that live in North America as well as in those areas where raccoons are present but overall incidence is quite low. Any breed is at risk, but dogs that regularly come into contact with raccoons are at increased risk, such as hunting dogs and dogs that live in rural or wooded areas.
"
"Symptoms presented by ACIP are also classified under a condition referred to as coonhound paralysis. Diagnosis with this disease does not necessarily involve an encounter with a raccoon.
"
"Besides the known connection that has been made with affected dogs coming into contact with raccoon saliva, the exact cause of ACIP is still unknown. Viral or bacterial infections are suspected to be responsible, and because of the correlation with the nervous system and neural pathways, an autoimmune link is being researched. It is thought that white blood cells may be attacking the nerves.
"
"Your veterinarian will take a detailed background medical history from you before making the full physical evaluation. You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as whether your dog has had recent contact with a raccoon.
"
"As part of a standard physical examination, routine laboratory tests will include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile and urinalysis. Usually the results of all these tests are found to be within normal ranges. More specific tests will also be done, including specific testing for determination of abnormalities of electric activity in peripheral nerves, and an analysis of the spinal fluid, which will require a spinal tap, and the brain fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF), to look for specific infections that may be causing the paralysis.
"
"
"
"Onset of the symptom may occur rapidly, but in many cases, they are progressive, worsening over the course of days and weeks as the paralysis spreads from the back legs through the body, and the respiratory system becomes more impaired. If the inflammation has progressed to the point that your dog is having difficulty breathing, it may need to be hospitalized for few days until it is fully out of danger.
"
"Some patients can develop severe respiratory problems, requiring ventilator support until the system has recovered enough for the dog to breath easily again. Because affected animals are often not able to drink water, your veterinarian will also administer intravenous fluids if your dog has become dehydrated. Depending on how far the disease has progressed, your dog may also need physiotherapy because of generalized muscle atrophy.
"
"Good home nursing care is mandatory for speedy and successful recovery. Some affected dogs may require special consideration for proper feeding and drinking; you may even need to feed your dog by hand for a few days until it is able to eat on its own again. Rest is essential, and the easiest way to achieve is that is by setting aside a quiet, comfortable space in the home, away from entry ways and heavy use rooms, where your dog can recover. Do not allow the dog to get overexcited, or be bothered by active children or other pets. If it is difficult to limit your dog's movement, cage rest may be considered a more practical option.
"
"While your dog is resting, make sure to check in throughout the day, turning it from one side to the other about every four hours in order to prevent pressure sores, which can result from prolonged rest in one position. Regular bathing is also required to prevent urine and fecal scalding. During the recovery period, stay close to home, with just short, slow outdoor trips for urinary and bowel relief. If your dog is too paralyzed to walk, you may need to consult with your veterinarian about the need for a catheter.
"
"Your veterinarian will brief you on the physiotherapy protocols to prevent further aggravation of weakened muscles, but massaging the muscles and gently stretching the dog's limbs will help to keep the muscles from atrophying excessively.
"
"You may need to take your dog to veterinary physiotherapist for physiotherapy sessions over the course of several months. Stay in touch with your veterinarian, discussing any complications you may notice overtime and progress your dog is making. You may need to take your dog to a veterinarian for a regular progress evaluation every two to three weeks.
"
"Recovery is different for individual dogs. Some may begin to recover quickly, within days and weeks, while others never completely recover. At home care and therapy is essential, in either case.

"Contact dermatitis in dogs is characterized by a skin reaction that occurs after prolonged contact with an irritant known as an allergen. These are typically protein molecules that trigger an immune response—including the production of antibodies—that leads to symptoms like itching, redness, crusting, and pustules on the skin.
"
"The colon is the section of the large intestine that begins at the cecum, the sac that joins the colon to the end of the small intestine (ileum), and ends where the rectum begins. All are part of the larger digestive tract. The main purpose of the colon is to serve as a temporary storage conduit while it performs the function of extracting useful water and salt from the waste. Megacolon is a condition in which waste is remaining in the colon, causing the diameter of the colon to become abnormally enlarged. It is typically associated with chronic constipation, or obstipation – severe, obstinate constipation that blocks the passage of gas as well as feces. Medically, the colon is described as exhibiting minimal colonic activity – that is, the colon is not releasing its contents.
"
"Megacolon can be a congenital or acquired condition. Dogs with congenital megacolon are born with an abnormal lack of normal smooth muscle function of the colon. Megacolon can also be acquired, such as when feces is chronically retained, fecal water is completely absorbed, and the water and matter bond, causing the feces to become solidified within the colon. If concreted feces remains lodged in the colon for a prolonged period of time, distention of the colon will occur, resulting in irreversible colonic inertia (inactivity). Colonic inertia is characterized by the smooth muscle of the colon no longer contracting or expanding to void feces.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. Your doctor will also perform an abdominal palpation (examination by touch) of the colon, and a manual examination of the rectum, by digital rectal penetration (by finger). You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition.
"
"Abdominal radiograph imaging is useful for a visual examination of the colon. Recorded images will show whether the colon is full of feces, if there is a mass blockage in the colon, or if there are any other underlying causes for the megacolon. An internal examination of the colon using a lighted tubular instrument (colonoscope) may be performed if obstructive lesions inside the colon, or in the wall of the colon, cannot be ruled out.
"
"
"
"Most patients affected with megacolon will need to be hospitalized for initial fluid therapy, both to rehydrate the body and to correct electrolyte imbalances. The colon can then be gently evacuated. Your veterinarian will administer anesthesia to your dog, and then manually inject warm water enemas and water-soluble jelly, allowing for the easy extraction of feces with a gloved finger or sponged forceps. If the problem is recurrent or especially severe, and is not responding to medical management, as in the case of irreversible colonic inertia, surgery may be necessary to repair the colon. Most dog can be cured of recurrent megacolon after undergoing subtotal colectomy surgery.
"
"For dogs suffering from megacolon, exercise and regular activity are strongly encouraged for the health and strength of their digestive and abdominal muscles. A low-residue, high fiber diet may also help to prevent recurrences of megacolon. Another alternative is to supplement your dog’s regular maintenance diet with veterinarian approved fiber supplements or canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling). Avoid feeding any bones to your dog to protect against potential injuries to the colon when bones are swallowed, and to prevent clumps of partially digested bone from blocking the intestinal tract.

"This condition is relatively uncommon in dogs, primarily because of the protective barrier provided by their fur coat. As a result, most symptoms of contact dermatitis develop on the parts of the dog’s body that come into direct contact with potential irritants. These areas are usually sparsely haired and include:
"
"The muzzle
"
"Mouth
"
"Armpits
"
"A dog's pressure points (elbows, ankles)
"
"Belly
"
"Groin
"
"Scrotum
"
"Rear end
"
"Paws
"
"Some of the most common substances that can trigger contact dermatitis in dogs are:
"
"Plants
"
"Detergents
"
"Mulch
"
"Rugs and carpet
"
"Fabrics
"
"Plastics
"
"Concrete
"
"Medications
"
"Chemicals
"
"Fertilizers
"
"While localized skin irritation in dogs is not considered a medical emergency, it should still be examined by your veterinarian.
"
"This is because symptoms have the potential to worsen, secondary infections may develop, and your dog may continue to experience a lot of discomfort due to persistent itching and scratching. 
"
"The symptoms of contact dermatitis will often come and go depending on the duration and timing of contact with the allergen. The following symptoms are most common:
"
"Red and inflamed skin
"
"Hair loss
"
"Hardened scales, flakes, and scabs
"
"Darkened skin
"
"Pustules or pimples
"
"Itching
"
"Contact dermatitis is a hypersensitivity reaction that leads to a localized immune response and inflammation when chemicals (such as allergens) encounter the exposed skin of a dog.
"
"Prior sensitization is necessary for this reaction to occur, indicating that the immune system recognizes the allergen as a threat and produces antibodies to fight against it. This sensitization process usually takes about six months to two years to develop. Once it occurs, subsequent exposure to the same allergen will trigger an allergic reaction.
"
"Contact dermatitis can affect dogs of any breed, gender, and age, provided that the dog is older than six months. However, dogs who already have allergies may experience more severe or frequent flare-ups. 
"
"Typically, the distribution of skin lesions on contact surfaces such as the face, paws, belly, and rear are often enough to raise suspicion that your dog has contact dermatitis.
"
"However, though patch testing can be challenging to perform and yields variable responses in dogs, it is the preferred method for diagnosing contact dermatitis.
"
"This process typically involves shaving the hair on your dog’s side, usually a couple of days beforehand, and applying the suspected allergen (such as plant material) directly to the skin for about two days. Any resulting response (with symptoms like those described above) is noted within a few days after the application.
"
"Alternatively, avoidance of the suspected allergen (typically requiring about a week) followed by a “rechallenge” (putting the dog back in the environment or in contact with the allergen) can lead to a response, potentially allowing for a presumptive diagnosis of an allergy. 
"
"Because dogs with other types of skin disease usually have similar symptoms, your veterinarian may recommend additional tests such as a skin impression, skin scraping, or fungal testing (including a Wood’s lamp examination, fungal culture, or fungal PCR) to check for evidence of bacterial and/or yeast infections, mites, or ringworm.
"
"A biopsy—involving the surgical removal of a sample of your dog’s skin—may be needed to rule out more serious skin conditions like pemphigus or cancer.
"
"In complex or persistent cases, a consultation with a veterinary dermatologist may be required.  
"
"While easier said than done, the most effective treatment for contact dermatitis is the avoidance of the triggering substance.
"
"Unfortunately, there is no single medication or vaccine that can completely prevent your dog from reacting to allergens, but there are several therapies that can help provide your dog a relatively pain-free and good quality of life.
"
"In cases where secondary bacterial or yeast infections are present, treatment is required and typically involves antibiotic or antifungal medications. Often, medications such as cephalexin, Simplicef®, or Clavamox® are used alongside fluconazole or miconazole.
"
"Alleviation of itching is accomplished through antihistamines, steroids, or newer medications like Apoquel® or Cytopoint®. 
"
"Topical therapies—including ointments, shampoos, and conditioners containing antibacterial, antifungal, and/or steroidal properties—are often prescribed. Under the guidance of your veterinarian, bathe your dog. This can lessen your dog’s symptoms and make your pup more comfortable and less itchy. 
"
"Some products with fatty acids that can help your pup’s skin and coat quality include:
"
"Vetoquinol® Triglyceride Omega
"
"Hypoallergenic dog shampoos, such as Douxo S3™ CALM
"
"Medicated dog shampoos
"
"Supplements, such as Zesty Paws® Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil for Dogs
"
"These products may also help maintain your dog’s skin barrier and reduce inflammation. 
"
"Additionally, specialized diets designed to strengthen the skin barrier, soothe, and nourish a dog’s skin, and support their immune system—such as Hill’s® Derm Defense™—could be helpful.
"
"Consult with your veterinarian to determine the best topicals, supplements, and diet for your dog, considering their unique medical and nutritional needs.
"
"The prognosis for dogs suffering from contact dermatitis is often good if the offending allergen is identified and avoided. In some cases, dogs may need lifelong medication—such as pentoxifylline or cyclosporine—to reduce their sensitivity. 
"
"While it’s not always possible to completely prevent contact dermatitis in dogs, there are steps you can take to minimize exposure and reduce the risk of recurrence of symptoms in your dog.
"
"Avoiding contact with the allergen whenever possible is key, which may involve measures such as:
"
"Removing carpeted areas or rugs
"
"Removing plants and weeds
"
"Using HEPA filters
"
"Changing the type of water or food bowl
"
"Maintaining a strict flea control regimen 
"
"Barrier methods like recovery collars or T-shirts—as well as more frequent bathing with or without leave-in shampoos and conditioners—may be helpful.
"
"Preventing your dog from excessive licking and scratching is essential to avoid future infections. Additionally, monitoring pollen counts and having your dog examined by your vet at the first sign of itching can help manage and minimize the impact of contact dermatitis.
"
"Contact dermatitis itself is not contagious to other dogs or people. However, due to the frequent use of antibiotics in affected dogs, there is an elevated risk of developing multi-resistant skin infections, and certain precautions should be taken:
"
"Use topical therapies as the first line of treatment.
"
"Perform skin cultures regularly.
"
"Immunocompromised individuals should take additional precautions and discuss their concerns with both their vet and physician.
"
"Symptoms usually appear within 24–48 hours of contact and can resolve in about 7–10 days if the irritant is avoided.
"
"Contact dermatitis can be managed at home, but due to the level of skin disease and itching involved, your dog may require prescription-strength medication.
"
"Sometimes, if symptoms are mild, just removing the offending allergen by bathing your dog with a hypoallergenic shampoo can significantly improve their condition.

"Conjunctivitis, also called pink eye, is a common condition in dogs (just like it is in humans). The term conjunctivitis means inflammation (swelling) of the conjunctiva, which is the tissue covering the eyeball and eyelids. This tissue is a mucous membrane, which is a layer of cells that make mucus.  
"
"Dogs have a nictitating membrane (often called a third eyelid), which is located at the inner corner of each eye and is made of conjunctiva. Normal, healthy conjunctiva is usually pink in color, though it can be pigmented in some dog breeds. When inflammation of this tissue (conjunctivitis) occurs, the mucous membranes swell, become itchy, and turn brighter pink or red.
"
"Types of conjunctivitis include: 
"
"Any breed of dog may develop allergic conjunctivitis, but it’s especially common in any dog predisposed to atopic dermatitis (hypersensitivity to a variety of common substances in the environment). This occurs most often in young adults, but it can occur at any age. Frequent contributors include environmental allergens, such as dust, pollen, molds, mites, perfumes, and shampoos; food allergens (usually certain proteins); and atopy (a genetic tendency to develop allergies). 
"
"Any breed of dog may develop viral conjunctivitis if they encounter viruses that cause inflammation in the eye membranes. These viruses are usually quite contagious and can take 3 to 4 weeks to fully resolve. Examples of viruses that can cause these signs in dogs include canine distemper virus and canine herpesvirus. 
"
"Primary bacterial conjunctivitis is uncommon in dogs, and there are no known age, gender, or breed predispositions for it. More commonly, secondary bacterial infections occur in the eyes because of underlying medical issues. These medical conditions include chronic dry eye, eyelid abnormalities, and corneal ulceration (scrapes to the outer layer). The most common types of bacteria that cause conjunctivitis are Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, which are both very contagious for dogs.  
"
"Other medical conditions that can make a dog more prone to conjunctivitis include: 
"
"Immune-mediated conditions 
"
"Tumors of the eyelid or conjunctiva 
"
"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) 
"
"Eyelid abnormalities such as entropion (rolling in of the lower eyelid), ectropion (rolling out of the lower eyelid), or abnormal eyelash growth 
"
"Blocked tear ducts 
"
"Trauma to the eye from smoke, foreign objects, or pollutants 
"
"Glaucoma (high pressure in the eye) 
"
"Uveitis (low pressure in the eye from inflammation) 
"
"Breed-associated conditions such as nodular episcleritis in Collies 
"
"Parasites (uncommon) 
"
"When your dog has pink eye, the membranes of the eye become red and swollen. Often, they are itching, burning, or painful, causing dogs to rub their faces on rugs or with their paws. Squinting or excessive blinking is often noted because of discomfort in the eye. Normally, there is a cloudy white, yellow, or green tinged mucus-like discharge from the affected eye(s). Green/yellow discharge is usually associated with bacterial infection while clear or white discharge is more likely to be caused by allergies. Usually both eyes are affected or will become affected unless the inflammation is secondary to trauma, eyelid abnormalities, blocked tear ducts, or tumors.  
"
"Other clinical signs such as generalized itching, hair loss around the eyes, nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, and lethargy may also occur. 
"
"The cause of conjunctivitis can be allergic, viral, bacterial, related to an immune system problem, related to a particular dog’s anatomy, traumatic, or cancerous. Often, the same clinical signs are the same no matter what the underlying cause. Usually, the cause requires investigation with your veterinarian through a routine exam.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination as well as a thorough ophthalmic (eye) examination to look for any medical problems that may be causing the conjunctivitis. The main goal of diagnosis with conjunctivitis is to find out what’s causing it and how much damage to the eyes has occurred.  
"
"The ophthalmic examination consists of: 
"
"A full examination of the surrounding eye structures, including the eyelids, fur around the eye, eyelashes, third eyelid, and tear ducts. 
"
"Tear production testing (called Schirmer tear testing), which is a non-invasive test that checks the amount of tears produced by both eyes. 
"
"Corneal stain testing (called Fluorescein stain testing), which is a non-invasive test used to check the outer layer of the eye, called the cornea, for any damage such as scrapes and cuts. A yellowish stain is put in the eye, and a special light in a dark room is used to show any underlying damage. 
"
"Intraocular pressure testing measures the pressure in both eyes, which is helpful in diagnosing glaucoma and uveitis.  
"
"Additional testing—such as bacterial culture and sensitivity, conjunctival scraping or biopsy, allergy testing, viral testing, and ultrasound of the eyeball—and procedures like tear duct flushing are performed when needed. 
"
"Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the conjunctivitis.  
"
"Allergic conjunctivitis is most commonly treated with eye drops or ointments containing steroids. Sometimes oral steroids and antihistamines are also recommended if there is systemic inflammation. Prevention is most important with allergic conjunctivitis, so you must avoid the underlying allergens affecting your dog. Allergic skin testing, flea preventatives, environmental changes, and food trials may be recommended by your veterinarian.  
"
"Bacterial conjunctivitis is often treated with topical antibiotics, though sometimes oral antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications may also be used depending on the severity of infection. Viral conjunctivitis is often treated with time and oral antioxidants to boost the immune system, and sometimes with either oral or topical anti-viral medications.  
"
"Dogs diagnosed with eyelid or eyelash abnormalities will require surgical correction to avoid chronic issues. Dogs diagnosed with chronic dry eye will require lifelong medications to stimulate tear production. Dogs with immune-mediated medical issues will require immunomodulatory medications (those that affect the immune system) both orally and topically, often for their lifetime. 
"
"In general, preventing further damage to the eye while treating the underlying issue is most important for healing. An Elizabethan collar or pet cone is helpful to avoid your dog rubbing their face or scratching their eyes, which can cause abrasions (scrapes) or even perforations (holes) in the cornea.  
"
"Frequent veterinary rechecks are often recommended to check healing and to change treatment if necessary. Your veterinarian may recommend a referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist (eye doctor) or dermatologist if clinical signs do not improve, quickly worsen, or recur and become chronic issues. 
"
"Medications used to treat conjunctivitis include topical gentamicin, tobramycin, oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and triple-antibiotic ophthalmic ointments/drops. Some dogs will need topical and/or oral medications containing anti-inflammatories such as prednisolone or dexamethasone (both corticosteroids). Dogs diagnosed with chronic dry eye will require medications such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus to encourage tear production.  
"
"Terramycin is an over-the-counter antibacterial ophthalmic ointment that may be recommended, although it is not always the recommended or correct therapy for conjunctivitis in dogs. This is found to be helpful in many cases of feline conjunctivitis, including viral and bacterial, but it is not used as frequently for canine conjunctivitis.

"Home remedies can be used to help with discomfort and to keep the eye clean but will usually not treat the underlying medical issue. You can use sterile saline eye wash solutions gently once or twice daily to clean discharge from around your dog’s eye and to flush dust, pollens, and debris away from his eye.  
"
"Do not perform an eye flush at home without first consulting your veterinary team to ensure no further injury is made to the eye.
"
"There are some holistic products that can be administered topically around the eye or orally to avoid tear duct blockage, which can cause conjunctivitis in some dogs. It’s important to discuss options with your veterinarian before starting any products for treating eye conditions in your dog.
"
"Most dogs have an excellent prognosis when recovering from conjunctivitis. Chronic, recurrent, or severe cases may have a guarded (uncertain) prognosis depending on the cause. Many chronic or recurrent cases require lifelong therapy by controlling underlying allergies, stimulating tear production, or treating systemic or ophthalmic immune-mediated diseases. Frequent veterinary visits may be necessary to determine the best course of action and to assess response to therapy.
"
"Conjunctivitis in dogs is often very contagious if viral or bacterial. If your dog is fully vaccinated, then viral transmission is less likely. Viral conjunctivitis is not contagious to humans. Always check with your veterinary to discuss what vaccines are recommended for your pet.  
"
"Though primary bacterial conjunctivitis is rare in dogs, it is possible to spread to humans by direct contact. It is important to wash your hands before and after touching your dog if bacterial conjunctivitis is diagnosed. 
"
"Allergic, cancerous, immune-mediated, and chronic dry eye conditions are not directly contagious to other dogs but can be if bacteria invade the eye.
"
"Some forms of canine conjunctivitis can resolve on their own in dogs with otherwise healthy immune systems, but dogs usually require therapy to avoid chronic changes to the eyes and full resolution of the squinting, redness, pain, and discharge.
"
"If left untreated, inflammation will eventually affect the outer layer of the eye, the cornea, causing scarring, chronic pain, ulceration and/or uveitis (inflammation inside the eye). Besides being painful, this can set up your dog for lifelong chronic infections.
"
"The duration of clinical signs depends on the underlying cause. With appropriate treatment, bacterial conjunctivitis is usually fully resolved within 5 to 7 days. Viral conjunctivitis can take up to 3 to 4 weeks for full resolution.   
"
"Allergic conjunctivitis will persist until the underlying allergen is discovered and eliminated. Chronic dry eye and immune-mediated conditions are often lifelong and require continued therapy.

"Ebstein's anomaly is the medical name given to a type of congenital heart defect in which the opening of the tricuspid valve (on the right side of the heart, between the right atrium and the right ventricle) is displaced toward the apex of the right ventricle of the heart. It is accompanied by various degrees of tricuspid insufficiency, or stenosis (abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel).
"
"An abnormal accessory pathway may lead to rapid heart rhythms. It is very rare, but is occasionally encountered in dogs. A murmur can be heard with a stethoscope at a young age, though it can be much more difficult to hear it if there is stenosis. There is no breed or gender predilection.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms.
"
"Your veterinarian will order an x-ray of the chest, and will look for evidence of right atrial and ventricular enlargement, as well as an enlarged kidney. Echocardiography can also be used to examine the heart and chest, by showing an ultrasound image of the size, motion and composition of the heart and surrounding structure. An electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity and pressure within the heart, will be necessary for verifying a definitive diagnosis of Ebstein's anomaly.
"
"
"
"There is no cure for Ebstein's anomaly, so medical management is the only practical approach available. Surgical replacement of the tricuspid valve can be successfully performed at some institutions. Your veterinarian can counsel you on the  potential benefits of such an operation, and where you can go for medical care. If right heart failure develops, sodium intake will need to be reduced. There are some medications for treating this disease, you will need to work closely with your veterinarian to work out a treatment and medication plan that is appropriate for your dog.
"
"Your veterinarian will set up a schedule for monitoring your dog's progress.  Echocardiogram images will need to be taken from time to time to measure your dog's condition and adjust treatment methods accordingly. Activity should be encouraged for strengthening the heart. Your veterinarian can advise you on what activities will be best for your dog.

"Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital heart anomaly that enables blood flow between the left and right atria via the interatrial septum (the separating wall). Typically, the blood will shunt into the right atrium, causing a volume overload to the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary vasculature, which can sometimes lead to pulmonary hypertension. However, if right-sided pressures are too high, shunting may occur right to left, causing generalized cyanosis.
"
"ASD is more common in cats (9 percent of congenital heart defects) than dogs (0.7 percent), though a recent study from France suggests a higher incidence, with ASD accounting for 37.7 percent of congenital cardiac defects in pooled data from dogs and cats.
"
"ASD occurs in one of three locations: lower atrial septum (ostium primum defect, which is the most common), near the fossa ovalis (ostium secundum defect), or craniodorsal to the fossa ovalis (sinus venous defect). Common signs associated with ASD include:
"
"The underlying cause of atrial septal defect is currently unknown.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel.
"
"X-rays and electrocardiograms will typically show right-sided heart and lung vessel enlargement in patients with large defects, while an echocardiogram may reveal right atrial and right ventricular dilation and the actual hole (a septal dropout). Arrhythmias and intraventricular conduction disturbances may also be visible using these diagnostic procedures. To document the blood flow through the hole and high ejection velocity through the pulmonary artery, doppler echocardiography is useful.
"
"  
"
"
"
"Dogs with congestive heart failure should be hospitalized until they are stable. Open heart surgery may be necessary to repair the defect, but this is often very expensive. Consult with your veterinarian the best and most affordable course of treatment for you and your pet. For some secundum-type defects, an amplatzer device may be implanted to close the hole.
"
"The prognosis in dogs with ASD depends on the size of the defect and coexisting abnormalities, though it is often guarded to poor. Small, isolated defects, for example, are unlikely to progress, while primum-type defects are typically larger with a worse prognosis.

"Paraneoplastic syndromes may be seen in any dog with a malignant (most common) or benign tumor (rare). Paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) are a group of disorders that result from the abnormal secretions of a hormone or hormone-like product from a cancerous tumor, or from the body's immune response to the tumor. These secretions affect the related tissues or organs (that is, the tissues and organs that are directly related to the affected organ) and generate an abnormal clinical response in dogs dealing with cancer.
"
"Such a response is not due to the invasiveness of the primary tumor, but is a secondary response to the abnormal secretions that are produced by the malignant or benign tumor. Symptoms depend on the response of the tissue or organ that is being targeted.
"
"The symptoms will vary greatly depending on the type of tumor and on the organ system being affected by the abnormal secretions from such tumors. This type of disorder is most commonly related to a malignant tumor, but it can also result from a benign tumor that is secreting hormones. This latter type of tumor is rarer than the malignant type, in this instance.
"
"Other      symptoms depending on the type, location, and stage of tumor.
"
"Tumor and/or presence of cancer in the body; hormone or hormone-like secretions released by the tumor.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms. After taking a complete history, your veterinarian will conduct a detailed physical examination. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. These laboratory tests will return evidence of an immune system response to the cancer, and will also measure the effects the tumor secretions are having on various tissues and organs in the body.
"
"Imaging studies will include radiographs of the thoracic (chest) cavity to rule out cancer in the lungs, and of the abdomen to confirm or rule out cancer of the organs situated therein. Ultrasound imaging will also be used to examine the structure of the internal organs and the adrenal glands. Biopsies of affected organs may be taken for further diagnosis, and if skin disorders are present, samples will betaken of the affected areas.
"
"
"
"Treatment of such disorders is highly individualized and will depend on the type, location, and stage of the tumor. If your dog has been suffering from anorexia and wasting, it will need to be placed on nutritional support and stabilized before further invasive treatments can begin. Invasive treatment is necessary, under the circumstances, as the type of tumor is most likely of a highly malignant nature. Your veterinarian will remove the tumor, if possible. Chemotherapy may also be an option, if the tumor is of the type that is likely to respond to chemical therapy. Your doctor will discuss these options with you.For some patients, where the underlying tumor cannot be removed or treated, management of the clinical signs and treatments to improve the quality of life will be planned.
"
"The overall prognosis depends on the underlying tumor and its treatment, but in general,  the malignant nature of the tumors that cause paraneoplastic syndromes often leads to a fatal outcome.

"Noncardiogenic edema is caused by an increased permeability (or the ability to pass through, as by osmosis) of the blood vessels of the lungs. This increased permeability results in the leakage of fluid into the lung, causing edema, or swelling. If this becomes severe, the edema may be accompanied by an inflammatory response and an accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lung.
"
"There are several factors which can cause changes in the permeability of the lung’s blood vessels. Dogs that have edema as a result of a brain disorder, from a response to an electric cord bite injury, or from an upper airway obstruction might experience a systemic release of catecholamines (neurotransmitters and hormones). This release would lead to a causative effect, with systemic constriction of blood vessels shunting blood into the lungs and overloading the blood vessels of the lung, damaging them, and leading to inflammation and swelling of the lungs.
"
"Manifestation of a generalized inflammatory response in the lungs develops in patients with a bacterial infection of the blood, or with pancreatitis, and will often worsen over the 24 hours following the initial episode. The most seriously affected patients may progress from apparently normal health to a fatal condition only hours after the incident.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms.
"
"He or she will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Arterial blood gas measurement, and pulse oximetry will also be performed, along with coagulation testing (whether the blood is clotting normally). Radiograph images of the thoracic (chest) cavity are essential for making a definitive diagnosis, and an echocardiogram may also be performed to rule out, or confirm, pulmonary (lung) edema caused by heart disease.
"
"
"
"Your dog will be hospitalized if it is experiencing severe respiratory dysfunction. Dogs with moderate to severe disease are given oxygen therapy and cage rest in a quiet environment to minimize stress, since anything that can bring on anxiety may cause the production of stress hormones. Some dogs may be put on a mechanical respirator if they are having too much of a problem breathing on their own.
"
"Often, dogs with noncardiogenic edema will worsen before improving. Severely ill patients have a poor prognosis. However, mild to moderately ill patients stand a good chance of full recovery, and the long-term prognosis is excellent for recovered patients. One of the ways you can prevent noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in your dog is by taking steps to prevent it ffrom chewing on electrical wires. Another way to prevent noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is to get immediate veterinary treatment for your dog at the first sign of seizures or other indications.

"
"Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a condition in which fluid builds up (congests) due to the heart’s reduced ability to pump blood efficiently throughout the body.
"
"A damaged heart may struggle to pump blood, which can cause blood to back up in the lungs that can lead to fluid accumulating in the chest, abdomen, or both, depending on the type of CHF.
"
"A dog’s heart consists of a right and left side, as it does in people. The right side is responsible to receive oxygen-poor blood from the body and transport it to the lungs where it receives oxygen. The left side is responsible for pumping the oxygen-rich blood back out to the body to nourish the tissues.
"
"CHF can be described as right-sided or left-sided:
"
"The risk and progression of CHF in dogs is classified by stages similar to the way it is categorized for humans with CHF. The stages run from an initial risk for developing CHF but not showing any symptoms (Stage A) to severe symptoms (Stage D).
"
"Symptoms of CHF in dogs can be one or more of the following clinical signs:
"
"Coughing, sometimes even coughing up foam
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Increased rate of breathing, even when resting
"
"Inability to exercise
"
"Fatigue, lethargy and weakness
"
"Cyanotic (blue) gums 
"
"Distended abdomen
"
"Collapse or sudden death
"
"Seek an emergency vet immediately if your dog is experiencing any signs of respiratory distress or trouble breathing. Your dog may need hospitalization and immediate care when experiencing moderate to severe signs of congestive heart failure.
"
"There are many possible causes of congestive heart failure in dogs but the most common is myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), also called chronic mitral valve disease, degenerative mitral valve disease, mitral insufficiency, or endocardiosis.
"
"The mitral valve, also known as the bicuspid or left atrioventricular valve, is on the left side of the heart and acts as the doorway between the left atrium and the left ventricle. MMVD occurs when the doorway fails to close, which results in blood leaking through this valve. Over time, it results in left-sided congestive heart failure due to a decreased ability for the left side of the heart to pump oxygen-rich blood to the body. The cause of mitral valve disease is unknown, but there does seem to be a strong genetic component. Many small-breed dogs have a genetic predisposition for mitral valve disease as a cause of congestive heart failure. 
"
"In large-breed dogs, the most common inherited form of heart disease is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), characterized by the heart muscle becoming weak and unable to properly contract. This causes the heart to dilate. Some examples of dogs predisposed to DCM include Doberman Pinschers, Boxers and Great Danes.  
"
"Other causes of CHF in dogs include:
"
"Heart valve disease
"
"Defects or holes in the walls of the heart (ventricular septal defect) 
"
"Congenital cardiac defects (patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonic stenosis and aortic stenosis) 
"
"Accumulation of fluid in the sac around the heart (pericardial effusion) 
"
"Heartworm disease 
"
"Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) 
"
"Increased blood pressure 
"
"Infection (endocarditis) 
"
"Tumors (chemodectoma, lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma) 
"
"Diagnosing congestive heart failure will start with listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Most dogs will have a heart murmur which will be graded in severity from 1 to 6.  
"
"Grade 1: Very soft murmur, often difficult to hear 
"
"Grade 2: Soft murmur but readily heard
"
"Grade 3: Moderately loud murmur
"
"Grade 4: Loud murmur
"
"Grade 5: Very loud murmur that can be heard with the stethoscope, barely touching the chest. The vet can feel a vibration through the chest wall over the heart (palpable thrill)
"
"Grade 6: Very loud murmur that can be heard with the stethoscope of the chest (not touching the skin). The vet can feel a vibration through the chest wall over the heart (palpable thrill) 
"
"If your veterinarian suspects CHF, he or she will likely want to perform a chest X-ray/radiograph to check for heart enlargement or evidence of fluid on the lungs (pulmonary edema). Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) may also be used to assess the rate and rhythm of the heart.
"
"At this point, your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary cardiologist for more specialized testing such as an echocardiograph or ultrasound of the heart. An echocardiograph is the most useful tool to identify the source of a murmur, the likely cause of CHF, and a measurement of the heart’s ability to pump blood.
"
"Your vet will likely recommend treating both the underlying heart disease (if possible) as well as any fluid accumulation. An underlying cause such as heartworm disease may be treatable, but in most cases the cause of congestive heart failure cannot be cured; it can only be managed.
"
"The specific medication used to treat CHF in dogs will vary depending on the underlying cause and severity. Your veterinarian or cardiologist will determine the appropriate drugs, dosages and frequency, and should be consulted before any changes.  
"
"The mainstay of congestive heart failure treatment medically is typically diuretics (water pills). Diuretics decrease the fluid accumulation in the lungs, abdomen or legs, depending on the initial cause of heart failure.
"
"Pimobendan is another commonly used medication in the treatment of CHF. This drug improves the ability of the heart to contract, increases pumping action, opens blood vessels and reduces the amount of work the heart has to do to perform.
"
"In treating myxomatous mitral valve disease and dilated cardiomyopathy, Pimobendan has been shown to delay the onset of heart failure and increase overall survival time, when started before symptoms appear (stages A and B CHF).  
"
"Other medications that can be useful in CHF may include Digoxin, Diltiazem, Angiotensin-converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Your dog will likely be placed on a combination of medications — tailored by your veterinarian—to address their specific CHF and underlying heart disease.  
"
"Dogs with left-sided heart failure, or those with significant fluid in the lungs, may not be able to get enough oxygen from their lungs to their blood stream. In such cases, a dog may benefit from oxygen supplementation.
"
"Your dog may be placed in an oxygen cage, or provided oxygen via tube through the nose. Alternatively, direct airflow toward the face may be provided (called “flow by” oxygen).
"
"In severe cases, a dog may need to be intubated (placing a tube down the trachea) to administer oxygen or even mechanical ventilation (having a machine breathe for them), but this is associated with a poor prognosis. 
"
"Nutritional management and diet may be used in addition to medical therapies. Nutrition tailored to your dog’s underlying heart condition may help slow the progression of heart disease and improve quality of life. Nutritional goals, diet recommendations and supplements should always be discussed with your primary veterinarian, veterinary cardiologist or potentially a veterinary nutritionist.  
"
"Specific dietary supplements such as fish oil/omega fatty acids, taurine and L-carnitine may be considered to decrease inflammation, help manage arrhythmias and improve heart function.  
"
"Other recommendations may include weight management, maintaining muscle mass and eating a balanced diet. Again, your veterinarian, cardiologist, and/or veterinary nutritionist should be consulted prior to any diet changes or addition of any supplements.
"
"Recovery and management will vary based on the cause of the CHF and should be tailored to your specific dog by your veterinarian and/or veterinary cardiologist. However, most dogs will be able to enjoy a moderate level of exercise and activity without strict restrictions.  
"
"One important aspect of at-home care in left-sided congestive heart failure patients is monitoring the respiratory rate, which is the number of breaths per minute. The respiratory rate can indicate the level fluid accumulation in the lungs and help determine if you need to see your veterinarian.
"
"As a rule of thumb, a dog at rest should have a respiratory rate of less than 30 breaths per minute. Be sure to count in and out as one breath and be sure the dog is at rest or sleeping when you count. Do not try to count its respiratory rate immediately after physical activity.  
"
"Your veterinarian will also monitor periodic chest X-rays to assess the heart size as well as any evidence of fluid in the lungs. Blood work, including kidney values and electrolytes, will likely be recommended every 3-6 months to ensure your pet is tolerating the heart medication. The veterinary cardiologist will likely want to recheck an echocardiogram every 6-12 months to assess changes in the heart and make adjustments in medication as needed.  
"
"There is no cure for congestive heart failure in dogs, but with diligent management and daily medications, your dog can have a good quality of life and likely extend its survival time. However, once stage D congestive heart failure develops, the median life range is nine months.
"
"Once congestive heart failure develops, survival time in dogs is expected to be between 6 to 14 months at stage C. Early detection and proper medical care are keys to improving a dog’s prognosis.
"
"Stage D is referred to as “end-stage” disease. In this final stage, a pet will typically have severe symptoms of disease that unfortunately no longer respond to medications or other treatments. These symptoms include cough and coughing up foam, difficulty breathing, increased respiratory rate/effort even when resting, inability to exercise, fatigue/lethargy/weakness, cyanotic (blue) gums, distended abdomen, and collapse/sudden death.
"
"The pet parent should take their dog to the local emergency vet immediately if congestive heart failure or respiratory distress is suspected. 
"
"Dogs in congestive heart failure typically do not display obvious signs of pain. However, humans in congestive heart failure have described chest pain as a factor, so it’s possible dogs also experience some discomfort. Seek veterinary care if you feel your pet is in pain.

"The trachea is the large tube that carries air from the nose and throat to the small airways (bronchi) that go to the lungs. Collapse of the trachea occurs when there is a narrowing of the tracheal cavity (lumen) during breathing. This condition may affect the part of the trachea that is located in the neck (cervical trachea), or the lower part of the trachea, located in the chest (intrathoracic trachea).
"
"Though tracheal collapse can occur in dogs of any age or breed, it appears to be more common in Miniature Poodles, Yorkshire Terriers, Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, and other small and toy breeds.
"
"Symptoms of tracheal abnormalities seem to be aggravated by heat, excitement, exercise or obesity. The following symptoms are commonly observed in affected animals:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including a background history of symptoms. After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your dog. The routine laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of the complete blood count may show an abnormally high number of white blood cells (WBCs), indicative of infection.
"
"Diagnostic imaging is an essential part of the diagnostic process, since the lungs and trachea will need to be examined as completely as possible. Chest X-ray remains a valuable tool, and may reveal a collapsed trachea as well as to help your veterinarian find the location of collapse. In some cases, enlargement of the right side of the heart may also be found.
"
"Fluoroscopy, another advanced diagnostic technique, but one which can provide real time, active images of the internal body, may also be used for your dog. Fluoroscopy works by using an X-ray device placed in front of a fluorescent screen, with the patient on the other side of the screen, so that the physician can see the internal structure in motion, allowing for a more refined image and a more accurate assessment and diagnosis.
"
"Your veterinarian may also take a tissue sample from the inside of the trachea for laboratory testing. This sample will be used to grow the bacteria in the tissue in order to determine if there is any harmful bacteria present in the tracheal tube, and conduct culture testing to see the types of cells that are present in the sample.
"
"In order to grade the severity of the collapse, another technique called bronchoscopy can also be used. In this procedure, the bronchoscope, a tubular instrument with a camera attached, is threaded into the trachea and the images are retrieved and relayed onto video equipment where they can be reviewed and assessed in the process of making the diagnosis. Bronchoscopy is a more invasive method than the standard X-rays, but it can give a much more detailed view of the various abnormalities present in the tracheal tube, including foreign bodies, bleeding, inflammation, or tumors inside the airways. Bronchoscopy can also allow for estimating the degree of narrowing in the trachea, which may range from a grade-1 to grade-6 degree, measured on the basis of increasing severity. The bronchoscope can even be used to collect tissue and fluid samples from deeper within the tracheal canal for laboratory testing.
"
" 
"
"Hospitalization will be required if your dog is having severe symptoms and is not able to breathe properly. To compensate for respiratory problems oxygen therapy is administered. It is also typical to heavily sedate dogs with a collapsed trachea. This is so that they are not suffering, but also so that they are not fighting against the physical restrictions caused by the disease and against the treatments that are being used. Activity needs to be kept as minimal as possible until the dog has stabilized.
"
"There are several drugs that can be used in the treatment of tracheal collapse. Cough suppressant medication can be used to minimize the stress related to the continuous coughing that is commonly associated with tracheal collapse, and your veterinarian will also give medication to dilate the small airways to facilitate normal breathing. Other drugs for reducing inflammation in the trachea will also be started to reduce the symptoms. In some cases, surgery may be required, especially if obstruction is a problem. However, complications are common in these patients after surgery.
"
"Though complete rest is recommended for these patients during recovery, gentle exercise and adherence to a healthy diet is highly advised for reducing weight on a long-term basis. Weight reduction plays an important role in the relief of symptoms, and most dogs respond well to a well planned weight reduction program. Talk to your veterinarian or veterinary nutritionist about a weight-loss program that is best suited to your dog's weight, age, health condition and breed.
"
"Overexcitement is discouraged in these animals, as it may precipitate a crisis for their already compromised lung function. Gentle exercise is best, and you should use a harness instead of a collar and leash, which puts undue pressure on the throat area, further compromising breathing. The prognosis for remission from the disease is good if proper treatment and weight loss can be achieved.

"Collie eye anomaly (CEA), or choroidal hypoplasia, is an inherited congenital disease.
"
"Typically, this condition is present at birth in affected dogs, resulting from a DNA mutation. CEA usually affects both eyes, but one eye can be more severely affected than the other.
"
"The condition develops when blood vessels in the choroid (the layer of tissue in the back of the eyeball) that should be carrying nutrients to the retina (the part of the eye that senses light) do not develop properly in the womb.
"
"This causes dysfunction in a pup’s retina, leading to blind spots in their normal visual field. If the choroidal layer separates from the retina, retinal detachment may occur and lead to blindness.
"
"Sudden onset of choroidal hypoplasia can also develop in puppies who have an abnormal development in the womb.
"
"This is typically the result of the mother’s poor maternal health during her pregnancy, including exposure to toxins, infections, or poor nutrition.
"
"With either scenario, the result is underdevelopment of the choroid vessel layer, leading to retinal problems in dogs.
"
"Other breeds (aside from both Rough and Smooth Collies) that may be affected by this condition include Shetland Sheepdogs (Shelties), Australian Shepherds, and Border Collies.
"
"Less commonly affected—but still on the list of breeds that can carry the gene mutation—include:
"
"Lancashire Heelers
"
"Boykin Spaniels
"
"Longhaired Whippets
"
"Hokkaidos
"
"Silken Windhounds
"
"Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers
"
"Mixed breed dogs with Collie-type lineage may also be at risk.
"
"CEA typically does not cause pain, but dogs can suddenly go blind if they experience retinal detachment.
"
"Retinal detachment by itself is not a painful condition, but it can cause bleeding in the back part of a dog’s eye (fundus).
"
"Blood accumulation inside the eye causes an increase in intraocular pressure (glaucoma), which can be very painful.
"
"It may lead to blindness or require surgery to remove the affected eye (enucleation) if the pain cannot be adequately controlled.
"
"Some symptoms of Collie eye anomaly may include:
"
"Microphthalmia (smaller than normal eyeballs)
"
"Anophthalmia (sunken eyeballs)
"
"Cloudy appearance to the eyes
"
"Coloboma (a hole in the retina)
"
"Retinal folds, which occur if the retinal tissue is too large for a dog’s eye.
"
"This often resolves by 12 weeks of age, which is why early examination with a veterinary ophthalmologist can be crucial in correctly diagnosing the condition.
"
"Retinal detachment
"
"CEA occurs due to a DNA mutation.
"
"This is an autosomal recessive condition—meaning that affected puppies inherit a copy of the mutated gene from both of their parents.
"
"CEA is passed from parents to their pups as an autosomal recessive gene. This means that a puppy must receive one copy of the mutated gene from each parent to show symptoms.
"
"Puppies who receive one normal gene and one mutated gene are considered carriers of CEA. While carriers won’t experience symptoms, there’s still the potential for a carrier puppy to pass on the mutated gene. This happens when the affected dog has their own pups with another carrier as an adult.
"
"Typically, CEA is not considered a progressive disease, meaning that any symptoms present at birth shouldn’t worsen with age.
"
"Some symptoms, like retinal folds, may even resolve as a puppy matures. However, if an affected dog does develop retinal detachment, this can progress to complete and irreversible blindness.
"
"CEA can be diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist as early as six to eight weeks of age.
"
"Veterinary ophthalmologists may use drops to dilate the eye for a more detailed exam with an ophthalmoscope (a specialized tool that allows a vet to look at the back of the eye) to look for abnormalities.
"
"Retinal folds, underdeveloped choroidal blood vessels (choroidal hypoplasia), and colobomas may be visible in the back of the eye after a dog’s pupil is completely dilated.
"
"Puppies should be examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist—ideally before they are 12 weeks of age—for a diagnosis.
"
"During the exam, the veterinary ophthalmologist will place drops in a puppy’s eyes to dilate their pupils (with the same type of drop a human eye doctor would use to examine your eyes).
"
"Once the pupils are dilated, the veterinarian can see into the back of the eye to look for abnormalities with the retina, the blood vessels in the choroid layer, and the optic nerve.
"
"Carriers of CEA can also be identified through genetic testing, which can identify affected dogs with up to 95% accuracy. Genetic testing for CEA requires a blood sample, which can be collected by your vet.
"
"Pet parents should monitor at-risk puppies for signs of impaired vision, which may include behavioral changes like:
"
"Clumsiness (bumping into furniture or walls)
"
"Misjudging distances when jumping or having difficulty navigating stairs
"
"Difficulty locating toys or food/water bowls
"
"Anxiousness in new surroundings or around unfamiliar people or animals
"
"Reluctance or refusal to go outdoors
"
"A change or decline in normal play behaviors
"
"Physical changes may include cloudiness to the eyes, smaller eyeballs (microphthalmia) or a noticeably sunken appearance (anophthalmia) to a pup’s eyes
"
"There is no treatment for Collie eye anomaly.
"
"If a puppy is born with CEA but is not completely blind, there are treatments available that a veterinarian can use to help preserve the puppy’s vision later in life if they develop complications.
"
"However, the disease is not reversible.
"
"Depending on the severity of symptoms, there may be some benefit to the use of prescription eye medications to control symptoms if glaucoma develops.
"
"Discuss the benefit of these medications with your veterinary ophthalmologist and if they are right for your pup.
"
"A dog’s overall quality of life should not be significantly affected with CEA, since they usually begin experiencing vision issues soon after birth.
"
"CEA itself is not painful and does not cause affected dogs to experience discomfort unless complications develop, such as retinal detachment, bleeding into the back of the eye, and an increase in intraocular pressure, leading to glaucoma.
"
"Laser surgery may be helpful in repairing partial retinal detachment caused by the presence of a coloboma in some dogs.
"
"Cryosurgery is another option for repairing partial retinal detachments to prevent them from becoming fully detached.
"
"During this procedure, your vet will freeze the cells in your pup’s tissue to create a scar, which helps reattach loose parts of the retina to the back of the eye to preserve their vision.
"
"Lifestyle changes for dogs with CEA usually involve a daily routine both indoors and outdoors. 
"
"A few tips to keep your pup safe and happy include:
"
"Keep furniture in the same configuration throughout the house
"
"Place dog gates to protect dogs from accidental injury (falling down stairs)
"
"Install pool deck fencing to protect them from accidental drowning
"
"Keep the same location for their food, water, and bedding. This will help minimize your dog’s anxiety of not being able to “find” familiar items in the home if they cannot see.
"
"Halo devices can also be used to protect dogs from bumping into sharp corners or objects at eye level.

"Colitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of a dog’s colon, also known as the large intestine.
"
"The colon is the last part of the gastrointestinal system, following the small intestine.
"
"By the time food gets to a dog’s colon, most of the nutrients have been absorbed, but a large, natural bacterial population within the colon further digests any leftover undigested food.
"
"The colon also absorbs water, so when it’s inflamed and its cells aren’t functioning well, water isn’t absorbed properly, and it is expelled as diarrhea. 
"
"There are two forms of colitis in dogs:
"
"Acute colitis refers to a sudden onset of symptoms that typically lasts only a few days. We see this often in dogs, and it usually clears up on its own.
"
"Chronic colitis lasts for longer—from weeks to months. With chronic colitis, your dog will have multiple episodes of symptoms that keep coming and going, or symptoms that simply keep going. Either way, chronic colitis in dogs often requires a medical workup.
"
"Signs of colitis in dogs include:
"
"Urgency in needing to go to the bathroom
"
"Soft or liquid stool
"
"Straining or pain with defecation
"
"More frequent bowel movements of smaller volume
"
"Stool containing blood or mucus
"
"Dog colitis symptoms will also vary depending on whether your dog has chronic or acute colitis.
"
"Dogs with chronic colitis are typically healthy and seem fine but have soft stools that might contain blood or mucus.
"
"Dogs with acute colitis often have a sudden onset of diarrhea that ranges from soft stool to straight liquid. Their stool might also have some bright-red blood and/or mucus.
"
"If your dog has acute colitis, they may have to urgently go outside multiple times and will sometimes go to the bathroom inside the house, despite being house-trained. They might appear to be straining to defecate as well. Vomiting can also occur, but it is not common.
"
"In addition to presenting differently, acute and chronic colitis often have different causes.
"
"Stress (e.g., boarding, traveling, moving, or environmental changes)
"
"Dietary indiscretions (e.g., too many treats, eating people food, or getting into the garbage)
"
"Sudden changes in diet
"
"Parasites
"
"Foreign materials
"
"Infectious agents, such as bacteria
"
"Parasites (e.g., giardia or whipworms)
"
"Food hypersensitivity
"
"Infectious agents, such as bacteria (e.g., campylobacter, salmonella, or clostridium) or a fungal infection like histoplasmosis
"
"Foreign materials
"
"Cancer
"
"Inflammatory bowel disease
"
"Dysbiosis (leaky gut)
"
"Idiopathic (when your vet is unable to define a specific cause)
"
"Any dog can get colitis. However, young Boxers and French Bulldogs are more prone to a rare type of colitis called granulomatous colitis.
"
"In granulomatous colitis, a bowel segment becomes thickened or partially blocked due to a bacterial invasion of the intestinal wall. It results in bloody diarrhea and weight loss. Treatment includes antibiotic therapy and dietary changes as well as corticosteroids.
"
"These are the steps a vet will take to diagnose colitis in dogs.
"
"Vets will start by getting a thorough history (asking you questions about the issue). This information helps your veterinarian to determine if the diarrhea is from the small intestine or from the large intestine.
"
"Questions your vet might ask include:
"
"How long ago did this start?
"
"What does your dog’s stool look like? Is there blood or mucus in it?
"
"Is your dog able to hold it to go outside, or do they have to go urgently?
"
"Is your dog straining to defecate?
"
"Is there any vomiting, fatigue, or lack of appetite?
"
"Has your dog eaten anything recently that they typically don’t eat, or have they gone through a stressful event? Have you changed your dog’s diet?
"
"Next, your vet will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, including rectal evaluation. They will assess your dog’s dehydration level, check for pain or abnormalities in the abdomen and rectum, and assess the quality of their stool.
"
"In cases of both acute and chronic colitis, your vet will do a fecal analysis to determine if there are parasites. If you are taking your dog to the veterinarian for diarrhea, make sure to bring a fresh fecal sample in a sealed bag.
"
"Your veterinarian might diagnose acute colitis just based on the medical history, physical exam, and fecal analysis. However, the exact cause is often unknown since acute colitis usually clears up quickly on its own.
"
"If the diarrhea persists for longer than two weeks, it is classified as chronic diarrhea and requires further medical attention. Typically, this consists of a course of antibiotics followed by a diet trial.
"
"Before pursuing advanced diagnostics, your vet will usually recommend a diet trial for your dog. The recommended prescription diets are low in fat, high in fiber, and formulated either for a sensitive gastrointestinal tract or with a novel protein to determine if there are any food allergies.
"
"If the diarrhea does not respond to a special diet, the next step is an abdominal ultrasound. This examines your dog’s intestines for any signs of foreign material, thickening of the intestinal wall, or enlarged lymph nodes. The ultrasound surveys the abdomen for any clue as to what might be causing the diarrhea.
"
"The last step in colitis diagnosis is a colonoscopy. For a colonoscopy, your dog is put under general anesthesia, and a camera is inserted into their rectum and moved along the colon. Your veterinarian will look for any masses, signs of inflammation, or abnormalities. They will then take biopsies of the colonic wall to submit for further analysis.
"
"Do not give any medications at home. Dogs do not metabolize medications the same as humans, so giving your dog a human medication is very dangerous. It can also be counterproductive without knowing the exact cause of the colitis.
"
"Take your dog to the veterinarian if you see any symptoms of colitis. They might initially provide some fluids under your dog’s skin to help with hydration. Then, depending on their findings, they may prescribe one or more of the following treatment options.
"
"Metronidazole, tylosin, and sulfasalazine are antibiotics that might also have some anti-inflammatory properties. Courses of these are often tried in the beginning to help resolve colitis, and if it does not improve, then your dog will undergo a diet trial and further diagnostics.
"
"Supplementing the diet with fiber improves diarrhea in many animals. It reduces water in their feces, prolongs transit time (allowing more water to absorb), increases the fecal bulk, and improves the intestine’s ability to contract. You can add fiber through a prescription fiber diet, canned pumpkin, or psyllium.
"
"A bland diet consists of a simple protein, like boiled chicken (no skin, no spices), cooked hamburger, or fully cooked eggs, as well as a simple carbohydrate, like white or brown rice or white or sweet potatoes. You can even add a small amount of plain, canned 100% pumpkin for fiber (make sure there are no other ingredients).
"
"Prebiotics act as food for the beneficial bacteria in the colon. They help maintain a healthy bacterial population in the colon, which, in turn, helps resolve diarrhea in dogs.
"
"Probiotics are a protected culture of live bacteria that can help colonize the gastrointestinal system and promote beneficial bacterial balance. This also helps relieve diarrhea.
"
"Your dog may be prescribed a novel-protein diet or a hydrolyzed-protein diet in the case of food allergies. Otherwise, high-fiber diets might help in certain cases of colitis.
"
"Your vet may prescribe glucocorticoids for their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties when previous therapy has failed to alleviate your dog’s chronic colitis.
"
"They are used mostly with inflammatory bowel disease, which is diagnosed with a biopsy sample during a colonoscopy. If your dog requires a glucocorticoid to manage their diarrhea, they often have to stay on it long-term.
"
"In cases of acute colitis, full recovery typically happens within a few days. Chronic colitis usually takes a longer time, requiring further diagnostics and trials of different medications and diets to see what helps.
"
"Depending on the underlying cause, chronic colitis in dogs might not be curable, but it can often be managed and controlled through one or more of the following: diet, fiber supplements, antibiotics, and corticosteroids/anti-inflammatories/immune modulators.
"
"Acute colitis often clears up on its own within 24-48 hours. However, it does sometimes require veterinary assistance to fully resolve. Chronic colitis has many potential causes. Some can be treated, curing the colitis, but others can only be managed with medication or diet.
"
"Because many other conditions can have the same symptoms, and because it may be chronic colitis, you should go to the vet if you see:
"
"Urgency in needing to go to the bathroom
"
"Soft or liquid stool
"
"Straining or pain with defecation
"
"More frequent bowel movements of smaller volume
"
"Stool containing blood or mucus
"
"Stressful events, such as boarding, traveling, or moving, can trigger an episode of colitis. Eating something that upsets the gastrointestinal tract is another cause. There are many possible triggers, so seek veterinary evaluation if the diarrhea continues beyond 24 hours.
"
"As long as the dog still has energy and is eating, you can try a bland diet at home. Consider adding in some pumpkin for fiber as well as probiotics to help with the gut flora.
"
"It depends on the cause and severity. The costs would include the examination, fecal analysis, sometimes blood work to assess hydration, fluids (if given), and medications. In severe cases, where the dog needs to stay at the hospital or requires advanced diagnostics, such as an ultrasound or a colonoscopy, the cost is quite a bit higher.
"
"Yes. Stress is thought to be a common cause of colitis in dogs.
"
"Special diets, fiber supplements, probiotics, antibiotics, and steroids can all be used for colitis depending on the severity, duration of symptoms, and underlying cause.

"People often use over-the-counter cold and flu medications when they’re not feeling well, to help with congestion, fever, coughing, sneezing, pain, and various other symptoms. While some of these medications can be given to dogs for certain conditions, do so only after consulting with your veterinarian.
"
"Some cold and flu medications have more than one active ingredient, which can make them dangerous for your dog.
"
"If you suspect your dog has swallowed any cold or flu medication, please contact your veterinarian, an emergency hospital, and/or pet poison helpline as soon as possible.
"
"Human cold and flu medications, both over-the-counter and prescription, contain ingredients that can be deadly to pets. These medications can affect many parts of a dog’s body. While the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels) and central nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and associated nerves) are the most affected, the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, intestines, colon), kidneys, and liver can be involved as well.

"If your dog ingests any cold and flu medication, or you suspect they may have, do not wait for your dog to have symptoms, since time is of the essence. It’s best to bring your dog to your vet’s office or an emergency hospital as soon as possible. Calling the pet poison helpline is recommended as well. They can help to guide the treatment process with you and your veterinarian.
"
"Vitamin C and echinacea are the least toxic vitamins or natural medications that are sometimes given to dogs, but they can cause mild stomach upset. However, zinc is highly toxic to dogs at large doses and will cause a dog’s body to destroy its own red blood cells, leading to a possibly life-threatening anemia.
"
"Most multivitamins also contain iron, which can be toxic to dogs and cause burning and irritation to the lining of the mouth and the gastrointestinal system. In large amounts, supplemental iron can also cause liver failure in dogs.
"
"If you suspect your dog has ingested cold and flu medication or is showing signs of medication toxicity, contact your veterinarian, an emergency hospital, and/or pet poison control as soon as possible.
"
"It is never recommended to make your dog vomit at home. All induced vomiting should be done with the guidance of a veterinarian or veterinary staff. If induced vomiting is done at home it can cause life-threatening conditions, such as aspiration pneumonia or chemical burns to the digestive system.
"
"It is very important that you provide as much information to the veterinarian as possible, including:
"
"Name of medication
"
"Milligram dose of each tablet/capsule/liquid
"
"Approximately how much medication is missing/suspected to be ingested
"
"Time of possible ingestion
"
"It’s best to overestimate how much medication your dog may have ingested to determine worst-case scenarios.
"
"Poisoning cases can be scary, but treatment is available—and the sooner it is started, the better. Your veterinarian may choose to induce vomiting in your dog if the toxin was recently ingested and the dog is not yet showing signs of toxicity.
"
"If your dog has ingested a large amount of cold and flu medication, your vet might insert a stomach tube to flush out your dog’s stomach with water. They can also administer activated charcoal to deter the medication from absorbing into the bloodstream, which causes further toxicity.
"
"Treatment of cold and flu medication toxicity is aimed at correcting symptoms and providing supportive care, since there are no specific antidotes to these medications. It is important that dogs in this condition be kept warm and quiet and are closely monitored, to make sure they remain responsive and their breathing is normal. This likely means your dog will have to stay overnight in the hospital.
"
"IV fluids will be administered to keep your dog hydrated and keep the kidneys functioning normally. Antinausea medications and liver protectants may also be used to help your dog recover from this toxicity. If anemia develops, a blood transfusion will likely be needed.
"
"Good medication practices include keeping all original packaging until the medication is gone, in case the information is needed. Also, when repackaging medications, such as adding them to a pill organizer or other non-medicinal container, use extreme caution. It may seem convenient to put a plastic bag with some Tylenol, vitamins, and a few cold tablets in your purse or pocket, but think of the potential complications if your dog eats the entire contents.
"
"Never give your dog human medication unless you have consulted and approved its use with your veterinarian. Do not leave pills on the counter or the bottles within reach of your dog. If you drop any medication, pick it up immediately so your dog cannot eat it.

"Labrador retrievers are one of the more active dog breeds. Part of having a Lab in your family is to become accustomed to having a high energy dog that plays and exercises a lot. Most dogs will slow down or stop when they are tired and will have no problems, but some revel so much in activity that they will exercise until they become weak and collapse from exhaustion. This is called exercise induced collapse in Labrador retrievers. Problems usually occur during periods of intense activity or excitement. At other times, these dogs seem completely normal.
"
"Symptoms are first seen in young dogs between five months of age and three years of age. The disease does not seem to affect one gender more than the other. Labs bred to be field trial dogs may be more likely to have the problem, and Labs that are easily excited are more likely to have the problem. Collapse is most likely to occur when the temperature and humidity are high, and during activities like upland bird hunting, repetitive retrieving, long, hard running, and intense play, but any very intense activity can lead to collapse.
"
"Signs begin after five to twenty minutes of extreme exercise, excitement, or stress. They include:
"
"An inherited problem in Labrador retrievers that is an autosomal recessive trait. Dogs that carry two copies of the gene (homozygotes) are at substantial risk of showing clinical signs. Dogs that carry one copy of the gene (heterozygotes) are carriers and can pass the gene to their puppies. However, they are not likely to show symptoms of exercise induced collapse.
"
"A genetic test is available to identify the gene that causes exercise induced collapse in Labrador retrievers. If your veterinarian suspects this disease, the genetic test may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.
"
"Other testing your veterinarian may want to perform includes a complete blood count and biochemical profile. These will confirm that your dog's internal organs are working properly. Your dog's thyroid hormone level may also be checked to make sure it is normal. Other blood tests can be analyzed to see if other muscle diseases might be causing your dog to collapse. To make sure that your dog is not suffering from a heart problem that comes and goes, your veterinarian may want your dog to wear a special monitor for a day or two to track normal heart rhythm. These tests are typically normal in Labs with exercise induced collapse.
 
"
"
"
"Is your dog or puppy having diarrhea, but it smells almost like fungus, or not like normal diarrhea? Funny-smelling diarrhea can be a sign of a gastrointestinal issue in your dog known as coccidia.
"
"This guide will tell you everything you need to know about coccidia in dogs—from symptoms and causes to treatment and prevention.
"
"Coccidia, also known as canine Cystoisospora spp. (formerly Isospera), is a protozoan parasite that can infect the gastrointestinal tract of dogs.
"
"These tiny-celled parasites live in the wall of the intestine. Coccidia is most common in puppies but can also infect adult dogs as well as cats.
"
"Here are the most common signs of coccidia in dogs and puppies, and what you might see if a dog is severely infected.
"
"Diarrhea that’s watery or bloody or has mucus
"
"Weight loss
"
"Dehydration
"
"Not eating (anorexia)
"
"Vomiting
"
"Depression
"
"Death
"
"However, some dogs with coccidia can be asymptomatic and not show any signs of being infected. These infected dogs can still shed the egg-like structure in their feces and infect other dogs or puppies, so it’s important that your dog has a fecal exam at their annual and biannual vet visits.
"
"Clotting disorders in dogs are any type of disease that results in a dog’s blood not being able to clot properly. Blood clotting disorders, or coagulopathies, are a broad category and can be due to issues either with platelets or with the substances in blood known as clotting factors.
"
"Platelets are cell fragments in circulating blood. Platelets are the first responders to stop any type of bleeding and start clot formation. Clot formation, or the plugging of any tiny areas of tissue hemorrhage, occurs constantly in a dog’s body even if no major injury or trauma has occurred. A certain number of platelets are needed in order to be able to clot, and the platelets need to be healthy.
"
"A lack of platelets, known as thrombocytopenia, can cause problems with blood clotting. A thrombocytopathy occurs if platelets in the blood are not healthy enough to perform their function.
"
"There are two main types of thrombocytopathies:
"
"1) Hereditary thrombocytopathies: These are genetic and passed down from generation to generation in certain lines of dogs. 
"
"2) Acquired thrombocytopathies: These are rare and occur secondary to a toxin or infection.
"
"Clinical signs of thrombocytopathies in dogs include:
"
"Nosebleeds
"
"Bleeding from the gums or gingiva
"
"Most dogs with exercise induced collapse can be treated by avoiding the activities which cause it to collapse. Of course, exercise cannot be entirely avoided, so when your dog does exercise, all activity should be stopped at the first sign of weakness. Give your dog water to drink by mouth or spray it with cool water to help bring down the body temperature.
"
"If changing your dog’s activities is not possible or is not helping, there are other things which might help. Some dogs have fewer episodes of collapse when their diet is changed and they gain a small amount of weight. If the dog is not neutered, neutering may help.
"
"There are some medications that might helpful as well. Your veterinarian can help you to decide if one is right for your dog. Though medications will not help all dogs, in many dogs, medications may just decrease the number of episodes a dog has or minimize the severity of the episodes.
"
"Being observant of your dog's condition is the most practical ongoing treatment and prevention. When your dog shows symptoms of exhaustion and imminent collapse, it is important to stop all activity and cool your dog down. If your dog can be treated simply by changing its activity level, you may need to do this for the rest of its life. If your dog has been prescribed medication to help with its symptoms, you will need to return to your veterinarian for regular follow-up visits to make sure that the medicine is not hurting any of your dog's internal organs. Make sure to follow all of the instructions you are given with the medication carefully, making changes only after consulting with your veterinarian. Usually, the number of episodes that your pet has will decrease with age.
"
"It is important to avoid activities that will cause your dog to become weak to the point of collapse. Dogs that have been diagnosed with exercise induced collapse should not be used for breeding, as this is a hereditary condition.

"
"Dogs can get coccidia by ingesting the oocyst (immature coccidia) from a contaminated environment, such as soil or feces that contains coccidia.
"
"Young puppies are more likely to become infected with coccidia when they are exposed to contaminated dog feces due to their underdeveloped immune system. This is why it is so important for puppies to have multiple fecal exams throughout their puppy visits with their veterinarian.
"
"Stressful situations (traveling or moving to a new home environment), immunosuppression, or additional chronic diseases can make dogs more susceptible to coccidia infection.
"
"Coccidia is typically host-specific, meaning that dogs cannot be infected from the feces of another species (e.g., sheep, rabbits, or cats).
"
"However, dogs may become infected through predatory behaviors when another species is ingested.
"
"Dogs cannot pass coccidia to cats, even if a cat is exposed to the feces of a dog with coccidia. Coccidia in cats is caused by a different host-specific coccidia parasite.
"
"Coccidia is not a zoonotic disease, which means that humans cannot contract coccidia from a dog.
"
"The treatment for coccidia in dogs is pretty straightforward—eliminate the parasite.
"
"The only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for coccidia is sulfadimethoxine, which must be prescribed by a veterinarian.
"
"There are other drugs that are used with some success in the treatment of coccidia, such as ponazuril, which has shown to be effective from the most current published research.
"
"Metronidazole can help treat the diarrhea that is caused by coccidia, but it does not rid the body of the protozoan parasite.
"
"If your dog or puppy is infected with coccidia, administer the medications prescribed by your veterinarian and do not take your dog to areas like dog parks, boarding centers, and areas with high populations of dogs.
"
"Coccidia can remain infective in the environment for several months.
"
"You must thoroughly clean up your dog’s feces, and also clean the ground. This will help prevent other dogs from being exposed AND prevent your dog from being reinfected.
"
"Clean up as much of the feces as you can with a bag and paper towels. You can then use an antibacterial spray or bleach to kill any remaining bacteria.
"
"Fecal exams by a veterinarian are the best way to check for coccidia. These should be done at your dog’s yearly visit or if they are showing clinical signs, especially diarrhea.
"
"Try to avoid environments with dogs or puppies that are currently infected with coccidia. If your dog is a puppy, avoid high-risk areas like dog parks.

"Bleeding excessively from cuts or wounds
"
"Causes of of inherited thrombocytopathies, including the breed or breeds where the cause is commonly diagnosed include:
"
"Von Willebrand disease (vWD): Doberman Pinscher
"
"Canine Scott syndrome (CSS): German Shepherd
"
"Bleeding occurs after injury–platelets can form normally but cannot organize into a clot.
"
"CalDAG-GEFI deficiency: Basset Hound, Spitz
"
"Bleeding occurs after injury and a dog’s platelets are unable to form normally.
"
"Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia: Otterhound, Great Pyrenees
"
"Bleeding occurs because the platelets do not have enough of a certain protein required for them to bridge together and form a clot.
"
"P2Y12 receptor mutation: Greater Swiss Mountain Dog
"
"Dogs carrying this mutation are unable to aggregate their platelets.
"
"Causes of acquired thrombocytopathies include:
"
"Aspirin toxicity
"
"Rare complications from infections such as leptospirosis, ehrlichiosis
"
"Complications from severe liver or kidney disease
"
"A variety of tests are used for the diagnosis of thrombocytopathies in dogs including:
"
"A complete blood count (CBC) calculates the numbers of the types of blood cells circulating in the blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. 
"
"Manual platelet count and cytology checks for the number of platelets, evaluates their size and shape and if they are aggregating (clumping together).
"
"A chemistry panel evaluates liver, kidney, blood-sugar, and protein levels in the bloodstream, to diagnose the health of the organs.
"
"Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) tests measure how quickly the blood clots and checks to make sure that other parts of the clotting system, not related to platelets, are functioning.
"
"The buccal mucosa bleeding time (BMBT) test directly checks how quickly the platelets can stop bleeding. A precise, superficial cut is made on the dog’s gum and the response is carefully measured.
"
"Von Willebrand factor assay checks for von Willebrand deficiency in dogs that are at risk for having inherited this disease.
"
"Genetic testing to determine carriers of inherited traits can be performed so that dogs known to have a propensity to develop the disease are not bred.
"
"Treatment of thrombocytopathies in dogs varies, depending on the type and require a veterinarian. 
"
"Inherited thrombocytopathies: For dogs with the inherited clotting disorder, surgery should be avoided. If trauma or an unavoidable surgery occurs, these dogs may be treated with cryoprecipitate (plasma-derived blood product) transfusions or injections of the medication desmopressin. These treatments are designed to stop bleeding in the short term. There is no permanent cure for thrombocytopathies at this time.

"Acquired thrombocytopathies: For these dogs, the underlying cause must be treated.
"
"In cases of thrombocytopathies causing severe bleeding, transfusions of red blood cells or platelets may be needed.
"
"Successful management of this condition depends greatly on the underlying cause, and the individual pet’s response to therapies. Your veterinarian will work with you to determine the best treatment plan based on your dog’s medical history.
"
"Spontaneous bleeding is possible at any time with an active thrombocytopathy. If bleeding occurs in your dog, keep it as quiet as possible and avoid any rigorous exercise or play. Crate rest is recommended and, for some dogs, sedatives may be helpful. Monitor your pet for any signs of bleeding, especially around the nose or mouth. Check for any areas where small bruises may be forming. The easiest areas to see bruising are on the inside of the ear flap and on your dog’s abdomen, where the hair is more sparse.
"
"If your pet gets a wound or cut, keep him as calm as possible and apply gentle pressure for 4 to 5 minutes and contact a veterinarian. If bleeding from the nose or mouth does not stop after 10 minutes, contact a veterinarian.

"The liver is the primary site of synthesis of coagulation, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic proteins. In fact, only five blood clotting factors are not produced there. Therefore, liver diseases that cause clotting issues in dogs can be very serious and sometimes life-threatening.
"
"The causes of coagulopathy of liver disease are abundant, including:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC), and electrolyte panel.
"
"Hemostatic tests like prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), activated clotting time (ACT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin clotting time (TCT), and Proteins invoked by Vitamin K Absence (PIVKA) are useful for measuring the severity of the dog’s inability to clot normally.  Tests can also be performed to detect low coagulation/anticoagulant factor (antithrombin (AT) and protein (C) activity. X-rays, meanwhile, are used to identify liver abnormalities, fluid in the abdomen, abnormal intestinal motility and thickening in affected areas.
"
"  
"
"
"
"In many cases, invasive procedures are unnecessary unless there is severe hemorrhaging. Fresh whole blood, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate or platelet-rich plasma are viable options to treat hemostatic disorders.
"
"However, if the dog has fluid buildup in the abdomen, a sample should be taken to determine if it is due to a hemorrhage or ascites. This must be done with extreme care to avoid exacerbating the problem.
"
"A vitamin-rich, well-balanced diet is vital for a quick recovery. Deworming your pet of parasites can also help prevent future intestinal bleeding.

"Coagulation takes place when blood transforms from a free flowing liquid into a thickened gel like state. In this state the gelled blood is called a clot, and it is through clotting that a wound begins to seal. This process is critically important for healing to take place. When your dog is injured and continues to bleed uncontrollably, this may be symptomatic of a defect in one or more of the processes that bring about coagulation. A complex series of enzyme reactions are involved in turning blood from a fluid to a gel. A failure in one of these processes can cause prolonged hemorrhaging after an injury, and will result ultimately in blood loss anemia. The failure of blood to coagulate can also result in internal hemorrhaging. Knowing the symptoms to watch for is crucial.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Symptoms of coagulation factor deficiency can include prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma, an obvious external symptom. Some of the less obvious symptoms that can be indicative of  a coagulation deficiency are related to blood loss anemia and internal bleeding. With blood loss anemia, symptoms can present as weakness, lethargy, short breath, irregular heart beat, confusion, and a condition known medically as pica -- a compulsive behavior that is often intended to balance a lack of minerals or vitamins in the blood, in this case, iron deficiency from loss of blood. Internal bleeding may present as bloody vomit or stools, bleeding from the rectum or vagina, difficulty breathing, abnormal heart rhythm, swollen or hard abdomen, and excessive thirst.
"
"Several factors can determine the probability that your pet is suffering from coagulation factor deficiency. An underlying disorder, such as vitamin K deficiency, can affect the functioning of the liver, one of the primary sites for synthesizing the enzymes necessary for coagulation. Other problems with the liver can also affect the process of enzyme synthesization. The underlying cause for coagulation deficiency can also be predisposed by hereditary traits. An example of this is Hemophilia. Both the A and B forms of hemophilia are x-linked recessive traits, where males bleed excessively and the females carry the trait and pass it on. Hemophilia is characterized by an abnormally low amount of the protein needed to bind blood platelets into a clot. This protein process is one of the coagulation factors that the body utilizes for clotting external and internal wounds. Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, and is not always inherited. It can also develop when the body forms antibodies that block the coagulation factor processes. Severe deficiency of coagulating factors will usually become apparent by four to six months of age. Milder deficiency may show up after an injury or after surgery.
"
"In addition, external environmental circumstances may play a role in the incidence of coagulation factor deficiency. Ingestion of rat poison, or a snake bite, can affect the body's ability to process enzymes and proteins normally. Medically prescribed medications can affect the blood's ability to clot as well. Long term use of antibiotics can cause complications, and the use of prescription Heparin as an anti-coagulant (used for breaking up blood clots in the veins) can result in an accidental overdose.
"
"Your veterinarian may first want to rule out external factors, such as access to rodent poison, or recent contact with a snake or a lizard. A complete blood test will be ordered, and an assay of the blood's ability to coagulate will be used to determine the source of the disorder. If your dog shows signs of increased red blood cells (RBC), an indication of regenerative anemia, it will signal the possibility of internal blood loss.
"
"
"
"If blood loss is severe, your dog will be hospitalized and will receive blood and plasma transfusions. In fact, repeated transfusions may be necessary to control or prevent further hemorrhaging. Your veterinarian will probably also prescribe vitamin K, especially if your dog has ingested rodent poison or is experiencing other conditions that deplete this vitamin.
"
"The blood will continue to be tested on an ongoing basis to determine the effectiveness of vitamin K supplementation. It should begin to normalize 24 to 48 hours after the beginning of therapy. The only way to test whether a hereditary deficiency has been treated successfully is by factor analysis; whether the hematomas (collections of clotted blood) have been resolved, and most importantly, whether the bleeding has stopped. Transfusion sometimes causes immune reactions when antibodies resist the new blood. If transfusion is a decided treatment, your pet will need to be monitored for symptoms of rejection.
"
"There is no particular breed that is more susceptible than another, so there is nothing that can be done to prevent it unless it is known to be in the genetic makeup of a breeding dog. If it is determined that a hereditary factor is responsible for the coagulation factor deficiency, it is best not to breed this dog.

"The palate is the roof of your dog’s mouth. A cleft palate is an opening along the middle of the palate. This opening can range from small (a few millimeters) to severe (the entire length of the hard and soft palate). This results in a lack of tissue connection between the mouth and nasal passages, creating problems for the dog that include eating, difficulty nursing, and poor growth.
"
" 
"
"Symptoms of a cleft palate in dogs can be easy to notice and even visible. Cleft palate in dogs can also create various health issues due to its structure. These symptoms can include: 
"
"Difficulty nursing: Puppies with a cleft palate are unable to create enough suction when nursing because the oral cavity is open to the nasal cavity. The milk or food the dog does manage to get travels from the mouth to the nose, causing sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal irritation (also known as rhinitis), regurgitation, and gagging. 
"
"Poor growth: Without the ability to nurse and eat normally, many puppies and dogs with cleft palate do not get proper nutrition and can be lethargic, with a poor rate of growth. 
"
"Aspiration pneumonia: Breathing in food and water can cause an infection of the lungs. Depending on your dog’s age, this may result in a cough and a fever, then develop into lethargy, difficulty breathing, and possibly death.  
"
"Facial deformity: Occasionally, dogs with cleft palate will also have a facial deformity, such as cleft lip. 
"
"Other issues: Though they are not always apparent at first, and depend on the cause of the cleft palate, problems with the inner ear, middle ear, swallowing apparatus, nasal septum, sinuses, and teeth may develop. 
"
"There are two types of cleft palate in dogs: 
"
"Congenital cleft palate is present at birth if the palate fails to fuse properly during days 25-28 of gestation. This can occur for a variety of reasons: 
"
"Nutrition: Cleft palates can occur with too much dietary vitamin A or a lack of folic acid during pregnancy. 
"
"Medications: Most notably, steroids, aspirin, griseofulvin, and some anti-seizure medications during pregnancy can cause cleft palate in puppies. 
"
"Viruses: If the mother is exposed to certain viruses at a specific time during pregnancy, her puppies may be born with cleft palate. 
"
"Acquired cleft palate is a new defect that appears in a previously normal palate. Causes may include: 
"
"Trauma, such as gunshot injuries, bite wounds, thermal/electric burns, or blunt-force trauma 
"
"Periodontal disease 
"
"Foreign bodies in the mouth 
"
"Cancer 
"
"Purebred dogs, especially brachycephalic breeds (dogs that have short muzzles and flat faces), are more likely to have a cleft palate. Some common brachycephalic breeds predisposed to cleft palates include Boston terriers, Pekingese, Boxers, and Bulldogs. Other breeds that may have congenital cleft palate include:  
"
"Miniature schnauzers  
"
"Beagles 
"
"Cocker spaniels 
"
"Dachshunds 
"
"Brittany spaniels 
"
"Shih tzus 
"
"Great Pyrenees 
"
"Nova Scotia duck tolling retrievers 
"
"While there may be a genetic link in some of these breeds, there are other causes, and cleft palate can happen to both purebred and non-purebred dogs. 
"
"Most commonly, veterinarians diagnose a cleft palate based on a physical exam, especially in newborn puppies. Older animals may need to be sedated for the exam, which involves a thorough oral inspection, looking for communication between the nasal and oral cavity. 
"
"Other abnormalities will be evaluated at this point, paying special attention to the lungs for signs of pneumonia or infection. Your vet may use radiographs to check for abnormalities of the skull, nasal sinuses, membranes, and oral and nasal cavities, as well problems with the inner and middle ear and the teeth. 
"
"Vets may use additional imaging techniques, such as MRI and CT. Biopsy and histopathology can be used in cases of acquired cleft palate caused by infections or tumors.
"
"Most cases of congenital and acquired cleft palate require surgical correction by board-certified veterinary dentists and surgeons. A small number of acquired clefts may be able to heal on their own. 
"
"Most dogs with cleft palate will require numerous surgeries, but the first is the most important because scar tissue can affect future surgeries. There are a variety of techniques surgeons use depending on the size, location (hard vs. soft palate), and severity of the cleft.  
"
"The goal of surgery is to re-establish separate oral and nasal cavities and to reconstruct the nasal cavity floor. This is most commonly done using a ￼flap technique, which involves relocating existing, healthy tissue in the mouth to cover the deformity.  Less common surgical strategies include: 
"
"Stem cells 
"
"Bone grafts 
"
"Prostheses 
"
"Platelet-rich plasma injected at the surgical site 
"
"Newborn puppies with cleft palate commonly require tube-feeding before they are old enough for surgery, usually past 8-12 weeks. This will decrease the chance of aspiration pneumonia and ensure that the puppy receives adequate nutrition. Older dogs should eat small, meatball-sized dog food to decrease the chances of preoperative aspiration pneumonia.  
"
"All active infections must be treated before surgery. Dogs with chronic rhinitis or pneumonia may require oral or IV antibiotics before and after surgery. Proper pain medications will also be prescribed in the postoperative period. 
"
"Dehiscence—the surgical site breaking down—is a common postsurgical complication. Many surgical sites break open due to tension at the surgery site, lack of space in the mouth, trauma during surgery, and trauma after surgery from eating or chewing. Hard food and chew toys must be avoided for a few weeks after surgery to allow proper wound healing. Dogs should be fed a diet with a thick liquid consistency during this time. Postoperative rechecks should be scheduled with the surgeon, typically at 2 - 4 week intervals. 
"
"Dogs that suffer from chronic rhinitis may still have flare-ups and require medications to manage the condition, even after surgery. However, with a successful surgery and a healed palate, the prognosis for these dogs is positive.
"
"A puppy with cleft palate can survive. However, such puppies may have many medical conditions to monitor and treat. Multiple surgeries will likely be required, and the process can be long, difficult, and emotionally challenging.
"
"Some types of cleft palates are congenital (present at birth) and have genetic causes.
"
"Small acquired cleft palates (such as those caused by foreign objects in the mouth, infection, or dental issues) can sometimes heal on their own; however, this is rare. Most cleft palates require surgical correction.
"
"Untreated cleft palate can lead to serious and potentially fatal medical conditions, such as chronic rhinitis, infection, lethargy, aspiration pneumonia, and even death.
"
"Repairing a cleft palate requires multiple surgeries by specialized board-certified veterinary dentists and surgeons. Each surgery and post-op hospitalization can range from $5,000 to $10,000 or more. Pet insurance may help you recover some of the costs of this expensive condition. Chat with your veterinarian to determine what makes sense based on your pet’s diagnosis.

"Cirrhosis of the liver is the generalized (diffuse) formation of scar tissue, associated with regenerative nodules, or masses, and deranged liver architecture. Fibrosis of the liver, on the other hand, involves the formation of scar tissue that replaces normal liver tissue. This condition can be inherited or acquired. Doberman pinschers, cocker spaniels, and Labrador retrievers are especially susceptible to long-term (chronic) inflammation of the liver; a condition known as chronic hepatitis.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to rule out other causes of disease are also standard examination procedures.
"
"A fine needle aspirate should be taken from the liver for a sample to be sent for cytologic analysis. A liver biopsy taken via laparoscope may also be necessary to form a definitive diagnosis.
"
"
"
"Patients with minimal signs can be treated on an outpatient basis as long as they are still eating normally. Patients with more severe signs should be hospitalized, given fluid therapy if necessary and have a feeding tube inserted if they are showing symptoms of anorexia. Electrolytes may be supplemented while administering fluids, and some patients respond well to B-complex vitamins.
"
"If there is abdominal fluid build-up, the fluid will need to be tapped and removed, and sodium restricted in the diet until the cause of the build-up has been resolved.
"
"Dogs displaying signs of hepatic encephalopathy (ammonia buildup in the blood causing neurologic signs) should have food withheld, as should dogs that are vomiting and/or suffering from inflammation of the pancreas. For hepatic encephalopathy, dogs may be given soy or dairy protein in combination with medical treatment to increase nitrogen tolerance. Such patients should have individualized protein portions suited to their level of hepatic dysfunction. Albumin levels should be maintained.
"
"If surgery is being considered in such patients, a clotting profile will be performed, sine patients with longer clotting times will have an increased chance of bleeding, even during minor surgeries.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule regular check-ups with you for your dog. At these visits, blood work will be done, including monitoring of total serum bile acids. Your veterinarian will also observe your dog's ongoing body condition and observe to see if fluid is building up in the abdomen. Contact your veterinarian if your dog's abdomen appears to be larger than normal, is behaving strangely, or seems to be losing weight.

"Chylothorax is a condition that results from the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the chest cavity where the heart and lungs reside (pleural cavity). The main culprit of this condition is chyle, a digestive fluid that is formed in the small intestine and conveyed by the thoracic duct to the veins. En route to the veins, chyle can leak into the chest cavity, accumulating there and causing excessive pressure on the chest and its organs.
"
"Chyle is a milky to slightly yellow fluid made up of lymph and fats from the intestines and transferred to the circulation through the thoracic duct (the main trunk of the lymphatic system, which crosses the chest near the spine and empties into the circulation system). Lymph is a watery fluid that is produced by the tissues of the body and which contains white blood cells, which are essential for protecting the body. Lymph travels through the lymphatic vessels, transporting lymphocytes (white cells that function specifically for cellular immunity) and fats from the small intestines to the blood stream. Commonly, when chyle has accumulated in the chest cavity, blockage or obstruction of the lymphatic vessels will occur, causing the vessels to dilate and affecting the tissue that covers the lungs and lines the inner chest cavity. This tissue becomes inflamed and scar tissue forms, narrowing the space and constricting the lungs. Severe breathing problems may result.
"
"The Afghan Hound and Shiba Inu breeds are most often affected by this disorder. Age does not seem to determine likelihood, however, in Afghan Hounds, it tends to develop when they are middle-aged, and in Shiba Inus younger than two years.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Symptoms can vary according to the underlying cause, how rapidly the fluid has accumulated, and the volume of fluid present. Struggling with breathing is the first sign of a problem, but if fluid has accumulated gradually, the condition may have existed before the appearance of breathing problems. There are several other attendant symptoms that can be taken into account when looking for the underlying cause of the breathing problem. Your dog may present some, or all, of these symptoms:
"
"The cause of chylothorax is usually unknown, but some of the instigators that have been found to cause it have been masses in the chest cavity (tumors), nodular lesions caused by a fungal infection, blood clots in veins, heart surgery, heart disease, and heartworm disease. There may also be a congenital element in the formation of this disease, and is suspected to be so for some breeds. But in general, the cause is usually classified as idiopathic (of unknown origin).
"
"Your veterinarian will need to draw some fluid from the chest. If chyle is found in the fluid, it will help your doctor to draw a firm conclusion as to the cause. Before fluid is withdrawn, your doctor may want to perform an ultrasound examination on the chest to check for masses in the internal chest cavity, and to check the heart and its structural condition to ensure that the correct diagnosis is made. X-ray imaging of the chest, before and after fluid has been removed, will present your veterinarian with a clear direction in which to progress. Further imaging may include a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan using a dye injection that will provide a visual point of reference as it travels through the system to reveal more accurately any blockages or obstructions.
"
" 
"
"Treatment will depend on the underlying cause, but a pleural tap to remove fluid from the chest cavity and improve breathing will be one of the primary actions.
"
"If the fluid has accumulated rapidly as the result of a trauma, chest tubes will be used to quickly relieve the pressure from the chest organs and prevent dilation of the lymphatic vessels. If accumulation of fluid continues, your veterinarian will need to continue the use of tubes to keep the chest clear, and will probably recommend surgery. The most common and effective surgical treatment is to bind the thoracic duct, and remove a part of the membranous sac that envelopes the heart. Continued use of chest tubes after surgery is likely until your doctor is confident that the chest cavity will remain clear on its own.

"
"Vomiting is one of the most common medical issues that affects dogs. It is technically defined as the forceful expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth.
"
"Vomiting is composed of three stages: nausea, retching, and vomiting. While vomiting can serve a protective function to eliminate potential toxins in dogs, it is usually a sign that something is wrong with your pet.
"
"Chronic vomiting refers to either continuous or intermittent vomiting for a period of at least 7 days. This is different from acute vomiting, or “regular” vomiting, which is a short-term problem. Sometimes a pet may vomit once, then return to normal and have no change in their energy or appetite. Chronic vomiting is a longer-term problem that may have different underlying causes. This can be a very frustrating condition to pet parents who are tired of cleaning up messes and are worried about their pet.
"
"A single bout of vomiting that is not accompanied by any lethargy or decreased appetite in a dog who is having normal bowel movements may resolve after a short fast and with a bland diet.
"
"If your dog is experiencing protracted vomiting (multiple bouts of vomiting) with lethargy and/or lack of appetite, it is considered a medical emergency.
"
"Vomiting is a clinical sign of an underlying problem or disease rather than a disease itself. Your dog may be experiencing chronic vomiting if they have vomiting episodes that occur for 7 or more days and/or repeated bouts of intermittent vomiting.
"
"Also, depending on the underlying cause, your veterinarian may prescribe medications for treatment, post-treatment, or maintenance.
"
"Ongoing care and maintenance will include periodic pleural taps to remove fluid from the chest cavity. Even if your dog recovers, you will want to have it evaluated from time to time for several years. Asking your veterinarian to do this during routine exams should be sufficient, unless your are advised to do otherwise. You will need to monitor your dog carefully for breathing problems or for the recurrence of attendant symptoms (see description of symptoms above). Chylothorax will sometimes resolve spontaneously, or after surgery, but for some dogs there is no effective treatment that will resolve it.

"
"One of the first steps in determining whether your dog is experiencing chronic vomiting is to rule out regurgitating. Vomiting and regurgitating can look alike but are very different conditions.  In both cases, processed food, stomach acid, and water can come up from the stomach and out of the mouth. Vomiting is associated with signs of nausea including:
"
"Drooling, increased salivating
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Lethargy
"
"Frequent swallowing
"
"Vomiting is an active process and requires some contraction of the abdominal muscles to expel the stomach contents. You will often see your dogs' sides heave as they work to vomit. Retching is a part of the vomiting process. Your dog will make noise as they open the throat to allow the vomit to come up.
"
"This is different from regurgitation, which is a passive process. When dogs regurgitate, they simply open their mouth and food and other stomach contents fall out. Regurgitation occurs right after a meal, whereas vomiting may be immediately after a meal or several hours later.
"
"There are many different possible causes of chronic vomiting in dogs. It is important to work with your veterinarian to determine which of the causes is more likely triggering chronic vomiting in your dog. The following is a list of some of the more frequent causes of chronic vomiting in dogs:
"
"Gastrointestinal sensitivity or intolerance, or “sensitive stomach”
"
"Food allergy 
"
"Frequent diet changes
"
"Stress
"
"Bilious Vomiting Syndrome
"
"Dietary indiscretions (i.e., repeatedly getting into the garbage)
"
"Gastric foreign bodies
"
"Parasites
"
"Toxins
"
"Infectious disease or underlying infection i.e.. an infection of the uterus (Pyometra)
"
"Underlying systemic diseases i.e. kidney, pancreatic, liver disease, or cancer
"
"Medication side effect
"
"Addison’s (a disease of the adrenal gland) or other endocrine disease like diabetic ketosis
"
"Stenotic pylorus
"
"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
"
"Gastric ulcers
"
"Younger dogs are more likely to experience gastrointestinal foreign bodies, parasites, and to have dietary indiscretions. Certain underlying genetic conditions like a stenotic pylorus or food allergy may be diagnosed in a dog’s early years. It is not uncommon however, for food allergies or intolerance to develop with time rather than be present at birth. Senior dogs are more commonly affected by systemic diseases like kidney disease and cancer.
"
"When a dog experiences chronic vomiting, a veterinarian will start with getting a thorough history. It is important to note any patterns seen at home (i.e.: Is vomiting more frequently observed at a certain time of day or after a meal?) Try to be as complete as possible and share any observations you’ve made regarding when the episodes occur and any other behaviors. Other helpful insights include type and brand of food, dog’s energy level and appetite, frequency of bowel movement, and what stool looks like. Stool samples are recommended.
"
"During the physical exam, your veterinarian will likely palpate your dog’s abdomen for any abnormalities and check over their entire body for possibly correlated issues. The next step is to pursue diagnostics. A fecal exam, x-rays, or blood work will likely be recommended. If these first-line tests do not provide any answers, your veterinarian may recommend advanced diagnostics like abdominal ultrasonography, endoscopy, CT, or an exploratory surgery and biopsies.
"
"Treatment varies dramatically, depending on the underlying problem. Sometimes diet therapy alone can manage chronic vomiting conditions. There are several prescription diets that are formulated specifically to manage dogs with sensitive GI tracts that benefit from prebiotics and highly digestible fiber-rich diets, like Hill’s Gastrointestinal Biome or Royal Canin Gastrointestinal High Fiber diet.
"
"Other diets are made to address food allergies, either with alternate protein sources, like egg or kangaroo, or by using hydrolyzed protein that has been broken down into small pieces to avoid triggering an allergic response. If your veterinarian prescribes a prescription diet for your dog, be sure to feed that food exclusively for 8-12 weeks. Do not give unapproved treats that may affect results of the diet trial. You won’t be able to tell if a diet trial is working if your dog is receiving additional food.
"
"Oral medications may be necessary to manage chronic vomiting. Parasites and other infectious diseases are usually managed with oral meds like dewormers or antibiotics. Ulcers may also be treated with medicines given by mouth that protect the lining of the GI tract. Bilious vomiting syndrome, where dogs vomit first thing in the morning, may be managed with over-the-counter antacids, or with lifestyle changes. Sometimes management may be as simple as feeding a late-night snack so that your dog’s stomach is not empty for a long period of time.
"
"Chronic kidney disease is a common cause of chronic vomiting in senior small breed dogs. It is often accompanied by increased drinking, peeing, and weight loss. Prescription diet food can dramatically increase a dog’s quality of life by reducing the workload of the kidneys, hence slowing the progression of the disease process. Other systemic underlying diseases like pancreatitis, liver disease, and diabetes may also benefit from nutritional prescription diets that are specially formulated to spare that organ system and avoid flare-ups of clinical disease.
"
"Certain diagnoses require surgical intervention, like gastric foreign bodies. Gastric foreign bodies are non-food items eaten by a dog. This may be a ball, sock, or pieces of a toy or bedding. Surgery may be considered to explore the gastrointestinal tract to look for any problems that may be causing the chronic vomiting.
"
"There are many things that a dog can eat that do not show up on x-rays. Sometimes these items may be stuck in the stomach and occasionally obstruct the outflow tract to the intestines, leading to bouts of vomiting. These items can be found on exploratory surgery. Even if an exploratory surgery does not yield any foreign body, biopsies can be taken to look for signs of underlying gastric or intestinal disease.
"
"Recovery from chronic vomiting varies, depending on the diagnosis. If the problem is managed with nutrition alone, then management requires due diligence to make sure your dog follows a strict prescribed diet. Talk to your veterinarian about which treats are acceptable, if any.
"
"If your dog’s vomiting was related to parasites, treatment may be curative. It’s important to keep your dog on a quality preventative product monthly to avoid reinfection. Many of the heartworm prevention products on the market today also prevent the most popular gastrointestinal parasites as well. Talk to your veterinarian about which product is recommended for your dog.
"
"Dogs have two kidneys, which are vital for maintaining life’s day-to-day processes. They have a variety of functions, the foremost of which is to filter and excrete toxins and waste from the body. Other tasks of the kidneys include regulating fluid, mineral, and electrolyte balance; conserving water and protein; maintaining blood pressure; and producing red blood cells. 
"
"Many causes are associated with progressive loss of kidney function, and unfortunately, once lost the damage is irreversible. As a result, unfiltered waste products and toxins build up in the bloodstream, leading to a generalized state of nausea and malaise. When left untreated or unmanaged, a dog’s quality of life suffers. Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to managing the disease and maintaining your dog’s comfort and well-being.
"
"CKD is a progressive disease that has often been present for some time before it is diagnosed. It is typically classified into four stages, based on laboratory values and clinical signs:
"
"Stage I: No clinical signs are seen.
"
"Stage II: Some clinical signs are seen.
"
"Stage III: Many clinical signs are seen, and pets often feel sick.
"
"Stage IV: The majority of clinical signs are seen, often as an emergency. The quality of life for the pet is poor. 
"
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD), renal insufficiency, and chronic renal failure (CRF) are different terms often used interchangeably to describe declining kidney health—where over time the kidneys become less efficient in their required tasks and the results are life-threatening.
"
"Dogs typically won’t experience any symptoms until the kidneys have lost about 75% of their functioning capacity. The higher the stage (meaning the greater the extent of kidney disease present), the more symptoms are exhibited.
"
"Chronic bronchitis, also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), occurs when the mucous membranes of the bronchi (the airways that transport oxygen from the trachea to the lungs) become inflamed. Typically, this leads to a chronic cough that lasts two months or longer -- a cough that is not attributable to other causes like heart failure, neoplasia, infections, or other respiratory diseases.
"
"Despite extensive diagnostic efforts by your veterinarian, the specific cause of the inflammation is rarely identified. In addition, toy and small dog breeds, such as the West Highland white terrier and cocker spaniel, are found to be more susceptible to COPD, although it is sometimes observed in larger breeds of dog, too.
"
"Other than a dry cough (a hallmark sign of COPD), other symptoms associated with the disease include:
"
"Chronic airway inflammation is initiated by a variety of causes.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically non-specific. In fact, COPD is rarely definitely diagnosed. In some dogs, however, polycythemia or eosinophila (allergic state in which an increased number of eosinophils concentrate in the blood) develops as a result of the disease.
"
"Chest X-rays are helpful in determining the severity of the disease and to evaluate the extent of lung involvement. Dogs with COPD may have thickened brochi or, in severe cases, collapsed lungs. Bronchoscopy, another important diagnostic tool, is used to visualize the inside of the airways and identify abnormalities such as tumors, inflammation, and bleeding. This is done by inserting an instrument (bronchoscope) into the airways, usually through the nose or mouth. The technique can also be used to collect deep lung tissue samples, which are then sent to a laboratory for detailed examination.
"
"Your veterinarian may also use echocardiography (ECHO) and electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate the heart and identify abnormalities such as heart enlargement or failure. This may even help the veterinarian rule out heartworm disease.
"
"
"
"Unless life-threatening symptoms develop, most dogs do not require hospitalization. Otherwise, your veterinarian will typically recommend medication and oxygen therapy to be administered at home. Corticosteroids and bronchodilators, for example, are commonly employed to reduce airway inflammation and dilate the airway passage to facilitate breathing, respectively. Antibiotics, meanwhile, are usually prescribed to dogs in case of lung infections.
"
"Unfortunately, there is no cure yet available for COPD, but, with proper management, some symptoms may be kept in check. For example, weight control, a balanced diet, and proper compliance with medication will control the severity and progression of the disease.
"
"Exercise is particularly important, as it helps clear the secretion present in the airways, thereby making it easier for the dog to breath. However, exercise must only be implemented gradually, as it can also cause excessive coughing. Additionally, a balanced diet will help keep the dog fit, thus improving its breathing, attitude and exercise tolerance.
"
"Watch for excessive coughing and call your veterinarian immediately if it persists, as it may lead to a spontaneous loss of consciousness (syncope).

"
"Chronic renal failure (CRF), renal insufficiency, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are all medical terms used to describe the same condition. It occurs when the kidneys are unable to perform their required tasks at the same level of efficiency as before.  
"
"Dogs have two kidneys located on either side of their abdomen, that play a vital role in filtering waste from the body. Additionally, the kidneys serve to regulate fluid, mineral, and electrolyte balance; conserve water and protein; and play an important role in maintaining blood pressure and red blood cell production by making a hormone called erythropoietin.  
"
"Dogs cannot survive without their kidneys, and unfortunately, kidney transplants are yet to be a viable solution. Dialysis (a treatment for failing kidneys including the removal of waste) is often expensive and is extremely rare in dogs. However, early diagnosis and intervention is key to help maintain your dog’s quality of life. 
"
"Once diagnosed, CRF is then classified into four different stages based on severity of clinical signs and laboratory values: 
"
"Stage I: Clinical signs usually not apparent  
"
"Stage II: Some clinical signs noted  
"
"Stage III: Many clinical signs noted, and pets often feel “sick” 
"
"Stage IV: Majority of clinical signs noted, pets often present as a crisis 
"
"Underlying systemic diseases may be managed with chronic oral medications or lifestyle changes. Follow the instructions set by your veterinarian and be sure to check in regularly with recheck visits to monitor your dog’s response to treatment and make any necessary adjustments.
"
"If surgery was required to treat your dog’s chronic vomiting due to an underlying foreign body or stenotic pylorus that was treated surgically, be sure to keep your pet calm and quiet in the postoperative two-week period while they are healing from surgery. Prevent any running, jumping, stairs, or other activities that put undue stress and tension on their healing incision. Your veterinarian may send your dog home with a prescription bland diet and oral medications after surgery. Give all prescribed medicines until they are gone and closely monitor all intake and output during the recovery period. Leash walking is often recommended so that all bowel movements can be observed after surgery. If at any time after surgery your dog becomes lethargic, won’t eat, or has continued vomiting, contact your veterinarian immediately.
"
"While some causes of chronic vomiting can be prevented — such as parasites, toxins, and dietary indiscretions — others are more likely due to genetics and cannot be avoided, only managed. Be sure your dog is being given all recommended regular parasite prevention products and minimize exposure to toxins and other temptations.
"
"If your dog likes to get in the trash, try getting a trash can with a lid and keeping it in a room behind closed doors. Avoid letting your dog mouth non-food items or chew on bones or toys without direct supervision. Feed a quality balanced diet and avoid frequent diet changes that can upset your dog's stomach. Your veterinarian is the best person to discuss your dog’s optimal nutrition with. They may refer you to a board-certified veterinary nutritionist if a homemade diet is recommended for a diet trial.
"
"While a single intermittent episode of vomiting may be something that can wait, it is important to get your dog in to see an emergency veterinarian if they are not able to keep any food or water down. With gastrointestinal foreign bodies, especially if they have moved into the intestines, time is critical.
"
"If your dog occasionally vomits but otherwise is bright, energetic and keeps most meals down, this may be a situation where you can wait and schedule an appointment with your veterinarian.  Remember, vomiting is a sign that something is wrong and should be investigated. However, if your dog is only having intermittent bouts of vomiting, it may be addressed during office hours for a full work-up with your veterinarian.

"Changes in urine output, usually increased
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Dehydration
"
"Increased thirst
"
"Muscle wasting
"

"Chronic renal failure by definition is a disease that occurs over a period of time; it is an ongoing, progressive, and irreversible process where, for some dogs, the cause remains unknown despite extensive testing.
"
"Often CKD develops after a serious kidney injury such as from a severe infection (e.g., leptospirosis, tick-borne disease, or pyelonephritis), heat stroke, envenomation (from a venomous bite or sting), or the ingestion of toxic substances like antifreeze, NSAIDs (ibuprofen), or certain antibiotics. CKD is also associated with certain types of immune-mediated diseases or cancer.
"
"Dogs breeds commonly prone to CKD include:
"
"Basenji
"
"Bernese Mountain Dog
"
"The term “chronic” in chronic renal failure means that the process has been ongoing, is progressive, and unfortunately, cannot be reversed. For some dogs, the disease could have occurred after a serious kidney injury such as from a severe infection (i.e., leptospirosis, pyelonephritis) or ingestion of a toxic substance such as anti-freeze, grapes, or raisins, and certain antibiotics.   
"
"For others, it could be inherited, such as with glomerular disease (a specific type of renal kidney disease) and amyloidosis (a rare organ disease) as seen in breeds like the Bernese Mountain Dog and Shar-pei.  
"
"For others, it could be attributed to underlying immune-mediated diseases, stroke-like events, or even from clotting disorders. In cases for newly diagnosed dogs the underlying cause will likely remain unknown.   
"
"Clinical signs are often related to the severity of the CRF stage, meaning there are additional and more severe signs noted with stages III and IV than there are with stages I and II. Dogs often exhibit symptoms including:  
"
"Increased thirst and urination 
"
"Intermittent vomiting 
"
"Dehydration  
"
"Oral ulcerations (sores in the mouth) 
"
"Foul breath 
"
"Weight loss 
"
"Decreased appetite  
"
"Some dogs may show muscle wasting and signs attributed to high blood pressure, such as vision loss and weakness.  
"
"CRF is often diagnosed based on routine blood work and a urinalysis looking specifically at kidney markers such as: 
"
"Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): A by-product of protein metabolism, higher values can often indicate kidney failure 
"
"Creatinine (CREA): Measures how well kidneys are filtering waste from blood 
"
"Phosphorous: Elevated phosphorus levels typically indicate kidney damage 
"
"Electrolytes (Sodium, potassium, chloride) 
"
"Calcium 
"
"Red blood cell count: A low red blood cell count may indicate kidney failure 
"
"Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA): An additional test to help determine if kidney disease is present; it can be used for early detection of kidney disease 
"
"Urine specific gravity: A marker of how diluted or concentrated the urine is. Usually the higher the number, the more concentrated the urine is and the greater ability of the kidney to conserve water.  
"
"Boxer
"
"Bull Terrier
"
"Cairn Terrier
"
"Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
"
"Cocker Spaniel
"
"English Cocker Spaniel
"
"Shar-Pei
"
"West Highland White Terrier
"
"A veterinarian will start with a physical exam, bloodwork, and a urinalysis to look specifically at kidney values such as:
"
"Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): higher values correlated with kidney failure
"
"Calcium
"
"Creatinine (CREA): indicator of the kidney’s ability to filter wastes from blood
"
"Electrolytes: sodium, potassium, chloride
"
"Phosphorous: higher phosphorus levels seen with CKD
"
"Red blood cell count: low red blood cell counts are often seen secondary to CKD
"
"Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA): an indicator used for early detection of kidney disease
"
"Urine specific gravity: determines the kidney’s concentrating ability; the more concentrated the urine is, the greater the ability of the kidneys to conserve water
"
"Your veterinarian may also recommend additional testing such as:
"
"A urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio to determine how much protein is lost in the urine (termed proteinuria)
"
"A urine culture, as dogs with CKD are more likely to acquire urinary tract infections
"
"A blood pressure evaluation, as dogs with CKD often have hypertension (high blood pressure)
"
"Radiographs or abdominal ultrasound to screen for kidney stones, tumors, or infarcts (areas of dead tissue)
"
"CKD is a manageable but incurable disease—since by the time dog is symptomatic, irreversible damage has already occurred. Recommendations based on the stage of CKD will be tailored to match your dog’s needs, with dogs in Stage III or IV warranting greater care and therapy than dogs in Stage I or II. Common therapies for CKD include medications, diet, and fluid therapy, along with treatment for any underlying condition or inciting factors.
"
"Medications such as Cerenia®, ondansetron, or omeprazole can help aid nausea, vomiting, and lack or loss of appetite. For some dogs with more extensive needs, a feeding tube may be placed. Additionally, appetite stimulants such as capromorelin and mirtazapine may be recommended.
"
"Most vets will prescribe dietary management with a balanced diet that is lower in protein, salt, and phosphorus and is alkalinized to help combat side effects associated with CKD. Recommended diets typically include:
"
"Royal Canin® Renal Support
"
"Your veterinarian will most likely recommend additional diagnostic testing, including: 
"
"A urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio to quantify how much protein is being lost in the urine 
"
"A urine culture, as dogs in CKD are more likely to acquire urinary tract infections 
"
"A blood pressure evaluation 
"
"Radiographs or abdominal ultrasound to screen for kidney stones or infarcts (areas of dead tissue)   
"
"Dogs with CRF are generally older and have other ongoing issues, such as arthritis or liver disease, and so the management of CRF can be challenging. However, CRF can be managed, mostly with the aid of medications, diet, and hydration.  
"
"Specific management is geared toward each stage of the disease, with each progressive stage recommendations built upon the previous stage recommendations. Any dog in any stage with an increase in either UPC (urine protein to creatinine ratio) or high blood pressure will most likely be treated with medication.  
"
"Throughout your dog’s life, any disease process or illness that could affect his hydration should be treated promptly with IV fluids. Other drugs will be prescribed based on the dog’s diagnosis since renal metabolism will be affected and can lead to overdosages and/or worsening of the kidney disease.   
"
"Additionally, for all stages, fresh water should always be available, drinking should be encouraged, and adequate nutrition should be given daily. Dogs diagnosed with CRF are most likely prescribed a kidney friendly diet, which may include feeding your dog a canned diet of wet food that contains additional water. 
"
"As chronic renal failure is not curable and often progressive (although the timeline is variable) in nature, dogs diagnosed early on will benefit from nutritional management and consistent veterinary attention, which may include more frequent check-ups and blood work.   
"
"Dogs in stages I and II may often be monitored for further progression of signs, and some may be given a prescription diet specifically geared to help the kidney, by limiting the amount of work they must do.   
"
"Many dogs can go on to have a decent quality of life for many months to years. Dogs in stages III and IV often require more medical and dietary assistance. If secondary anemia is present, erythropoietin injections can be given at the direction of your veterinarian.  
"
"Dietary supplements, and phosphorus binders (to treat high phosphorus levels) may also be given for low potassium. Anti-nausea and anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medications can also be prescribed for dogs with a poor appetite, vomiting, or nausea. Fluids given either intravenously or underneath the skin can help dehydration. Because of the severity of signs often seen in dogs with stage III and IV, and the amount of care and effort required to support these dogs, some may be humanely euthanized.  
"
"Left untreated, dogs in kidney failure will die, usually within a few days to a few weeks. Death is often preceded by loss of appetite, dehydration, weight loss, vomiting, and multi-organ failure.
"
"There is no cure for CRF. However, if CRF is caught early and managed correctly, most dogs that experience kidney disease can go on to live a relatively normal life with some changes and long-term management.
"
"While CRF is not reversible, early treatment can provide your pet with a happier, longer, and fuller life. Regular, semi-annual checkups are key to early diagnosis and treatment of the development of chronic renal disease.

"Fluid therapy is essential. Fluids will flush out toxic waste substances that the kidneys should be doing on a routine basis and restore hydration. They can be given intravenously in the hospital or subcutaneously (underneath the skin) at home. Your dog should have access to fresh water at all times—a water fountain can be an especially important item to add to your home.  
"
"CKD is a serious lifelong condition that requires ongoing care and monitoring as symptoms continue to develop. Dogs with CKD require more frequent veterinary visits and testing than others, and at all stages of CKD, quality of life should be assessed as symptoms change. Be sure to adhere to your veterinarian’s recheck guidelines and continue all medications and diet as recommended; many will be required for life. 
"
"Depending on the circumstances, certain measures can help keep your dog comfortable and offer a good quality of life for as long as possible. Similar treatment and medications to those outlined above also are applicable for long-term management of CKD in dogs, such as:
"
"Dietary supplements such as Azodyl™, a pre/probiotic, that can help decrease waste products not eliminated by the kidneys.
"
"Other supplements, such as aluminum hydroxide and Epakitin®are geared to aid with low potassium and high phosphorus.
"
"Anti-nausea and anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medications can be prescribed as needed for dogs who experience intermittent vomiting and lack of appetite. 
"
"Unfortunately, given the severity of symptoms often experienced by dogs with Stage III or IV and the extensive amount of care and effort they require, euthanasia may be the best option.
"
"CKD is progressive; however, it’s difficult to anticipate the degree and timing of the progression. Some dogs can live for years with proper veterinary care and management, while others may have to be euthanized shortly after diagnosis.
"
"The progression of CKD in dogs varies, taking weeks to years for symptoms to be noticeable. Once known, though, it is estimated that 75% loss of kidney function has already occurred, and the damage is irreversible. Depending on the underlying cause, some dogs will deteriorate much faster than others. Frequent checkups and routine veterinary visits can help detect CKD sooner, which will ensure your dog’s comfort and garner an overall better quality of life.

"A diagnosis of chronic gastritis generally applies to a dog that has been vomiting regularly over a long period of time, often vomiting once or twice per day for 7-14 days consistently.   
"
"Dogs with chronic gastritis typically have an underlying illness and may have symptoms beyond simple vomiting. The major distinction is the length of the condition, which generally distinguishes chronic gastritis from an upset stomach due to something the dog may have eaten. 
"
"There are four types of gastritis in dogs:  
"
"Acute gastritis: a form of gastritis where the stomach is suddenly irritated and inflamed. This type often resolves without medical intervention. 
"
"Atrophic gastritis: a rare, long-term, chronic condition in which the glands of the stomach are reduced in size or number. 
"
"Chronic hypertrophic gastritis: a thickening of some of the tissues within the stomach, typically also a long-term chronic condition. 
"
"Chronic eosinophilic gastritis: involving an abnormal number of a certain type of white blood cells in the tissues of the stomach. 
"
"Dogs with chronic gastritis will show a variety of symptoms, including the following: 
"
"Abdominal pain and cramping 
"
"Lethargy 
"
"Diarrhea 
"
"Bleeding from the intestinal tract (often seen as either black tarry stool or vomit that resembles coffee grounds) 
"
"Weakness 
"
"Fever 
"
"Weight loss 
"
"Poor hair coat 
"
"Dehydration 
"
"Electrolyte imbalance (which would cause weakness, imbalance) 
"
"Chronic gastritis is more commonly seen in cats than dogs. However, there are many reasons a dog may develop chronic gastritis: 
"
"Food or medication: chronic gastritis may be related to something the dog is eating on a regular basis, or due to a medication or supplement. 
"
"Illness: chronic gastritis can be related to other conditions, including systemic diseases (such as kidney or liver disease) or infections. 
"
"Immune disorder: although less common, atrophic gastritis develops secondary to an immune disorder. This is commonly seen in the Norwegian Lundehund breed. 
"
"Congenital disorder: the underlying cause for chronic hypertrophic gastritis is unknown, but it is thought to be a congenital disorder linked to release of histamines (biologically active substances found in the environment). Older, small-breed dogs are more prone to this condition, and it is more common in male dogs. 
"
"Food allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, parasites, and hypereosinophilic syndrome (a blood disorder): this type of chronic gastritis is most common in dogs under 5 years of age, and predisposed breeds are German shepherds, Rottweilers, and Shar-peis. 
"
"Most often, the diagnosis of chronic gastritis in dogs involves multiple stages and steps, and it is important to remember that the definitive diagnosis is often reached only after significant testing. 
"
"Your vet may want to begin with some lab tests, including blood work (usually a complete blood count and a biochemistry profile) and fecal testing. Often, at this stage, food and medical trials are recommended.  
"
"If the vomiting does not resolve, more advanced testing is often recommended, including endoscopy (passing a camera down the esophagus into the stomach and upper intestinal tract) and a biopsy.  
"
"These tests will give the vet a better view of what is happening at the level of the problem (usually the stomach) and to sample the tissue for more information. Occasionally, more diagnostics are required to reach a diagnosis.
"
"Treatment of chronic gastritis usually depends on the underlying cause. Typically, a special diet is used, which may involve a prescription product designed specifically for dogs with inflammation in their stomach. Occasionally, a homemade bland diet might be appropriate, but this should be used at the discretion of your veterinarian. 
"
"Most of the time, a medication will be prescribed to try to reduce the vomiting. This may include an antiemetic/antinausea medication and/or an acid reducer. Depending on the diagnosis, a different anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed.
"
"In some dogs, the treatments mentioned above may provide a cure, but other dogs will need lifelong therapy to control their symptoms.

"Diarrhea is one of the most common reasons pet parents take their dogs to the vet. Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency and/or looseness of stool. 
"
"Diarrhea is not a disease itself, but rather a sign of an underlying problem. When diarrhea occurs, food moves through the digestive tract faster than normal. The digestive tract absorbs fewer nutrients, electrolytes, and water. Sometimes diarrhea is urgent, and pets are unable to hold it, and accidents happen in the house. Other times, pets are able to hold it, but have loose or liquid stool instead of firm stool when they have bowel movements outside.
"
"Diarrhea often clears up on its own, but chronic diarrhea can lead to dehydration, lethargy and vomiting. 
"
"There are two types of diarrheas in dogs: 
"
"Acute diarrhea occurs suddenly and resolves either on its own, or with treatment. 
"
"Chronic diarrhea or chronic enteropathy (CE) occurs when dogs don’t respond to common treatments for diarrhea, or when they do respond to treatment initially, but the diarrhea continues to return. Diarrhea is considered chronic when it lasts more than two weeks. 
"
"Chronic diarrhea is rarely an emergency but can lead to dehydration and malnutrition, which may progress to systemic illness, organ shutdown and even death when not appropriately treated. If your dog vomits frequently, cannot keep down food, acts lethargic, weak or depressed, this may be an emergency and should be seen by a vet as soon as possible. 
"
"Health Tools
"
"There is no true prevention for chronic gastritis other than to feed your dog high-quality food, ensure your dog is appropriately dewormed, and maintain a consistent and healthy diet based on their needs. 
"
"Chronic gastritis, by definition, is vomiting regularly (usually daily) for at least 7-14 days. Most dogs with chronic gastritis do have a long-term problem with vomiting.
"
"Your vet will be able to advise you on the best food to feed your dog, once the cause of the chronic gastritis has been diagnosed. Most dogs will be treated with a prescription product, although some can be fed a homemade bland diet for a short period.
"
"If the condition is properly diagnosed and treated, most dogs with chronic gastritis have a normal life expectancy.
"
"Dogs generally do not experience “stress” like people do, but an anxious dog is more likely to experience gastric upsets—which could, with time, become a component of chronic gastritis. However, this is the exception rather than the rule.

"
"Chronic diarrhea can be frustrating for pet parents and uncomfortable for the pet. There are several different ways diarrhea can occur in dogs. It may occur because the body does not absorb nutrients appropriately, the intestines are inflamed, there are increased secretions, the intestinal walls are leaky, or the intestinal muscles are not functioning properly.  
"
"The most common causes of chronic diarrhea are: 
"
"Parasites 
"
"Food sensitivity or allergy 
"
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a condition where the intestines are inflamed (possibly due to an autoimmune disease). 
"
"Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, in which the body fails to produce enough enzymes to digest fats, proteins or carbohydrates. 
"
"Other underlying disease 
"
"Diarrhea is often classified into either small intestinal or large intestinal diarrhea. When a dog swallows food, it travels from the mouth down the esophagus to the stomach. From there it enters the small intestine, and finally the large intestine before being passed out as stool. 
"
"Both small and large intestinal issues can result in either acute or chronic diarrhea. 
"
"When pets have small intestinal diarrhea, diarrhea is usually large in volume, with a slight increase in frequency. It may be accompanied by vomiting and weight loss.  
"
"Large intestinal diarrhea tends to occur in relatively small amounts several times throughout the day (generally more than five times per day). It can be accompanied by bright red blood. 
"
"Sometimes diarrhea occurs secondary to causes not related to the intestinal tract. This is often seen with organ disease, like pancreatitis (where the pancreas is inflamed) or liver and kidney failure. 
"
"Some breeds, like Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers and Yorkshire Terriers are genetically predisposed to protein-losing enteropathy. Other breeds, like Boston Terriers and Boxers, can get intestinal lymphangiectasia and/or ulcerative colitis, leading to protein loss in the stool. These diseases can be picked up on screening bloodwork but are often confirmed with additional testing. Often, these conditions show similar symptoms to chronic diarrhea. 
"
"Chronic diarrhea is diagnosed when a pet does not respond to normal treatments for diarrhea and it persists for more than 2 weeks, or when they have recurring bouts of diarrhea that never completely resolve. 
"
"To identify the root cause of chronic diarrhea, veterinarians first must rule out any underlying conditions. Your vet will perform a complete physical exam and, depending on your dog’s medical history, will recommend tests to check for the following potential causes:
"
"Parasites: Your vet may run a fecal float test to check for parasites, one of the most common causes of both small and large intestinal diarrhea. Hookworms can reside in the small intestines, feeding on blood, and potentially resulting in anemia in affected pets. 
"
"Whipworms, on the other hand, live in the large intestines and cause chronic, watery diarrhea as they steal nutrients from their host. Additionally, some parasites, like giardia, are very easy to miss in fecal float tests.   
"
"In patients with chronic diarrhea, many veterinarians will treat pets for parasites to ensure they have eliminated that common cause. Fortunately, many heartworm preventatives will also prevent several of the intestinal parasites. 
"
"Diet: After a thorough physical exam, fecal tests, and deworming, many veterinarians will explore diet therapy next to identify any sensitivity to specific food ingredients. 
"
"There are several different diet therapy options. Some diets are specifically formulated to be bland and have added prebiotics and probiotics, while other diets are designed to be hypoallergenic. 
"
"In most patients, the protein source (meat) is usually the culprit for food allergies. Many hypoallergenic diets have a “novel protein,” or new protein source that your pet has likely never been exposed to, like kangaroo meat or venison. Other hypoallergenic diets have hydrolyzed proteins, which are proteins that are broken down so small that they do not bind in the same receptor so that the immune system doesn’t have the same reaction to the protein. 
"
"If your veterinarian recommends a diet trial, it is important that you follow the directions exactly. Your veterinarian may recommend testing your dog for food allergies. 
"
"Underlying disease: If a dog with chronic diarrhea does not respond to deworming or diet therapy, a vet will run more diagnostics. It’s important to make sure that your dog doesn’t have any underlying systemic diseases that are contributing to their chronic diarrhea. 
"
"To establish a baseline your veterinarian will likely recommend running blood work, a urinalysis, and x-rays of your dog’s abdomen. Depending on results from these tests, your vet may decide to investigate further. For example, if your dog has very low proteins, your veterinarian may decide to explore common causes of protein loss in dogs. 
"
"Chronic Enteropathy: Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD) is a condition where the gastrointestinal tract is chronically inflamed. Either the small intestine, large intestine or both can be affected. Dogs with IBD may have vomiting in addition to diarrhea. Many patients have decreased appetite and lose weight as well. Testing usually involves additional blood work sent out to an external laboratory.  
"
"Infectious disease: Contagious organisms, like bacteria and viruses, can cause chronic diarrhea. Your vet may recommend fecal PCR panels to screen for the more common offenders like clostridium. Some chronic diarrheas can be bacterial in nature due to persistent intestinal overgrowth of bacteria. These conditions may respond to long-term low dose antibiotic therapy. 
"
"Refractory diarrhea: Occasionally patients will have refractory diarrhea, which is chronic diarrhea that does not improve with treatment, and tests are not providing answers. These can be tricky cases requiring additional imaging (like ultrasonography) and potentially intestinal biopsies to determine the underlying cause. While uncommon, there are gastrointestinal cancers that can cause chronic diarrhea. 
"
"It is often recommended to switch to a bland diet if a dog develops acute diarrhea.
"
"The addition of probiotics, like Purina Fortiflora or Nutramax Proviable, can help establish normal, healthy bacterial flora in the gut for normal digestion. 
"
"Pay close attention to the frequency and consistency of your dog’s bowel movements and share with your doctor any changes along the way. In order to get to the underlying cause of chronic diarrhea in your dog, it’s importance to have a trusted relationship with your veterinarian and patience in understanding that the timeline to recovery may be longer than desired.

"The biliary system in dogs is made of ducts that collect and direct bile from the liver and the gall bladder which stores bile. Just like any other tissue in the body, the ducts, gall bladder, and the liver can become inflamed. Inflammation of the ducts and gall bladder is called cholangitis. Inflammation of the liver is called hepatitis. These conditions can occur independently or together in what is termed cholangiohepatitis.
"
"The following clinical signs may be present during cholangiohepatitis in dogs:
"
"Lethargy (decreased energy level)
"
"Decreased to absent appetite
"
"Dehydration
"
"Weight loss
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Jaundice (yellow pigmentation in the skin, whites of the eyes)
"
"Fever
"
"Distended, painful abdomen
"
"Cholangiohepatitis is more common in cats than dogs.
"
"Conditions that interrupt normal flow of bile through the liver and from the gall bladder, such as gall bladder stones (choleliths) and thickened bile material in the gall bladder (gall bladder mucocele), can predispose dogs to the development of cholangiohepatitis. Infection from intestinal bacteria into the biliary system or spread of bacteria to the biliary system via the bloodstream, can also result in cholangiohepatitis.
"
"Initially, your veterinarian will recommend performing a general lab panel (blood and urine tests). This panel will provide an overall check of the organ systems and, in the case of cholangiohepatitis, changes in the values associated with the liver. Abnormalities in the liver values on lab work are not specific for cholangiohepatitis, as other liver conditions can cause similar changes in the values. Therefore, your veterinarian will recommend imaging the liver using ultrasound.
"
"Liver size and the appearance of the liver tissue, gall bladder, and biliary ducts will be assessed. Fluid in the abdomen (ascites) can also be detected with ultrasound. 
"
"Combining lab work and ultrasound findings may result in a suspicion for cholangiohepatitis, but liver and gall bladder biopsy and culture to check for bacterial involvement are needed for a confirmed diagnosis of this condition.
"
"Liver biopsies and gall bladder bile collection can be obtained via ultrasound, guided needle aspiration, laparoscopy, or surgery. Ultrasound-guided needle biopsies/bile collection presents the greatest risk for leakage of bile into the abdomen, when compared to the other two biopsy methods. 
"
"Liver biopsies will be evaluated for the type of inflammation present and will determine if the inflammation involves only the biliary system or if the liver tissue adjacent to the biliary ducts is also affected. Liver tissue and bile samples will be collected and checked for bacteria, via culture. If bacteria are present, the type of bacteria will be identified and a determination will be made regarding the best antibiotic(s) to use for treatment.   
"
"If a dog has cholangiohepatitis due to impaired flow of bile, secondary to gall stones (choleliths) or a gall bladder mucocele, surgery is typically recommended to address the underlying problem. If a dog has a severely diseased gall bladder wall and bile leaks into the abdomen causing inflammation (bile peritonitis), surgical treatment is needed. A dog that is not responding to medications for cholangiohepatitis is also a surgical candidate.   
"
"Medical management will include antioxidant medication, such as S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and possibly Vitamin E, to help the liver. Ursodiol, may be prescribed to help improve bile flow. Antibiotics will be chosen based on culture/sensitivity results and treatment can extend from six to eight weeks—sometimes longer. Pain medication will be provided if a patient pet shows signs of abdominal discomfort. Sometimes anti-inflammatory medication, such as prednisolone/prednisone may be used depending on the case.
"
"Supportive care largely depends on the degree of illness. If a pet patient is vomiting, lethargic, develops jaundice, or runs a fever, hospitalization and IV fluid support is needed. Medications to help control nausea and pain will also be required. A severely ill pet may need special fluids or a plasma transfusion(s) if liver function is severely compromised. 
"
"Cholangiohepatitis can be cured with medical and/or surgical treatment.  However, the condition can be fatal if a patient is more severely affected (has a ruptured gall bladder or bile peritonitis).
"
"Treatment for cholangiohepatitis can extend up to eight weeks or longer. Depending on the degree to which the liver and gall bladder are affected, a patient may need to be on long-term medications such as SAMe, Vitamin E, or Ursodiol.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to monitor liver values, and possibly other parameters routinely, (possibly every two-to-four weeks—or more frequently for several months. At least yearly, if not more frequently, lab work checks will be recommended for life. 
"
"Recovery from cholangiohepatitis can take several weeks. If there is extensive damage to the biliary tract and liver, scar tissue may form, and a complete recovery will not be achieved. 
"
"Overall, the prognosis depends on the type of cholangiohepatitis present (based on biopsy) and the severity of illness. A dog that is treated sooner in the course of this illness will have a better prognosis than a dog with a more advanced progression of cholangiohepatitis. A dog with a ruptured gall bladder and bile peritonitis has a guarded-to-poor prognosis. 
"
"An annual examination, with yearly blood/urine testing, is potentially helpful in diagnosing this condition in its early stages. Even if a canine patient is not showing signs of illness, your veterinarian would note changes in liver values and recommend an abdominal ultrasound.

"In pectus excavatum, the sternum and costal cartilages are deformed, resulting in a horizontal narrowing of the chest, primarily on the posterior side. The sternum, or chest bone, is a long flat bone located in the center of the thorax, and the costal cartilages are the cartilages that connect the chest bone with the ends of the ribs. In appearance, the middle of the chest appear to be flat or concave, rather than slightly convex.
"
"Brachycephalic (short-nose) breed dogs are predisposed to this condition and in most cases are born with (congenital) this disability.
"
"There is a genetic predisposition in some dog breeds, particularly brachycephalic breeds, but pectus excavatum can occur spontaneously in any breed. The condition may not be obvious until several weeks after birth unless it is a severe form.
"
"Raising puppies on surfaces causing poor footing may also predispose these animals to developing such a condition.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, any information you have of its parentage and genetic background, and the onset of symptoms. Routine laboratory tests will include complete blood tests, biochemical profiles, and a urinalysis.
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct multiple X-rays of the thoracic cavity to confirm the diagnosis of pectus excavatum. These X-rays will reveal the actual deformities and related structural abnormalities. In some patients, the heart may be shifted from its normal place on the left side of the thoracic cavity due to the abnormal shape of the bones. Abnormalities and concurrent diseases related to the respiratory system will also be visible on X-rays. Echocardiography, a sonographic image of the heart, will be used to further evaluate the heart, its functioning ability, and possible cardiac defects.
"
"The normal concentration and regulation of urine normally depends on an elaborate interaction between antidiuretic hormone (ADH), the protein receptor for ADH on the renal tubule (the tube that plays a role in the filtering, reabsorption, and secretion of solutes in the bloodstream), and excessive tension of the tissue within the kidney. Hyposthenuria is a clinical condition in which the urine is chemically imbalanced. This may be due to trauma, abnormal hormone release, or excessive tension in the kidney.
"
"Abnormalities may also occur due to interference with the synthesis, release, or actions of ADH, damage to the renal tubule, and altered tension (tonicity) of the tissue within the kidney (medullary interstitium). There is no breed of dog that appears to be more or less affected by this condition.
"
" Symptoms will depend on the underlying cause of the disorder. Some of the more common ones include:
"
"Any disorder or drug that interferes with the release or action of ADH, damages the renal tubule, causes medullary washout, or causes a primary thirst disorder.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis, with emphasis on determining the urine specific gravity.
"
"The latter test reveals the functional capability of the kidney in its capacity to eliminate waste molecules without eliminating excess nutrients or water. These tests may confirm a urinary condition, with a low urine specific gravity of 1.000 to 1.006 g/ml, and excessive amounts of alkaline phosphates (ALP) in the blood serum, which would suggest hypoadrenocorticism or primary liver disease. High cholesterol is another common finding in dogs with hyperadrenocorticism.
"
"In dogs suffering from pyometra (a disease of the uterus) or pyelonephritis (urinary tract infection), leukocytosis, a type of white blood cell, will be raised and will be present in the urine sample, along with abnormal amounts of protein in the urine, a condition called proteinuria. Proteinuria is common in patients with pyelonephritis, pyometra, and hyperadrenocorticism. If an underlying condition of pyelonephritis is present, the urinalysis will also show inflammatory sediment or bacteria in the urine (bacteriuria). 
"
"Other laboratory tests your doctor may want to conduct are adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) level checks in order to determine the cause of the hyperadrenocorticism, if found. That is, your veterinarian will want to distinguish a pituitary dependent versus an adrenal tumor. Visual imaging, using X-ray, may also be included to determine if the kidneys or surrounding urinary tract organs are damaged in any way. An intravenous pyelogram is the most accurate diagnostic technique for a visual examination of the kidneys, ureter, and urinary bladder. This is a minimally invasive procedure which uses an injection of contrasting material into the bloodstream, where it then collects in the kidneys and urinary tract and illuminates them on the X-ray.
"
"An ultrasonography can be used to assess adrenal size, kidney and liver size and architecture, and uterine size (abnormal findings in the size of one or more of these organs may confirm an infection or reaction to infection). In addition, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan can be used to assess a pituitary or hypothalamic (which links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland) mass, which can be an associated cause of central diabetes insipidus or hyperadrenocorticism.

"Chagas disease is also known as “Kissing Bug Disease” or “American Trypanosomiasis.” It’s caused by a blood parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by kissing bugs.
"

"
" 
"
"Chagas disease affects people as well as dogs and other animals. It is estimated that about 8 million people have Chagas disease.1
"
"Chagas disease is only known to exist in the Americas. It’s common in Latin America and has been reported in the Southern United States, although it is an underrecognized, underdiagnosed, and underreported disease in both humans and dogs.
"
"The kissing bugs that can transmit the disease are currently found in 29 states from the west to east coast.2 Few studies have been done looking at the prevalence of the disease in the United States, but about 50% of kissing bugs appear to carry the parasite that causes the disease.
"
"Although most infected dogs don’t develop symptoms of the disease, testing has shown that about 8% of dogs in some areas may have been infected, and for dogs in high-risk situations, it can be up to 30-50% of dogs that have been infected.3
"
"Most infected dogs never actually develop any symptoms.
"
"
"
"Surgery remains the only treatment option for repairing this deformity. However, if the disease is mild and your dog only has a flat chest, then it may be improved without surgery. In such cases, your veterinarian will instruct you in manually compressing the chest in such a way that will encourage the sternum and costal cartilages to take on a more convex shape.
"
"In some dogs, a splint application will work to reduce the mild defects. However, in cases of moderate or severe inward sinking of the sternum, surgery is indicated for correction of the defects. The technique used by your veterinary surgeon will depend on your dog's age and the extent of the problem. Dogs with respiratory problems that are directly related to this condition, meanwhile, generally improve substantially after surgery and will start breathing more comfortably.
"
"Prognosis is very poor for severely affected patients, but a timely intervention and reparation at an early age may help improve the prognosis. Follow your doctor's guidelines for physical therapy at home if your dog has a mild form of the condition.
"
"After surgery, your dog may feel sore and will need proper rest in a quiet place, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. You might consider cage rest for a short time, until your dog can safely move about again without overexertion. Trips outdoors for bladder and bowel relief should be kept short and easy for your dog to handle during the recovery period.
"
"Your veterinarian may also prescribe a short course of pain killers until your dog has fully recovered, along with a mild course of antibiotics, to prevent any opportunistic bacteria from attacking your dog. Medications will need to be given precisely as directed, at the proper dosage and frequency. Keep in mind that over dosage of pain medications is one of the most preventable causes for death in household animals.

"Treatment for the hyposthenuria will depend on the underlying disorder. Even if your dog is urinating excessively, or is having trouble making it outside in time, do not restrict your dog's water intake unless it is appropriate to the definitive diagnosis and has been recommended by your veterinarian.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up visits to monitor your dog's urine specific gravity, hydration status, kidney function, and electrolyte balance. Dehydration is a possible complication with hyposthenuria, and can quickly become a life threatening condition, so care must be taken to ensure that your dog is properly hydrated at all times.

"However, most dogs that do develop symptoms have issues related to heart disease. These symptoms can be pretty vague but can also be very severe.
"
"Some symptoms are just general symptoms of “not feeling good,” like:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Low energy
"
"Not wanting to or able to exercise and play like usual
"
"Depression
"
"Not wanting to eat
"
"Some more severe symptoms could include:
"
"Having difficulty breathing
"
"Swollen belly
"
"Pale or purple/blue gums
"
"In some cases, there can be sudden death due to the damage to the heart.
"
"If the parasites invade and damage the spine or brain, dogs could have symptoms like:
"
"Weakness
"
"Difficulty walking
"
"Stumbling
"
"Rarely, the nerves to the esophagus and colon can be affected, which causes constipation or regurgitation, which can look like vomiting.
"
"Chagas disease in dogs is caused by a blood parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite lives in the blood of hosts like raccoons, skunks, armadillos, coyotes, squirrels, and other mammals. Humans and domestic animals like dogs, cats, cattle, and horses can also be hosts.
"
"A kissing bug bites and feeds on blood from a host that’s been infected with the parasite. The parasite infects the kissing bug, multiplies, and is pooped out.
"
"That infected poop can enter the body of a new animal after the kissing bug has bitten and fed on them, or the poop could be accidentally rubbed into the eyes or put in the mouth.
"
"Dogs may also eat infected kissing bugs and be infected this way. Infection can also occur if they eat an infected host animal like a raccoon or squirrel.
"
"Once the parasite is in the new animal, it goes to the heart and starts to multiply in the muscle of the heart. This damages the heart and can lead to heart failure. Rarely, the parasite can travel to other areas like the spine or brain and damage the cells there, causing problems with nerve function.
"
"Unfortunately, Chagas disease can be somewhat difficult to diagnose in dogs. There’s nothing on a physical exam that indicates that it’s Chagas disease, so lab testing is needed.
"
"The most accurate test is to look for antibodies to the parasite. This can be done with direct antibody tests or with titers that measure the amount of antibody indirectly. However, infected dogs don’t really produce a lot of antibodies until about 21 days after infection, and they typically start showing symptoms within about 14 days of infection.
"
"So, in the early stages, the antibody test will be negative, and titers will be low even when a dog has Chagas disease.
"
"Repeating testing in several weeks can demonstrate increased titers and the presence of antibodies. PCR tests can look for the parasite’s DNA in a dog’s blood, but these tests aren’t widely available.
"
"Since Chagas disease can cause some vague symptoms, and many other diseases can have those same symptoms, it’s important to be sure there’s not something else going on that would be treated differently. Your vet will do a thorough physical exam and may recommend other testing to try to figure out what’s causing your dog’s symptoms.
"
"Other tests could include regular blood work and urine testing to look for signs of infection or blood loss and to check the health and function of the liver and kidneys, as well as things like electrolytes and thyroid function. They may also recommend x-rays or further testing of the heart like an EKG and echo ultrasound of the heart to look at its function.
"
"Fortunately, most dogs with Chagas disease don’t have any symptoms, so they don’t need treatment. However, for those that do develop symptoms, there are currently limited treatment options available.
"
"An important part of treatment is managing the symptoms that the parasites are causing to the heart (and any other areas, like the spine or brain). Treatments for heart disease may include diuretics and blood pressure medication to help manage fluid buildup and blood pressure as well as medications to help the heart contract more normally.
"
"For Chagas disease that’s affecting a dog’s spine or brain, anti-inflammatories may be used to help reduce the damage and symptoms.
"
"Ideally, treatment would kill the parasites so they couldn’t do any more damage to the heart or other parts of the body. The problem is that the usual medications we use for other parasites do not appear to be effective against the parasite that causes Chagas disease.
"
"While there are a few medications that show some success at dealing with Chagas disease, they are not easy to get in the US. But there is ongoing research, and some promising new options may become available.
"
"For dogs that do develop symptoms, there are acute, latent, and chronic phases of the disease.
"
"In the acute phase, the parasites are causing lots of damage, which will result in your dog feeling generally ill and may also lead to the start of heart disease or heart failure.
"
"Dogs that survive the acute phase may have latent disease, where they don’t really have any symptoms of the disease, or they may develop chronic disease, where they have chronic changes to the heart. This will continue to affect the ability of a dog’s heart to function normally, and it will cause symptoms.
"
"Unfortunately, in the chronic stage of disease, the changes are typically not reversible, so the heart disease is managed with supportive care, including medications to help with fluid buildup, blood pressure, and heart contraction.
"
"Sudden death due to their heart disease is most common in dogs less than 1 year old with the chronic form of Chagas disease.
"
"Chagas disease can be fatal for dogs, and diagnosis and treatment can be difficult, so prevention is important. Since infected kissing bugs are the usual source, avoiding contact with them is a big part of prevention.
"
"Luckily, some of the medications you may already be giving your dog to protect them from things like fleas and ticks can be effective against kissing bugs, too.
"
"Medications like Bravecto, Nexgard, and Trifexis have been shown to kill kissing bugs, but not all flea and tick medications work against kissing bugs. Some other commonly used flea and tick medications, like fipronil, do not seem to be effective, and the medication used to prevent heartworm (ivermectin) is not effective against kissing bugs.
"
"It’s good to get into the habit of checking your dog over after being outside to look for and remove any ticks and kissing bugs, since those can both transmit serious diseases to dogs and people.
"
"Other things that help include preventing dogs from eating any wild animals, since that can be a source of infection. You should also test pregnant dogs to be sure the mother isn’t going to transmit an infection to her puppies.
"
"Not directly, but kissing bugs can carry and transmit a parasite that can cause Chagas disease. Not all dogs who are exposed will develop symptoms, but some dogs can develop fatal heart disease.
"
"Kissing bug disease is caused by a parasite that’s transmitted by the kissing bugs. Except for a mother dog passing it on to her puppies, an infected dog can’t directly give the disease to another dog or person; it has to be transmitted by the kissing bug.

"Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma is a rare cancerous (malignant) tumor that originates from the sweat glands found in the external auditory canal of a dog’s ear. The medical term for ear wax is cerumen. Ceruminous glands are responsible for producing ear wax. Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma is only found in a dog’s ears and its surrounding structures. It always originates in the ear because it’s the only place in the body where ceruminous glands exist.  
"
"Ceruminous gland adenocarcinomas begin to grow within the ear canal and are usually, but not always, distinguished from benign polyps (growth) by how they look. Generally, ceruminous gland adenocarcinomas are irregular in shape and ulcerate (break open) and bleed easily. In contrast, benign growths are smooth. 
"
"Symptoms of ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma are similar to symptoms of a typical ear infection, except only one ear is affected. Common symptoms include: 
"
"Ear scratching 
"
"Head shaking 
"
"Discharge and a foul odor from the ear  
"
"Head tilt  
"
"Pain 
"
"There is usually a greater volume of ear discharge with this type of tumor than with an ear infection, and the discharge may be bloody. If the tumor is large or affecting deep structures of the ear, your dog may show signs such as poor balance, walking in circles, dizziness, and falling to its side.  
"
"The exact cause of ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma is unknown. However, it is suspected that chronic inflammation (swelling) of the ceruminous glands, like the type caused by chronic or recurrent ear infections, is a risk factor.  
"
"This is another reason it is important to treat ear infections at their first sign and make sure they are fully healed before ending treatment. Treating ear infections promptly also prevents pain, ruptured ear drums, and deafness. Cocker Spaniels are more likely to develop ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma than other breeds. This may be related to their high risk for chronic ear infections.  
"
"Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma is the most common ear canal tumor in dogs but remains rare overall. It is more common in cats. 
"
"Your veterinarian will examine the affected ear with an otoscope. This tool shines a light into your dog’s ear to examine the ear canal. Sometimes the tumor can be seen and diagnosed during the first vet exam visit.  
"
"Depending on your dog and the diagnosis, your veterinarian may suggest a sedated ear exam. During this exam, your dog will be given medications to make them unconscious, then the ear will be flushed of all debris and a small camera is guided into the ear for further examination. 
"
"Once the mass is found, your veterinarian may recommend a CT or a biopsy to determine the full extent of the mass. During a biopsy, your vet will carefully take a sample of the tumor. This tissue is examined by a veterinary pathologist to figure out whether it is a benign polyp (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).  
"
"Surgery is the only treatment option to provide dogs with a good prognosis for survival      . 
"
"Before any surgery to remove a cancerous mass, your veterinarian will perform bloodwork and x-rays of the lungs to look for metastatic disease (cancer spread). They may also take samples of lymph nodes near the affected ear to look for metastasis. This is known as staging and helps your veterinarian know whether your dog is a suitable candidate for surgery and the likelihood of a surgical cure.

"The treatment for ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma is surgical removal. The most common surgery for this cancer is a total ear canal ablation (TECA), which involves removal of the entire ear canal, its associated structures, and a deep cleaning of the inner ear. Since auditory structures of the external and middle ear are always removed, and sometimes the inner ear, the dog will be deaf post-surgery in the affected ear. 
"
"If the tumor is contained within the ear canal, this surgery typically cures the condition. If the tumor extends to the skull bones, then radiation or chemotherapy may be needed depending on the diagnosis.  
"
"After the surgery, your veterinarian will follow up with you regarding the results from the pathologist’s report. The pathologist will examine the mass that was removed during surgery and will provide clarity about the type of cancer and whether all was removed.  
"
"After the TECA surgery, your dog will most likely need medications and rest for several weeks. It’s important to give your dog time to recover from major surgery and to adjust to being deaf on the side of the face where the ear was impacted. Most dogs handle this adjustment well, and your vet can help provide further instructions on how to help your dog adapt to their new environment.  
"
"It is important to give all the medications prescribed by your veterinarian to ensure proper healing.   
"
"If you are worried about anything your dog does during the first few weeks of recovery from surgery, call your veterinarian and explain the symptoms. It’s also important to maintain follow-up visits offered by your vet to ensure a speedy and healthy recovery.   
"
"Ceruminous glands release cerumen, also known as ear wax. Ear wax serves important functions, including protecting the deeper structures of the ear and preventing infection from bacteria and fungus (yeast). Sometimes, the ceruminous glands produce too much ear wax, which can promote infection.
"
"The cost of ear surgery will depend on the type of surgery, location, and other factors depending on your dog’s diagnosis. The most common type of surgery for adenocarcinoma is a total ear canal ablation (TECA) or total ear canal ablation with bulla osteotomy (TECA-BO). When performed by a board-certified veterinary surgeon, a TECA or TECA-BO may cost $3,500-$6,000. Always discuss specific treatment options and estimated costs with your veterinarian.
"
"Yes, it is fatal without surgery. If left untreated, survival time is short. With aggressive therapy (surgery), dogs live an average of five more years.
"
"Dogs who undergo a TECA are no longer able to hear on that side. The auditory structures of the ear are removed in the surgery and thus dogs become deaf. Dogs are generally able to adjust quickly to their new situation especially since the cancer likely impacted their hearing before surgery and so it may not be much of a change for them.

"If you’ve ever had a cavity in a tooth, you know how painful cavities can be. Pet parents often forget to prioritize their dog’s oral health, which unfortunately leads to painful dental conditions, including cavities.
"
"Although cavities are much less common in dogs than in people, pet parents should be aware of the signs that their dog could have a cavity and how cavities are managed.
"
"Cavities, which are also called dental caries, are pockets of tooth decay that develop due to prolonged exposure to oral bacteria. Bacteria remaining on the teeth after a dog eats—especially after carbohydrate-rich foods—cause acid to build up, which eats away at the outer enamel layer of a dog’s tooth. Over time, the pocket will become deeper, affecting the dentin and pulp chamber. The dentin is the layer beneath the enamel, while the pulp chamber is the inner part of the tooth with nerves and blood vessels.
"
"Cavities usually look like a dark spot on the tooth’s surface. You’re more likely to notice a cavity on one of your dog’s back teeth. Cavities typically develop in the pits of the tooth rather than on smooth surfaces.
"
"The true prevalence of cavities in dogs is unknown, but one report stated that slightly more than 5% of adult dogs referred to a dental service had cavities. More common dental problems in dogs include fractured teeth and periodontal (gum) disease.
"
"Cavities in dogs aren’t emergencies, but you should contact your vet for a dental evaluation if you’re concerned your dog may have a cavity.
"
"Many treatment options will only be available through a veterinary dentist. Ask your vet for a referral if treatment is outside the scope of their practice and you wish to preserve your dog’s affected tooth.
"
"Symptoms of cavities in dogs may include:
"
"Excessive drooling (hypersalivation)
"
"A dark spot on the tooth
"
"Poor appetite
"
"Dropping food while eating
"
"Dogs likely develop cavities less commonly than people because their diet does not include a lot of sugars and acids. They also tend to have cone-shaped teeth and more space between their teeth than people.
"
"Dogs who eat a diet with fermentable carbohydrates, poor quality food, and table scraps may be more likely to develop cavities than dogs fed a high-quality diet. Additionally, dogs who receive routine dental care are less likely to develop dental caries.
"
"Genetics likely contribute to a dog’s likelihood to develop cavities or other dental issues. Breeds predisposed to cavities are generally the same as those predisposed to dental disease. Examples include:
"
"Chihuahuas
"
"Pugs
"
"American Bulldogs
"
"French Bulldogs
"
"Standard Poodles
"
"Miniature Poodles
"
"Shih Tzu
"
"Dachshunds
"
"Your vet may be able to see a cavity on your dog’s tooth while your pup is awake.
"
"However, to perform a thorough oral exam and fully assess any cavities—including probing the painful spot—your dog must be anesthetized. Anesthesia also allows your vet to perform a dental cleaning and take X-rays of any affected teeth, which are necessary to determine the best treatment strategy.
"
"Treatment of your dog’s cavity will depend on the cavity’s severity. X-rays allow your vet to determine whether the pulp chamber is exposed and whether the tooth’s vitality is compromised.
"
"Cavities that aren’t severe can usually be debrided and restored with a filling, which is like the fillings people get at the dentist. The affected areas of the tooth are drilled away, and the defect is filled.
"
"Teeth with more severe lesions may need a root canal and restoration. In severe cases, extraction of the tooth is recommended. Dental surgery to repair a cavity or extract the tooth requires anesthesia and typically takes one hour or longer.
"
"After dental surgery, your veterinarian will provide instructions to ensure the surgical site heals appropriately.
"
"After surgery, dogs usually recover from anesthesia within several hours and regain their appetite and energy within one to two days.
"
"If your veterinarian prescribes an antibiotic, such as clindamycin, or a pain medication, like carprofen, be sure to follow their instructions for administration. Your veterinarian may also recommend restricting access to hard foods and certain toys after surgery.
"
"Ask your veterinarian whether you need to adjust your dog’s diet or restrict chew toys and games, such as tug-of-war.
"
"The single most effective action a pet parent can take to prevent their dog from getting cavities is regularly brushing their dog's teeth. Daily brushing is the gold standard.
"
"Speak with your veterinarian about dental products, treats, water additives, and other products, but keep in mind that none of these items is as effective as brushing your dog’s teeth.
"
"Ensure you feed your dog a high-quality diet and avoid sugary treats. If you have any questions about your dog’s diet, your veterinarian can discuss appropriate options with you.
"
"Prescription dental diets are available for dogs who are prone to dental issues. Examples include Hill’s® Prescription Diet t/d Dental Care or Royal Canin®/MD Veterinary Diet Dental.
"
"Regular checkups with your veterinarian are also essential for protecting your pet’s dental health.
"
"Your vet will recommend dental cleanings as necessary, which will allow them to fully assess your dog’s dental health. Your veterinarian can also apply a sealant to any teeth they feel may be prone to cavity development.
"
"Costs for cavity repair vary widely. These procedures require anesthesia, a thorough oral exam, X-rays, and dental surgery. With cleaning, fillings, and possibly extractions, costs may reach $600 to $1,200. If multiple teeth are affected, you can expect this cost to increase.
"
"Cavities develop in five stages:
"
"Only the enamel, which is the outer white layer of the tooth, is affected.
"
"The cavity extends to the dentin, which is the tooth layer beneath the enamel.
"
"Damage progresses to the pulp chamber in the center of the tooth, which includes blood vessels and nerves.
"
"The overall structure of the crown is damaged.
"
"Most of the crown is lost and the tooth’s roots may be exposed.
"
"You cannot treat a dog’s cavity at home. Veterinary treatment is required to prevent further damage to the dog’s tooth and relieve pain.

"Cardiomyopathy is most commonly characterized by an irregular heartbeat. Fainting or even sudden heart failure can occur, and some patients can develop congestive heart failure. Cardiomyopathy is specific to the boxer; however, similar symptoms have also been seen in English bulldogs. It tends to occur in dogs that are at least two years old, although symptoms in dogs as young as six months have been reported. At the same time, some patients don’t demonstrate symptoms until they are older than ten years.
"
"Believed to be inherited, but a genetic defect has not been identified.
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your pet's health leading up to the onset of symptoms, including any information you have on your dog's familial background.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to rule out the following possible causes of the symptoms before determining a congenital cause of this condition. An electrocardiogram ECG and an ultrasound of the heart and/or abdomen may be used in the screening process.
"
"Blood tests will be ordered, but not a urinalysis in this case because it would not reveal relevant information. A thoracic radiograph (chest x-ray) might help to determine whether there is enlargement of the heart, or any other evidence of heart failure. If your veterinarian suspects cardiac disease, a heart monitor may be placed on your dog to determine the severity and complexity of the arrhythmia. This will also give a baseline for comparison once treatment is started.
"
"
"
"The first thing your doctor will try to achieve is normalization of the heartbeat and treatment of the symptoms. Avoiding the sudden death that often occurs with these cases will be the top concern. Treatment is complicated when there are no obvious symptoms, and the medication usually prescribed to treat the condition brings on cardiac arrhythmias instead of reducing them. It will be up to your veterinarian to determine whether antiarrhythmic drugs are indicated.
"
"Fainting and heart attack seem to be more frequent with stress and excitement. For that reason, it might be wise to avoid strenuous exercise with your dog. However, there may be no relationship between an unfavorable outcome and exercise. You will need to follow your veterinarian’s advice and use your own judgment.
"
"Your veterinarian may prescribe some medications for treating the arrhythmia. There appears to be some variability as to how dogs respond, so if one option does not seem to be working, it would be reasonable to switch to another.
"
"Your veterinarian may want to place a cardiac monitor on your dog again after starting therapy to evaluate the response to treatment. This will determine whether the medication is working or whether a switch to another one is in order. Wearing the monitor for a period of time once a year is recommended, as well as having an ECG to check the heart's activity. Dogs with this disease are always at risk of sudden death, but even so, many dogs can be maintained for years on an antiarrhythmic medication. Dogs that have systolic dysfunction – a condition where the heart contracts and blood is forced into areas where it can cause harm – do not do as well. But, even these dogs seem to show improvement on l-carnitine, a supplement that is used to bring carnitine levels up. Carnitine is essential for the fully functioning body, since it stimulates fatty-acid oxidation.

"Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless, non-irritating gas produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon fuels. It is potentially toxic for dogs as well as humans. Common sources of carbon monoxide are unventilated kerosene or propane heaters, gasoline engines, automobile exhaust, or fumes from carbon-based fuel heating systems.
"
"When inhaled, this gas is readily absorbed into the blood, combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, reducing oxygen delivery to the body, and thereby leading to decreased utilization of oxygen in the brain and heart. Most cases of carbon monoxide toxicity in dogs occur as a result of human error, such as when a dog has been left in an enclosed area where carbon monoxide is being released. A dog left in an enclosed garage with a running automobile can be exposed to toxic levels of carbon monoxide in about ten minutes. Animals are also exposed to toxic levels of carbon monoxide when they are trapped in a building that is on fire. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide will lead to hypoxemia and eventually death.
"
"Depending upon the concentration and duration of exposure of carbon monoxide, the symptoms may be acute or chronic in nature.
"
"Symptoms with chronic exposure to carbon monoxide include:
"
"Exposure to any source of carbon monoxide, like:
"
"The foremost step in carbon monoxide toxicity is to get your dog away from the source of the carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide toxicity is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate veterinary intervention. Your veterinarian will start immediate oxygen therapy to remove the carbon monoxide from the blood and bring your dog's oxygen levels back to normal. While your dog is receiving oxygen your veterinarian will collect samples of blood for diagnostic testing. A complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis and other applicable body fluid tests will be performed. Your veterinarian will also collect samples for determination of carboxyhemoglobin levels in the blood. Establishing the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood is the most useful test for basing the initial treatment plan.
"
"Carboxyhemoglobin levels rise in acute cases and drop within a few hours once exposure to the source of the carbon monoxide has been removed. Levels of acids in the blood will also be determined during blood testing, as acid concentrations tend to rise in response to this condition and their values will determine the appropriate diagnosis and medical response. Other diagnostic tools your veterinarian may use include an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine whether the heart has also been affected.
"
"
"
"If you suspect that your dog has been subjected to excessive amounts of carbon monoxide, immediately call for veterinary help. In the meantime, remove your dog from the source of the toxic gas to a location where it can breathe fresh air. Your veterinarian will start emergency treatment to restore adequate levels of oxygen to the vital organs. Supplementation of 100 percent pure oxygen is the best method for initiating a quick recovery. Fluids will also be given to improve blood perfusion to vital organs like the brain, as well as to normalize the increased concentrations of acids in blood.
"
"While your dog is recovering from the carbon monoxide poisoning, limit its activity for at least six weeks. Rather than long walks, take short walks with your dog. Slow down on the playtime and exercise until your dog has fully recovered all of its physical faculties. Your dog may need some extra affection during this time. Do what you can to keep the dog calm and relaxed. Watch your dog for any recurrence of symptoms and call for help if you suspect any untoward symptoms in your dog. Nervous symptoms may be seen in some animal patients even weeks after the initial recovery. If you do become aware of any nervous system abnormalities, call your veterinarian for advisement.
"
"Carbon monoxide is as lethal to you as to your dogs, therefore, use carbon monoxide detectors at home to prevent possible or re-occurring episodes. The human element is the most important line of prevention. Protect your dogs from any sources of carbon monoxide.

"Persistent sinus arrest that is not due to the use of a drug is often indicative of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) - a disorder of the heart’s electrical impulse formation within the sinus node. The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat, or contract, by firing off electrical surges. Sinus arrest is a disorder of heart beat impulse formation caused by a slowing down or cessation of spontaneous sinus nodal automaticity – the automatic behavior of the tissues that set the pace for the heart's rhythm. It is the failure of the sinoatrial (SA) node to initiate an impulse at the expected time that leads to sinus arrest.
"
"Sinoatrial block is a disorder of impulse conduction. This is when an impulse formed within the sinus node fails to be conducted through the atria (the interior of the heart), or when it is delayed in doing so. More commonly, the basic rhythm of the sinus node is not disturbed when the impulses fail to conduct properly.
"
"Sinoatrial block is classified into first, second, and third-degree SA block (similar to degrees of atrioventricular [AV] block). It is difficult to diagnose first and third-degree SA block from an electrocardiogram (ECG) reading only.
"
"Second-degree SA block is the most common type of SA block, and the only degree that can be recognized on a surface ECG. In addition, there are two types of second-degree SA blocks: Mobitz type I (also called Wenckebach periodicity)  and Mobitz type II.
"

"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. The electrolyte panel may show hyperkalemia, abnormal levels of potassium in the blood, which can lead to arrhythmias. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a history of symptoms, and their onset.
"
"Thoracic (chest) x-rays and/or a cardiac ultrasound imaging may be taken by your veterinarian to confirm or rule out heart disease and abnormal tissue growth (neoplasia). 
"
"A provocative atropine response test may be done to assess sinus node function. This test uses the drug atropine to stimulate the firing action of the SA Node. Dogs with SSS generally will have no response, or will have an incomplete response to the atropine.
"
"
"
"Most dogs can be treated on an outpatient basis. Only patients showing clinical signs of illness should be hospitalized. Fluid therapy will be given to patients in need of it. If your dog is very ill patients and is not responding to medical therapy may require implantation of an artificial pacemaker, and will be hospitalized prior to surgery in preparation of it. If your dog becomes excessively weak, or is showing signs of losing consciousness, or fainting, it will need to have its activity restricted.
"
"After care will be dependent on whether your dog has an underlying disease, along with the SA block. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary, and an ECG reading will be done at each visit to follow your dog's progress.  If your dog becomes weak, or loses consciousness, contact your veterinarian immediately for advisement.

"L-carnitine is an important nutrient that acts as a transport for fatty acids, essential for the cellular production of energy.
"
"L-carnitine is an important nutrient that acts as a transport for fatty acids, essential for the cellular production of energy. Deficiency of this nutrient can cause a variety of health problems for  animals; most significantly, the association with heart disease  (cardiomyopathy) in dogs. The heart and skeletal muscles do not synthesize the nutrient on their own, requiring it to be transported there for use. Because of this, when the body is deficient in carnitine, the heart and skeletal muscles are negatively affected. While carnitine supplements are not always able to reverse the effects of this deficiency, they have proven to be the most successful course of treatment.
"
"The signs of this deficiency may include:
"
"L-carnitine is important for muscle tissue to receive energy and function normally; therefore, a deficiency in this nutrient can create a negative impact throughout a dog's body.
"
"While causes of carnitine deficiency is unknown, it is believed some dog breeds show an increased risk of developing the deficiency, including Boxers, Doberman Pinschers, Great Danes, Irish wolfhounds, and other giant breeds.
"
"In order to diagnose this deficiency, heart (endomyocardial) muscle biopsies must be performed to measure carnitine levels.
"
"
"
"The size of the dog will determine the proper dosage. While L-carnitine supplements may improve this deficiency, keep in mind that many dogs will not show improvement. In addition, some dogs will show an increase in diarrhea as the carnitine dosage in their diet increases.
"
"After the carnitine treatment begins, it is recommended that the dog have an EKG (echocardiogram) every three to six months to ensure the treatment has been effective.
"
"There are no known methods of prevention, other than maintaining a healthy diet for your dog and monitoring for signs of deficiency, especially if your dog is a breed that is known to be affected by this condition.

"A cataract is an imperfection, an opacity, or a “clouding” of the lens of the eye. The function of the lens is to allow passage of light and images directly to the retina where vision occurs. The lens should be crystal clear, but diseases of the lens, like cataracts, can change its transparency or clarity.
"
"Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians.
"
"Cataracts may be too small to interfere with vision, so large as to drastically impair vision or anywhere in between. To detect cataracts in dogs, simply look for whiteness on the pupils in one or both eyes.
"
"Cataracts are classified by:
"
"The dog’s age at onset:
"
"Congenital: present at birth
"
"Juvenile: young dogs
"
"Senile: older dogs
"
"Anatomic location
"
"Cause
"
"Shape
"
"Degree of opaqueness can be broken down even further to the following:
"
"Incipient: Cataracts are so small they often require magnification to diagnose. These involve less than 15% of the lens and cause no vision loss. Many dogs won’t notice these, and surgery to remove the cataract is rarely recommended at this stage.
"
"Immature: Cataracts involve more than 15% and up to 99% of the lens—often multiple layers or areas. The retina can still be seen during examination and visual deficits are typically mild. Significant vision loss usually occurs with cataracts that cover 75% of the lens, but the degree to which it affects the dog varies.
"
"Mature: Cataracts involve the entire lens, and the retina cannot be seen during examination. Visual deficits are often significant, with blindness or near-blindness often detected. Dogs with mature cataracts can only see changes in light. They should undergo surgery to remove the cataracts if all other systemic illnesses are under control.
"
"Hyper-mature Cataracts: the lens begins to shrink, and the lens capsule appears wrinkled. Lens-induced uveitis (inflammation within the eye) often occurs at this stage.
"
"If cataracts occupy less than 30% of the lens, or if only one eye is affected, they rarely cause reduced vision. When the opacity covers about 60% of the total lens area, vision loss often becomes obvious. If the opacity progresses to 100% of the lens, the dog will be blind in the affected eye. Whether the cataract remains stable or progresses depends on the type of cataract, the breed of dog and other risk factors.
"
"Hereditary cataracts occur commonly in young dogs between 1 and 5 years old. Breeds most susceptible to hereditary cataracts are:
"
"American Staffordshire Terrier
"
"American Cocker Spaniel
"
"French Bulldog
"
"Labrador Retriever
"
"Miniature Poodle
"
"Miniature Schnauzer
"
"Boston Terrier
"
"Siberian Husky
"
"Yorkshire Terrier
"
"Welsh Springer Spaniel
"
"Cataract that dissolve on their own without treatment is referred to as cataract dissolution, and can cause deep inflammation within the eye. The cataract completely blocks light from entering the eye through the lens and keeps your dog from seeing. The condition is still treatable at that time with surgery, but without treatment, the condition can develop into glaucoma.
"
"Glaucoma happens when fluid in your dog’s eye doesn’t drain properly, causing a painful increase in the pressure of the eye. Not all untreated cataracts develop into glaucoma, but dogs who have glaucoma are often not candidates for cataract removal surgery. Medical and surgical treatments exist for glaucoma, but in general, it carries a poor prognosis for preserving long-term vision.
"
"Puppies with complete juvenile cataracts won’t be able to see well and may start bumping into things. You may also see that the middle of the pupil has a white spot.
"
"Bring your dog to the veterinarian if you see any signs that the eyes have changed in color or clarity. Also, if puppies are squinting or scratching at their eyes, or showing any signs of illness, bring them to the veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"When dogs have a cataract, it distorts their vision. Therefore, symptoms are usually related to the degree of vision loss. A cataract can start out the size of a pinpoint and grow to the size of the entire lens, and cause blindness. Dogs with less than 30% lens opacity will display few - if any - symptoms, even though there might be a visible lesion on the eye.
"
"Cataracts cause dogs to experience disorientation or confusion if the cataracts develop quickly, such as with diabetes mellitus. Inflammation associated with cataracts can be painful and lead to glaucoma, which is even more painful. The pain is from the body reacting to what is perceived as a foreign substance on the lens. If the cataracts are caused by diabetes mellitus, you may also see increased thirst and urination, changes in appetite, and/or weight loss in your dog, along with lesions on the eyes and associated vision loss.
"
"The most common cause of cataracts in dogs is hereditary/genetic disease. Cataracts also occur commonly in dogs as a complication of diabetes mellitus. There are other causes that are much less common, such as:
"
"Old age
"
"Trauma, such as electric shock
"
"Inflammation of the eye’s uvea (uveitis)
"
"Low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia or hypoparathyroidism)
"
"Nutritional deficiencies (less understood, but cataracts have been linked to lack of amino acids such as Tryptophan, during development of puppies who are fed commercial milk-replacer supplements)
"
"Exposure to UV light (most common cause of cataracts in humans), radiation or toxic substances
"
"Cataracts that are secondary to diabetes mellitus are increasingly common in dogs. The increased blood glucose causes sugars within the lens of the eye to accumulate. Normally, these cataracts develop quickly and can rupture the lens capsule. If the cataract is a result of diabetes mellitus, it's possible to slow the progress by changing your dog’s diet and insulin intake. If the cataract has progressed far enough, surgery might also be an option.
"
"If you notice a cloudiness in one or both of your dog’s eyes, it’s important to have the dog examined by your veterinarian as soon as possible. The vet will ask about your dog’s medical history and previous health concerns, including when you first noticed the symptoms, and conduct a complete physical examination to focus on the eyes and structures around the eye. Initial diagnostic testing (such as a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile and urinalysis) usually do not show any abnormalities unless there is co-existing disease, such as diabetes mellitus or hypocalcemia.
"
"During the initial eye exam, your vet will use several tests to make a diagnosis of cataracts. These preliminary test results will also establish a baseline for comparing your dog’s progress over time. It will be necessary to dilate your dog’s eyes to get a better look at the outside edge of the cataract and the back of the eye (if possible). Cataracts should also be differentiated from other lens imperfections in young dogs and the normal increase in nuclear density (otherwise known as nuclear sclerosis) that occurs in older animals. Tests include the following:
"
"Slit lamp biomicroscopy: A special light is shone in the dog’s eye, which allows for direct examination of the lens.
"
"Schirmer tear test: A small filter paper is placed inside the dog’s lower eyelid. When the paper is removed, it is tested for moisture content to measure tear production.
"
"Fluorescein stain: Usually neon orange or yellow, ocular stains are used to evaluate the integrity of the surface of the eye, looking for defects to the cornea, such as scratches or the presence of any foreign materials.
"
"Tonometry: After numbing the surface of the eye with an eye drop, the vet uses a small “pen” to tap the surface of the eye to measure intraocular pressure.
"
"If your veterinarian is unable to do these tests, or the test results indicate an abnormality, you will be referred to a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist in your area.
"
"If based on the state of the eyes and the appearance of the cataracts, it is decided that cataract surgery is needed, further testing will be done to ensure that the retina (the structure in the back of the eye that processes light information and sends it to the brain) is healthy. Some cataracts occur secondary to or are associated with loss of retinal function or retinal detachment.
"
"Pre-operative tests to evaluate the retina include an electroretinogram (ERG) and an ocular ultrasound to measure the electrical responses of cells present in the retina. These tests usually require your dog to be sedated and can take a few hours. If retinal function is compromised, this will affect your dog’s ability to see well - even after cataract removal. In these cases, cataract surgery is not recommended.
"
"There are no medical therapies currently available to reduce or “cure” cataracts. Currently, surgery is the only option. Research is ongoing into a few topical eye medications including topical aldose reductase inhibitors (ARI eye drops) have shown some success in cataracts caused by diabetes mellitus.
"
"To guarantee the best chance of restored vision after cataract surgery, the health of both the eyes and the dog are evaluated. This step is critical, as any underlying diseases such as a skin or a dental disease should be under control prior to cataract surgery.
"
"Cataracts are a progressive disease, and if surgery is recommended, it should be done in a timely manner. Pre-operative medication must begin and continue for several days to a few weeks prior to surgery to make sure any inflammation in the eyes associated with the cataracts is controlled. The long-term success rates reported in dogs following uncomplicated cataract surgery range from 85–90%.
"
"The only definitive therapy for cataracts is removal of the diseased lens using a modern cataract surgical method called phacoemulsification. This surgical procedure involves the emulsification, or liquefying, of the eye’s lens with an ultrasonic probe. Once the lens is liquified and removed, fluids are replaced with a balanced salt solution. A corrective or artificial lens, similar to a contact lens, may be implanted on the eye during surgery. This new lens will be permanently attached to the eye.
"
"Estimated costs are as follows:
"
"Initial exam with an ophthalmologist: $200–$300
"
"ERG, ultrasound and blood work: $1,000–$1,200
"
"Cataract surgery on both eyes: $2,700–$4,000, including pre-operative examination, surgery, anesthesia, operating room use, hospitalization, and post-operative medications.
"
"The average cost is $3,500, which may include a post-operative checkup as well.
"
"Remember that these costs are only estimates and may increase or decrease depending on the nature of the cataracts, the presence of systemic disease (such as diabetes mellitus) and whether complications occur during or after surgery.
"
"After surgery, dogs are usually kept in the hospital overnight. They must wear an Elizabethan collar or inflatable cone to keep them from scratching at their eye. Owners will be given eye drops to administer to their dog at least two to four times a day while at home.
"
"Surgery to correct a dog’s cataract involves a lifelong commitment from the owner. Dog owners looking to treat immature cataracts must start their dog on a regimen of multiple anti-inflammatory eye drops at the time of diagnosis. These drops will likely need to be used throughout the dog’s life.
"
"The rate of progression of this disease depends on the underlying cause of the cataract, the location of cataract and the age of the dog. Cataract surgery for dogs with diabetes mellitus appears to yield the same success rate as for hereditary cataracts.
"
"Since most cases of cataracts are hereditary, there isn’t much a pet parent can do to prevent the condition. However, feeding your dog a high-quality diet that is rich with omega-3 fatty acids can help promote eye heath. Discuss  supplement options with your vet to find the best product that is the most beneficial.
"
"You should also be mindful of how much exposure your dog has to UV rays. You can help prevent cataracts in dogs by blocking harmful UV rays, by making sure your dog has plenty of shade while outdoors and having them wear protective goggles such as Rex Specs if you are in an area of high exposure area. 
"
"Cataracts in dogs are surgically removed using a technique called phacoemulsification, which offers an 85–90% success rate.
"
"There are no medical therapies currently available to reduce or cure cataracts. Surgical treatment is the only permanent solution that can restore your dog’s vision.  
"
"No. Cataracts left untreated can cause deep inflammation within the eye and lead to glaucoma. These conditions are very painful.
"
"Immature cataracts in dogs involve from 15–99% of the lens, and often involve multiple layers of the lens, or different areas. The retina can still be seen during examination, and visual deficits are typically mild. Usually, significant vision loss can be seen with cataracts that cover 75% of the lens or more, but the degree to which this impacts the dog varies.
"
"If not treated properly, most cataracts will lead to total blindness in the affected eye or eyes.

"Capillariasis is a type of dog worm caused by a parasitic known as Capillaria plica. The worm infects the urinary bladder and sometimes other parts of the urinary tract.
"
"Often, there are no symptoms and diagnosis is incidental. However, especially in dogs with a heavy infection, symptoms include:
"
"Capillaria plica is the parasitic dog worm that causes capillariasis. Its lifecycle is not completely understood. However, we know that ova (worm eggs) pass out of the body through the urine of infected dogs. These ova embryonate and then may be ingested from the soil by earthworms. The Capillaria worm then continues to develop inside the earthworm to an infective stage. When another dog then ingests the earthworm, infection can occur.
"
"Diagnosis is through identification of Capillaria ova in the urine of the infected dog. The ova are characteristic in appearance: football-shaped with plugs at both ends of the ova.
"
"
"
"Treatment is often not recommended if the dog is not ill. However, if symptoms of infection are present, the drugs fenbendazole or ivermectin can be used to treat the infection.
"
"For dogs staying in a kennel that is housed on soil, replacing the soil with an alternative substrate or surface (such as sand, gravel, or concrete) may reduce infection rates of this type of dog worm.

"Canine coronavirus is a highly infectious viral disease affecting dogs all around the world. Its name is based on the virus appearing to resemble a crown when viewed under a high-powered microscope.  
"
"Canine coronavirus is very different from the human novel coronavirus causing the pandemic of 2020 (COVID-19). Canine coronavirus is not transmissible to humans. Canine coronaviruses are, however, highly contagious between dogs.  
"
"Canine coronavirus often causes mild or hard-to-spot symptoms; however, it can be fatal under certain conditions. Because canine coronavirus is highly contagious, it is common in kenneled dogs but can also occur in healthy dogs who have no symptoms of the virus.  
"
"There are two main types of canine coronavirus in the United States: enteric and respiratory.  
"
"Enteric canine coronavirus spreads through feces and causes damage to the cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. Dogs typically display clinical signs related to gastrointestinal upset, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy.  
"
"Respiratory canine coronavirus spreads through the air and enters the lungs. It is part of a larger respiratory disease complex in dogs and causes coughing, sneezing, and difficulty breathing.  
"
"Symptoms of canine coronavirus vary based on the strain.  
"
"When a dog has canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV), the virus travels to the intestinal cells and replicates quickly, destroying those cells in the process. Young, immunocompromised, or stressed dogs (such as those in dogs shows or shelters) may have more severe symptoms.  
"
"Those symptoms may include:  
"
"Diarrhea (sometimes bloody)  
"
"Vomiting 
"
"Decreased appetite 
"
"Painful abdomen 
"
"Lethargy 
"
"Dehydration 
"
"Fever 
"
"Seizures in severe cases 
"
"Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is part of the complex disease called Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease, or CIRD. Healthy dogs can also carry this virus without obvious symptoms. Typically, dogs acquire CRCoV in addition to other bacteria and viruses, including:  
"
"Canine distemper virus 
"
"Canine parainfluenza virus 
"
"Canine adenovirus 
"
"Canine influenza virus 
"
"Canine herpesvirus 
"
"Canine reovirus 
"
"Canine pneumovirus 
"
"Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria 
"
"Mycoplasma bacterial species 
"
"Streptococcus species 
"
"Zooepidemicus species 
"
"Canine respiratory coronavirus is a common cause of quick-onset upper respiratory disease in dogs, especially those in crowded or stressful settings. The virus attacks the cells lining the lungs, causing damage, and allowing other opportunistic bacteria to follow.  
"
"Symptoms can vary from mild to severe depending on the other bacteria involved. Common symptoms include: 
"
"Coughing 
"
"Sneezing 
"
"Difficulty breathing 
"
"Eye discharge 
"
"Nasal discharge 
"
"Gagging/regurgitation at the end of the cough 
"
"Fever 
"
"Lethargy 
"
"Decreased appetite 
"
"Canine coronavirus is highly contagious and spreads quickly between dogs. Dogs develop canine enteric coronavirus through ingestion of infected feces. The incubation period after exposure is 1-3 days. Dogs, symptomatic or not, may then shed the virus in their feces for 2 weeks.  
"
"Canine respiratory coronavirus is transmitted through: 
"
"Respiratory secretions aerosolized and inhaled 
"
"Direct contact between dogs 
"
"Contaminated objects that may easily carry bacteria or viruses, such as blankets, bowls, toys, etc.
"
"If your vet suspects your dog has canine coronavirus, they will perform an examination. This may include reviewing your dog’s health history and current symptoms. They will ask you about any concerns you have about your dog’s health including behavior and noticeable symptoms. 
"
"Depending on the severity of your dog’s symptoms, your veterinarian may recommend performing a blood chemistry test and complete blood count to have a clear overall picture of your dog’s health. This can help determine if your dog requires antibiotics, or other treatments. 
"
"Your vet may take x-rays of your dog’s abdomen and chest to rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms.
"
"Your veterinarian will treat your dog’s canine coronavirus based on health history and current symptoms. Because there is not a specific treatment for canine coronavirus, your veterinarian will prescribe treatment of your dog’s symptoms to lessen their severity.   
"
"Dogs with both CECoV and CRCoV may not require any treatment at all because many dogs recover on their own. Depending on the severity, some dogs may receive outpatient treatment such as:  
"
"Fluids for hydration 
"
"Oral anti-nausea medications  
"
"Oral anti-diarrheal medications  
"
"Gastrointestinal prescription foods  
"
"Probiotics to re-establish gastrointestinal flora  
"
"Anti-inflammatories and/or cough medicine for coughing in dogs with CRCoV  
"
"More severe cases may require hospitalization with:  
"
"IV fluids for hydration 
"
"IV antibiotics and/or anti-nausea medications  
"
"Nutritional support—feeding tubes or total parenteral nutrition 
"
"Appetite stimulants 
"
"Heat support 
"
"Oxygen or use of a nebulizer for dogs with CRCoV 
"
"Most dogs will recover fully within two weeks from both the enteric and respiratory strains. However, dogs who have been hospitalized due to canine coronavirus may require one (or more) follow-up visits to the vet to assess their recovery progress.  
"
"Overall, the prognosis for both the enteric and respiratory forms of canine coronavirus is good, unless in severe cases or in young animals. Especially with early veterinary intervention and supportive care, most dogs quickly recover. 
"
"Cleaning the environment, especially in shelters or large pack environments, is important to prevent canine coronavirus. Common disinfectants like bleach kill canine coronavirus. It is also important to quarantine symptomatic dogs to prevent the spread of either strain of canine coronavirus to other dogs.  
"
"Although there is a vaccine for canine enteric coronavirus, most veterinarians do not recommend administering it, because it’s not been proven effective at preventing the virus. There are, however, vaccines for other types CIRD that are considered part of the standard recommended vaccines by the American Animal Hospital Association.

"Down syndrome is a common chromosomal condition in people. It is associated with cognitive delays and certain physical characteristics, along with a higher risk of certain health issues.
"
"If you notice that your dog has some traits that are indicative of Down syndrome, you might wonder if it’s possible for dogs to have Down syndrome, too.
"
"To answer that question, we first have to understand what Down syndrome is. The National Down Syndrome Society provides a good explanation:
"
"“In every cell in the human body there is a nucleus, where genetic material is stored in genes.  Genes carry the codes responsible for all of our inherited traits and are grouped along rod-like structures called chromosomes.  Typically, the nucleus of each cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, half of which are inherited from each parent. Down syndrome occurs when an individual has a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21.”
"
"Canine herpesvirus (CHV) is a condition specific to canines including dogs, wolves, and coyotes. CHV is primarily a reproductive disease, which means many of our canine companions (and their pet parents) do not have to worry too much about it.  
"
"However, CHV is a significant problem for breeders because it can have a high mortality rate for puppies 3 weeks old and younger and is a major cause of spontaneous abortion and stillbirths. After 3 weeks, a puppy’s body temperature begins to rise and her ability to fight the virus improves. Puppies over 6 months old rarely succumb to the virus. 
"
"Exposure usually occurs through the nose, mouth or genitals. For puppies (and canine fetuses), the virus can replicate and can spread throughout the lymphatic system and blood stream causing widespread harm.  
"
"Herpesviruses also travels to the nerve cells where they can “camouflage” themselves, lying dormant and causing infection in times of stress. Dogs can then shed the virus intermittently throughout their lives.  
"
"Given the seriousness of the virus, for many pet parents or breeders, the only sign they may notice is unfortunately, a deceased puppy. For others, signs can include: 
"
"Failure to thrive, such as failing to nurse or gain weight 
"
"Excessive crying 
"
"Listlessness 
"
"Body temperature lower than normal 
"
"The presence of this extra genetic material has a wide range of effects. People with Down syndrome can have some degree of intellectual impairment, but this varies between individuals and is usually mild to moderate.
"
"According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are also some common physical features of Down syndrome, such as poor muscle tone and a line across the palm of the hand (palmar crease).
"
"The Global Down Syndrome Society points out that while some of these features may be common, they are not universal, and “although children and adults with Down syndrome may share some common features, they look more like their immediate family members than like each other.”
"
"Genetically, dogs and people have many similarities, but important differences obviously do exist. For example, people have 23 sets of chromosomes while dogs have 39.
"
"Down syndrome happens when there is a full or partial copy of chromosome 21. But a duplication of all or part of chromosome 21 would have different effects in the two species.
"
"Simply put, the answer is no. The condition of Down syndrome has not been described in dogs. Three explanations are possible:
"
"On the other hand, congenital or developmental conditions that have some clinical similarities with Down syndrome are routinely diagnosed in dogs.
"
"Congenital hypothyroidism is a good example. This condition is caused by low or absent levels of thyroid hormone at birth and early in life, which results in some combination of the following:
"
"Other conditions in dogs that could be confused with Down syndrome include:
"
"If you have noticed any of the above characteristics in your dog, talk to your veterinarian. They can recommend an appropriate diagnostic plan to see if your dog has any health issues and make treatment recommendations once a diagnosis is in place.

"
"Other signs include diarrhea, runny nose, pneumonia, and petechiae (pin-point hemorrhages) on the belly, inner ears, conjunctiva, or gums.  
"
"Adult dogs suffering from the virus may not exhibit any clinical signs or may exhibit mild signs associated with a common cold (i.e., cough, runny nose, or lethargy). Some may also exhibit infertility, lesions on their genitalia, and dogs that are pregnant may exhibit a sudden loss of their litter or stillbirth(s).
"
"CHV is often spread from one dog to another via direct contact, either through saliva, nasal, or vaginal discharge/secretions or by sexual contact. Rarely, the virus can be transmitted by fomites (objects carrying the virus, such as clothes, water, and food bowls). Usually, the virus spreads between puppies and dogs that co-mingle, such as those in a litter. The virus also can also be passed from mother to offspring.
"
"A veterinarian may suspect canine herpesvirus with a puppy that is 3 weeks or younger and shows clinical symptoms (or has passed away).  
"
"A PCR test may be done on tissue samples or fluids, but unfortunately most diagnoses are done after the puppy has died by looking for lesions associated with canine herpesvirus. 
"
"Unfortunately, once diagnosed or even suspected, the outcome for most infected puppies is poor. In many cases, a puppy will have already passed, or the veterinarian will recommend euthanasia. It is important to examine the puppy even after she has passed so precautions can be taken to limit the virus’ transmission and protect siblings or other dogs in the household. 
"
"It’s important to remember that the virus is sensitive to heat so maintaining a warmer ambient temperature for the surviving pups may help prevent transmission. Some antivirals and antibody serum injections have been reported as a form of treatment and other forms of treatment often utilized are usually supportive care measures such as rehydration, getting the puppy to eat, or medications administered to alleviate pain, nausea, and diarrhea.  
"
"Unfortunately, most affected puppies do not survive, but those that do often lead a life with long-term debilitating effects such as blindness, kidney disease, or neurologic dysfunction.  
"
"Many adult dogs and puppies older than 3 weeks of age go on to lead a relatively normal life. Some may be affected with fertility issues and females that are infected prior to becoming pregnant, or have already suffered an abortion from the virus, can go on to have healthy litters in the future (assuming the pups do not acquire the infection elsewhere).   
"
"Canine herpesvirus is a common and deadly virus that has been found worldwide and once infected, will never go away. Chances are, your dog has already been affected, as most are, just from normal daily interactions. But note that older dogs who become infected will rarely show any clinical signs since it is only dangerous to puppies.
"
"No. Only dogs, wolves and coyotes are susceptible to this type of herpesvirus. As is common for this type of virus, however, dogs can become latent carriers and periodically shed or spread the virus throughout their lives and it may even cause signs in the dog during times of stress.
"
"Unfortunately, there’s no commercially available vaccine in the United States. Good hygiene, isolation of pregnant dogs prior to birth and then isolation of the mom and litter for the first several weeks of life, and a warm and clean puppy environment are precautions you can take to minimize the chances of your puppy getting sick. Fortunately, most household disinfectants are effective in killing the virus.

"Cardiac arrest (also known as cardiopulmonary arrest or circulatory arrest) occurs when normal blood circulation ceases due to the heart's inability to contract (heart failure). Like many other body systems, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems work in a coordinated fashion. Therefore, if a dog fails to breathe for more than six minutes, it can lead to heart failure and cardiac arrest -- both of which can be fatal. Cardiac arrest can occur in dogs of any age, sex, or breed.
"
"Blood circulation may remain intact if the animal resumes breathing within four minutes of the initial problem. However, if it lasts longer than six minutes it can lead to cardiac arrest. Common symptoms associated with this emergency include:
"
"Cardiac arrest is an emergency that will require immediate veterinary assistance to assess the animal's condition and the form of treatment. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated the complications. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, focusing on the dog's airways, breathing ability, and circulation. Your veterinarian will also constantly monitor your dog's blood pressure and pulse rate.
"
"Routine diagnostic exams used to determine the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest include chest X-rays, complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. Blood samples are collected to determine the level of gases, including oxygen, in the blood. Dogs suspected of having an underlying heart disease may undergo echocardiography to evaluate the extent of the problem.
"
"
"
"This is a life-threatening emergency that will require immediate hospitalization and intensive nursing support and treatment. The primary goal is to restart the dog's heart rhythm and respiration rate, which may require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
"
"Once the trachea is cleared and CPR is performed, a tube may be passed into the trachea to facilitate breathing. Oxygen may also be supplied to normalize the blood oxygen levels.
"
"Dogs with heart failure may require external cardiac massage to stimulate heart to beat normally. Those unresponsive to cardiac massage may receive rapid chest compressions. Typically medications are administered to assist in normalizing cardiac functions. Otherwise, the chest is incised to provide the open chest resuscitation to the animal or medications are administered directly into the heart -- both of which are considered a last resort.
"
"The overall prognosis will depend on the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest and the course of treatment. Unfortunately, less than 10 percent of dogs recover, even after successful emergency treatment.
"
"If your dog's condition does stabilize, it will need to stay in the hospital for a few days. There, the veterinarian may monitor cardiac functions and blood pressure and and treat any further complications.

"Anticipating a fearful or negative experience with certain people, objects, animals, or situations can lead to anxiety.
"
"But when does anxiety veer into panic? Can dogs have panic attacks? Here’s everything you need to know about panic attacks in dogs.
"
"Dogs can certainly experience panic attacks, similar to people. People who suffer from panic attacks report a sudden feeling of intense fear.
"
"They may experience a physiological response, such as an elevated heart rate. They may also sweat, tremble, be nauseous, and have a headache.
"
"Usually, there is no specific trigger, but the panic attack can occur during times of high stress.
"
"Of course we cannot ask a dog how they feel, but we can look for the signs of panic, such as:
"
"Sudden panting
"
"Pacing
"
"Trembling
"
"Excessive salivation
"
"Looking for a place to hide
"
"Seeking their owner’s attention in a frantic manner
"
"Pawing or jumping up on their owner
"
"Digging in the bed, closet, or bathroom
"
"Vomiting
"
"Gastrointestinal upset (immediate defecation or diarrhea, for example)
"
"Urinating
"
"One of my canine patients who was experiencing panic pulled out the drawer under the oven and tried to hide in the opening.
"
"Is your dog having anxiety, suffering from a phobia, or having a panic attack?
"
"How we distinguish a phobia from a panic attack is based on a presence of a trigger. If there is a specific trigger that elicits those intense reactions from your dog, then it may be classified as a phobia.
"
"People with phobias have described it as experiencing an irrational fear of something. This feeling can be similar in dogs.
"
"The trigger can be a sound, person, object, location, or situation. Many dogs experience phobias to thunderstorms and fireworks.
"
"Usually there is no trigger that causes the panic attack in a dog.
"
"So what about anxiety?
"
"Anxiety comes when your dog is dreading a specific event or situation. The anticipated threat can be real or perceived.
"
"An example is a dog showing signs of anxiety before a vet trip. They have picked up on the cues that they are going to the vet, and become anxious about the encounter. Some signs of anxiety in dogs include:
"
"Panting
"
"Pacing
"
"Vocalizing
"
"Eliminating inappropriately or involuntarily
"
"Soliciting attention from their owners
"
"Pulling ears back against their head with the head lowered and tail hanging down or tucked under the abdomen
"
"Dogs that experience panic attacks should receive a thorough physical examination from their veterinarian. Diagnostic tests may be performed to rule out any medical causes for the reactions.
"
"Pet owners should also make sure they provide plenty of physical and mental exercise for their dogs—as long as their veterinarian approves the level of exercise.
"
"A minimum of a 15-20 minute walk and/or 15-20 minutes of play every day can reduce a dog’s stress levels.
"
"Providing your dogs with puzzle toys to work for their meals can also help stimulate and tire out their brain.
"
"Short training sessions can be helpful to keep your dog mentally occupied as well.
"
"If your dog is having a panic attack and he comes to you for attention, you can pet, hug, or hold him if that helps ease the signs of his panic.
"
"Depending on how intense the episode is, you can try to:
"
"Distract and redirect your dog to play with toys
"
"Take your dog for a walk
"
"Practice basic dog obedience cues or tricks for high value-treats
"
" Other dogs may enjoy being pet, brushed, or massaged by their owners.
"
"You should also provide a place for your dog to hide. Play calming classical music and make sure the space is free of external stimulants (house traffic, other pets, etc.). You can also use dog pheromone sprays or plug-in diffusers to help reduce anxiety in that location.
"
"Some dogs may benefit from the use of natural supplements such as l-theanine or l-tryptophan. Both are ingredients that have a calming effect on animals.
"
"However, if your dog experiences intense panic attacks, where they are hurting themselves by trying to jump through windows or chewing or digging through the walls, they need to see their veterinarian to have antianxiety medications prescribed for them.
"
"Antianxiety medication can be used as needed. In some cases, a pet may benefit from a daily maintenance medication to keep them calmer overall.
"
"If your dog is experiencing panic attacks on a regular basis, then the maintenance medication can help them cope with these episodes. It may also reduce the frequency and duration of the panic attacks.
"
"Just like with humans, getting angry at someone who is experiencing panic will rarely resolve the issue. In most cases, it will only make it worse.
"
"So, yelling at your dog, spraying them with water, forcing them to lie down, or using a shock collar is not going to help a dog that’s experiencing a panic attack.
"
"These techniques will only increase fear and anxiety. Your dog cannot control their emotions or physiological responses in these scenarios. If they could control themselves and choose another option, they probably would.
"
"No one who has experienced a panic attack reported that it was a pleasant experience and wanted to experience another. Your dog needs your love and support to help them through their time of need.

"Urolithiasis is described as the presence of stones (calcium deposits) in the urinary tract. The development of these stones is more common in dogs than in cats, and in older animals. In most cases the stones can be removed safely, giving the animal a positive prognosis.
"
"The primary cause for the formation of stones is high levels of calcium in the urine. Some risk factors can include calcium supplements, excessive dietary protein or Vitamin D, high levels of steroids, Vitamin B6 deficient diets, and the consumption of dry food only diets.
"
"While these stones can occur in any breed, several dog breeds comprise over 60% of all cases. These breeds include Miniature Schnauzers, Lhapso Apsos, Yorkshire Terriers, Bichon Frises, Shih Tzu's and Miniature Poodles.
"
"Animals generally do not show signs of this issue, although trouble urinating is the most common symptom. If there is inflammation, an enlarged belly or the area surrounding the urinary region may be noticeable irritated. If the stones are large, they can sometimes be felt through the skin by a veterinarian.
"
"X-rays and ultrasounds are performed to determine any additional underlying medical conditions causing the animal pain or trouble urinating. Also, blood work will be done to examine levels of nutrients to see if any are outside of the normal range.
"
"
"
"One of the most common treatment options is the surgical removal of the stones. In some cases, shock waves can be used to help break up the stones. Also, depending on the size and severity of the stones, sometimes they can be flushed and massaged out of the animal's system with a catheter and fluids.
"
"It is important to reduce the animal's activity levels following surgery. Possible complications from the formation of these stones are the blockage of the urinary tract and the animal's inability to urinate. It is common for animals to re-form these calcium-based stones over time. Treatment on an ongoing basis will include the monitoring of calcium intake and the urinary patterns of the animal to observe if any problems develop.
"
"If surgery was used to remove the stones, post-surgical X-rays are recommended to ensure that the stones were completely removed. Ongoing X-rays can also be helpful in frequent intervals and if the formation of these calcium stones is detected, non-surgical techniques can be used to remove or dissolve them.
"
"The best prevention of recurrence is to monitor the animal's calcium levels on an ongoing basis so that adjustments can be made in the diet to maintain normal calcium levels.

"Pulmonary mineralization is characterized by both calcification (mineral calcium build up in soft tissue) and ossification (connective tissues, such as cartilage, are turned to bone or bone-like tissue) of the lungs.
"
"This condition generally affects older dogs and it may be generalized or localized. But if the mineralization is discrete, meaning that it in only one place, individual mineral deposits can be indentified. If mineralization is diffuse, however, it will spread out to more than one location, making it impossible to identify the individual deposits.
"
"Pulmonary mineralization can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Dogs with pulmonary mineralization may display no symptoms at all. However, some signs or symptoms that may be observed include:
"
"Calcification can be dystrophic (degenerative), which occurs secondary to tissue degeneration or inflammation, or it can be metastatic (transmissible throughout the body), which occurs secondary to metabolic disease, affecting the breakdown of food and its transformation into energy.
"
"Calcification may also be considered a normal part of the aging process, or with particular breeds (e.g., premature calcification of the tracheal and bronchial cartilages in chondrodystrophic [dwarf] breeds). Calcification is often associated with a wound, thus most focal calcifications are functionally unimportant.
"
"Ossification, also called heterotopic bone formation (the abnormal formation of true bone within extraskeletal soft tissues), can take different forms: calcification of a bony matrix (formative tissue), and pulmonary ossification in the form of small, multiple nodules.
"
"Generalized pulmonary mineralizations of unknown cause are reported in dogs under descriptive terms: pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis or pumice stone lung; bronchiolar microlithiasis; idiopathic pulmonary calcification; or idiopathic pulmonary ossification.
"
"The underlying cause for pulmonary fibrosis is usually unknown (idiopathic). However, it may be also due to:
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct a full physical examination, including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your veterinarian will conduct a lung biopsy to retrieve samples of tissue from your dog’s lungs in order to determine whether mineralization is occurring. Testing for the presence of bacteria and fungus will also be done.
"
"Other diagnostic tools include chest X-ray imaging of the chest, and a computed tomography (CT) scan, so that your veterinarian can get a better look at the condition of the lungs and lymph nodes. These tools will also help confirm or exclude the presence of a tumor or fungal infection.
"
"
"
"There are some medications that can relieve breathing problems, or antibiotics and antifungal medications, if your veterinarian determines that there is a concurrent infection.
"
"If there is an underlying metabolic disease, your doctor will prescribe medications for the treatment of that as well. Otherwise, all that is required is a a calm and quite space for your dog to recover.
"
"As with any disease of the respiratory system, this is a serious condition. You and your veterinarian will need to carefully monitor your dog’s progress.

"Hemangiopericytoma is malignant tumor that affects the cells surrounding the small blood vessels (capillaries) in subcutaneous tissue. A pericyte might best be described as a non-specialized cell. It is one of the original embryonic cells, but instead of taking on a specific function, it remains in its first stage, waiting until it is needed. The function of the pericyte is to differentiate into whatever type of cell the body requires to function, regenerating new tissue as needed. In this case, the pericyte is damaged by improper cell division, and instead of forming tissue that is useful to the body, it forms a tumor.
"
"Although a hemangiopericytoma does not usually spread throughout the body, it does grow continuously at the the site of origin. Over the course of several months to possibly years, this deeply rooted tumor grows until it has taken up the space in which it resides, affected the nearby organs and eventually impairing their function. This can be especially fatal when it occurs in the chest, close to the heart and lungs. Fortunately, this tumor has a high rate of successful treatment, but it must be treated before it has grown to unmanageable proportions. Although relatively rare, metastasis is reported in about 20 percent of patients. In dogs this tumor is more common in large-breeds than in small-breeds.
"
"The exact cause is still unknown.
"
"You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. After the initial background information has been noted, your veterinarian will perform complete physical examination, which will include routine laboratory tests: a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these tests are usually within normal ranges. A more definitive diagnosis will be based on the results of a biopsy analysis. Your veterinarian will take tissue a sample from the growing mass and examine it microscopically to confirm the diagnosis and determine the grade of the tumor. Your veterinarian may also take X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate the extent of the local metastasis and how deeply rooted the tumor is. These studies will be key in planning the surgery and ongoing therapy for your dog.
"
"
"
"Early and aggressive surgical excision of the affected tissue, along with some of the surrounding normal tissue remains the treatment of choice. A skilled veterinary surgeon will be called on to excise the affected area in order to enhance the chances of a complete removal of tumor. The removed tissue will be submitted to a veterinary pathologist for evaluation. Radiation therapy is generally highly successful with this type of tumor. You and your veterinarian will work together to decide if surgery along with radiation therapy is the best course of treatment for your dog.
"
"In many cases, recurrence is expected, as this type of cellular tumor has a high incidence of recrudescence. Your veterinarian will monitor the area in follow up visits, and if the hemangiopericytoma should recur, you doctor will explain the options to you so that you can make the treatment decision that is most appropriate for your dog.
"
"In some patients amputation of the affected limb is an option, as this will remove the entire affected area. Because this type of tumor usually remains local and does not spread out in the body, this can be a very effective method for resolving the issue. Another method is to remove the growth again. This method, along with radiotherapy, may be effective, especially for those patients in which complete removal of mass is not possible. The drawback is that if the tumor should return yet again, it will be more deeply rooted in the tissue, as each recurrence becomes more invasive than the last. The last method is to take no action at all. This may be the appropriate response, especially if your dog is older. The tumor grows at a slow rate and does not affect the animal's health until it has grown to a size where it is affecting the organs and/or limbs. Conversely, this may not be the appropriate response if your dog is young.
"
"The overall survival time largely depends upon the nature of the tumor and the aggressiveness with which surgery and treatment are conducted. A cure is possible in dogs that have undergone early and aggressive surgical resection of the tumor. Because recurrence of hemangiopericytoma is common, you will need to take your dog for regular follow up checkups or radiotherapy treatments. Your veterinarian will set up a schedule for progress evaluation visits.
"
"Your veterinarian will prescribe post-surgery pain killers for your dog to help make it more comfortable. Use pain medications with caution; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is due to overdose of medication. Cage rest is recommended after surgery. A quite area set aside, away from household traffic, active children and other pets will help your dog to recover. Also, setting the food dishes close by to where your dog is convalescing will allow your dog some independence. Outdoor trips, for when your dog needs to relieve itself, should be unhurried and close to home. Assist your dog as much as possible. If necessary, you might consider setting up a temporary area for your dog to relieve itself more comfortably, but consult your veterinarian first, as you may then need to break your dog from the new habit of relieving itself indoors.
"
"Keep in mind that you should not leave the dog alone for extended periods of time. Affection is a great help for recovery, and you will need to make sure that the dog is not laying in the same position for long. In case of limb amputation, most dogs recover well, learning to compensate for the lost limb.

"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare disease seen in dogs that involves the infiltration of the lungs by cancerous lymphoid cells (lymphocytes and plasma cells). Metastasis may occue in other body sites and organs like the liver, heart, spleen, pancreas, and kidney.
"
"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is not breed- or gender-specific, but is more common in large and purebred dogs.
"
"Respiratory symptoms are often seen which aggravate over time. The following are a few of the more common symptoms related to this disease:
"
"The underlying cause for lymphomatoid granulomatosis is currently unknown.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are usually non-specific and inconsistent with the disease.
"
"Blood testing, meanwhile, may reveal an abnormally high number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils (all types of white blood cells) in the blood. And X-rays will reveal details related to lung tissue and abnormalities. The attending veterinarian may also take a small lung tissue sample (biopsy) to be sent to veterinary pathologist for a definitive diagnosis.
"
"
"
"Unfortunately, there is no cure available. However, chemotherapy is often combined with surgical excision of the affected tissue. Regular blood testing, and cardiac and other body system evaluation are necessary during treatment.
"
"Because there is no cure available, you should talk to a veterinary oncologist for their best recommendations. Chemotherapeutic drugs are highly toxic to different body systems, and various complications are seen during and after treatment. Call your veterinarian immediately if you observe any untoward symptoms in your dog such as difficulty breathing, depression, or lack of appetite. In case of serious complications, your veterinarian may reduce dosages or stop the treatment altogether. In addition, chemotherapy medication is potentially hazardous to human health and should always be administered with the consent of a veterinary oncologist and kept in a secure place.

"Masses and lumps in dogs are relatively common, but not all of them are cancerous. When a mass isn’t cancer, it is referred to as benign. In most cases, benign masses grow more slowly and don’t spread to other parts of the body, so they don’t pose a serious health threat.
"
"By contrast, cancerous masses are characterized by cells that can multiply. They are known as malignant tumors and may grow rapidly—spreading to other organs and parts of the body, causing potentially serious health problems. How fast cancer grows and where it spreads depends on the type of cancer.
"
"Dogs, just like humans, can get cancer. In fact, about 25% of dogs will develop some form of cancer in their life and about 50% of dogs over the age of 10 will develop cancer. While not an exhaustive list, below are some of the more common types of cancers seen in dogs:
"
"Anal Sac Adenocarcinoma: This cancer affects the anal glands, which are scent glands located in the rectum­. It can metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body.
"
"Hemangiosarcoma: This tumor often arises from blood vessels, so it theoretically can arise anywhere. However, it is most found in the heart, liver or spleen. It is an aggressive type of cancer and has usually already spread by the time a diagnosis is made.
"
"Lymphoma: There are several types of lymphoma that dogs can get, but the most common affects the lymph nodes. It is one of the most common forms of cancer in dogs, but fortunately it is the type most responsive to chemotherapy.
"
"Mammary Gland Carcinoma: Female dogs have about five pairs of mammary glands, and these types of tumors are more common in unspayed females. Hormones like estrogen and progesterone play a role in mammary development and cancer formation.
"
"Mast Cell Tumor: This is the most common cancer of the skin, which can be difficult to determine with sight alone since the appearance can vary. These tumors have a variable prognosis and can range from low to high grade—meaning they are less likely or more likely to spread to other areas in the body.
"
"Melanoma: This type of cancer can occur on the skin or in the oral cavity; these tumors are typically malignant when found in the mouth and require aggressive surgery and/or combination of radiation and chemotherapy. They usually show signs associated with dental disease like bad breath and decreased appetite. 
"
"Osteosarcoma: This is the most common cause of bone cancer in dogs, which is highly aggressive and painful. This cancer commonly affects the legs of larger breeds of dogs.  Treatment often includes surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation.
"
"Transitional Cell Carcinoma: This is the most common type of urinary cancer, which usually affects the bladder the most and often causes symptoms similar to a urinary tract infection
"
"Dogs with cancer can show multiple symptoms. Some may have a lump or bump, new swelling, a wound that doesn’t heal, swollen lymph nodes, or abnormal bleeding. But many symptoms are nonspecific, including:
"
"Abdominal distension
"
"Behavioral changes or other neurological issues like seizures or head tilt
"
"Coughing or changes in respiration
"
"Decreased appetite and weight loss
"
"Exercise intolerance
"
"Pale gums
"
"Lethargy
"
"Vomiting and/or diarrhea
"
"If you are even slightly worried about your pup—especially if you notice a change in behavior or find a new lump—schedule an appointment with your veterinarian for an exam.
"
"Cancer often occurs for unknown reasons and can be influenced by many factors, including: 
"
"Age
"
"Viruses and infections
"
"Chemical and toxin exposure
"
"Genetics
"
"DNA mutations
"
"UV damage or other environmental triggers
"
"Cancerous lumps cannot be distinguished from benign, non-cancerous lumps based on visual appearance alone, so don’t try to self-diagnose at home. Lumps vary in size, shape, and appearance; some may feel firm and immovable, whereas others may feel soft and pliable. Some may appear hairless or pigmented, and others ulcerated; some may be painful when touched, and others not; some may be felt underneath the skin, and others may be felt above the skin.
"
"It’s important to differentiate lumps from lymph nodes, as dogs have multiple pairs of lymph nodes (underneath the jaw, in front of the shoulders, under the armpits, and behind the knees) that can typically be felt as small, oval-shaped, non-painful swellings underneath the skin. Lymph nodes can become enlarged and may be a symptom of cancer. If you find a new lump or bump on your dog, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis.   
"
"A physical exam is used to look for any abnormal or unexplained lumps, bruises, or masses large enough to be felt during palpation (pressing on the surface of the body to feel the organs or tissues underneath). Your veterinarian may want to perform an FNA (fine-needle aspirate) of the mass, where a sample of the tumor is collected and submitted for analysis. Alternatively, a biopsy (larger sample of tumor collected, usually under heavy sedation or anesthesia) may be performed and studied for type, malignancy, and grade. All of this provides insight into how the cancer may progress—either aggressively or not.
"
"Bloodwork and urine testing usually follows to look for signs that may narrow the problem to a specific organ or body system. Imaging with radiographs or ultrasound may also be recommended to screen for masses in the chest or abdomen. 
"
"Once diagnosed, your veterinarian may recommend additional tests or refer you to an oncologist for further testing and treatment, including staging (staging determines the extent the cancer has spread). This may include CT scans, bone marrow aspirates, or additional biopsies.
"
"The prognosis will vary depending on the type of cancer and it is influenced by grade and stage. Usually, the higher the grade and greater the stage the worse the prognosis. 
"
"Generally, there are three options for cancer treatment in dogs—surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Some cancers may respond to one type of treatment, while others may require a combination of some or all to arrive at a favorable prognosis. Unfortunately, a full cure is difficult to find. Some chemotherapy medications often used include:
"
"Carboplatin
"
"Chlorambucil
"
"Cyclophosphamide
"
"Doxorubicin
"
"L-asparaginase
"
"Lomustine
"
"Mitoxantrone
"
"Palladia
"
"Prednisone
"
"Vinblastine
"
"Vincristine
"
"Treating and managing cancer in dogs is different than treating cancer in humans, as there are different goals and expectations. The goal is to maintain a good quality of life, and drug dosages and frequency of administration are often less than what a human would be prescribed, which minimizes side effects. The most common in dogs are decreased appetite, lethargy, vomiting, or diarrhea, although serious side effects such as bone marrow suppression and infections can occur. With few breed exceptions, dogs do not lose their hair.
"
"While they are on chemotherapy, it is important to keep your dog comfortable and manage their pain appropriately. This means an effective partnership with your veterinarian, adhering to proper appointment recommendations, and following through with bloodwork monitoring and other testing. 
"
"Caring for a dog with cancer is a challenge and can be burdensome and emotional, but remember to take advantage of each day’s opportunities for play, bonding, and love. 
"
"Knowing when it is time to stop treatment or consider euthanasia is both variable and individual for all pets and pet parents. Many factors such as prognosis, metastasis, risks of treatment, cost, and quality of life are often considered. But when it comes to quality of life, which can be subjective, keep in mind the 5 Freedoms:
"
"Freedom from hunger and thirst
"
"Freedom from discomfort
"
"Freedom from pain, injury, and disease
"
"Freedom to express normal behavior
"
"Freedom from fear and distress
"
"Your veterinarian is the best resource when it comes to knowing when it “is time.” Your vet is trained in end-of-life care and disease outcomes, and there are many resources and tools that can help when it comes to making this difficult decision. 
"
"Unfortunately, there is very little a pet parent can do to prevent most cancers from occurring. Routine checkups and evaluation of any new lumps or unexplained illness(es) should immediately prompt a veterinary visit. Limit sun and UV exposure, have your dog spayed/neutered, and if your dog is a breed predisposed to certain tumors, more frequent screenings are recommended.
"
"Your dog should be provided an annual exam every year with your veterinarian, but senior dogs should have more frequent visits as needed (especially if they are managing an underlying condition). Mast cell tumors can develop quickly and can change size fast, so it’s critical to schedule an appointment as soon as you discover any new lumps or bumps.  
"
"In general, a tumor and a mass are terms used interchangeably. It’s important to note that both terms don’t always indicate cancer, as some tumors can be benign and some masses can occur as the result of an injury or infection (abscess).

"The Bulldog, commonly called the English Bulldog, is well known for their wide stance; muscular low profile; and short, wrinkled face with an underbite. Though short (at only 14–15 inches tall), Bulldogs weigh a sturdy 40–50 pounds. They have drooping lips with many loose skin wrinkles and folds throughout their face and neck.
"
"The dogs unfortunately got their start as bull-baiters and butcher’s dogs, according to the Bulldog Club of America. But after generations of selective breeding, they’re now calm—even lazy—dogs that serve as four-legged companions.
"
"
"
"The English Bulldog typically displays a friendly temperament and can make a great family dog. But they need the right family to thrive in, and potential pet parents need to know what to expect before bringing home a Bulldog puppy.
"
"As a brachycephalic (short-nosed) breed, English Bulldogs are not well-adapted to hot climates. When it’s hot, ensure your Bulldog has access to shade, water, and AC at all times, and restrict any neighborhood walks to cooler times of the day (morning and evening).
"
"Their short snouts also mean this breed is not known for being particularly quiet—there’s lots of panting, snorting, and snoring. Their wrinkly skin will also require frequent maintenance to prevent skin infections.
"
"The average English Bulldog lifespan is 8–10 years, shorter than average for a medium-sized dog breed. The unique physical traits of the Bulldog make the breed predisposed to an array of medical concerns.
"
"The short face, sensitivity to temperature extremes, excessive skin folds, and elevated hip position (above the shoulder line) can all lead to medical issues. Some of these problems may require lifelong treatment or surgical correction, so this dog breed can become expensive. Pet insurance is a great option if you’re considering adding a Bulldog to your family.
"
"Bulldogs commonly have brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS). This condition is caused by a combination of anatomical abnormalities that can be present due to the breed’s flat face, including:
"
"Narrowed nose openings
"
"Elongated soft palate in the mouth
"
"Swelling in the larynx
"
"Compressed/distorted nasal passages
"
"All of this leads to difficulty breathing and a propensity to overheat. The characteristic snorting and snoring noises from the English Bulldog are also caused by their brachycephalic face. Excessive weight can make symptoms worse, so it’s important to keep your Bulldog fit and healthy. Some Bulldogs even need surgical correction of these anatomic abnormalities to live a healthy life.
"
"The excessive skin wrinkles throughout a Bulldog’s face and neck can cause skin issues. Any time an English Bulldog gets wet, their wrinkles can trap moisture if they are not properly dried. The warm, moist environment provides the perfect habitat for bacteria and/or yeast growth—commonly referred to as skin fold pyoderma.
"
"To help prevent skin fold pyoderma, it’s important to always clean with a medicated wipe and properly dry the skin folds. This keeps bacteria and yeast from building up and prevents moisture from becoming trapped.
"
"Allergies also commonly affect Bulldogs, which can lead to skin infection and pyoderma as well. Environmental allergies, food allergies, and flea and insect allergies can all cause skin issues. Depending on the allergy, your dog may require a special diet, medication, or medicated shampoo to help manage and alleviate symptoms.
"
"It’s extremely common for Bulldogs to develop hip dysplasia, a condition in which the hip joint does not function properly.
"
"Because the English Bulldog’s hip joints are elevated above shoulder height, the abnormal position causes the thigh bone (femur) to fit awkwardly in the pelvis at the hip joint. This abnormal position creates an unstable hip joint, which can lead to arthritis and possible bone fractures over time.
"
"There is testing available (PennHIP screening) to detect the likelihood that a dog will develop hip dysplasia in their lifetime. Reputable English Bulldog breeders will screen their dogs for this genetic condition.
"
"If your Bulldog is diagnosed with hip dysplasia, there are a few options for treatment and long-term management including medications, joint supplements, and surgery. Weight management is also important, because any excess weight will exacerbate the issue and increase discomfort for the dog.
"
"The English Bulldog can develop entropion, which is the inward rolling-in of the eyelids (usually the lower eyelids). This condition causes the outer hair of the eyelid to make contact with the surface of the eyeball. Entropion can irritate the eye, causing redness, pain, swelling, and discharge.
"
"While eye products including artificial tears and pain medication can help these symptoms, surgery is usually needed for permanent relief.
"
"The English Bulldog is prone to obesity, and the extra weight can exacerbate other health concerns.
"
"To help prevent unnecessary weight gain, be diligent about the type and amount of food you give your Bulldog. This is extremely important for all dog breeds, but especially for Bulldogs. These flat-faced dogs are sensitive to heat and prone to breathing difficulties, so exercise can be difficult for them.
"
"Due to their short and stocky nature, it’s important to keep Bulldogs at a healthy weight.
"
"English Bulldog puppies less than 1 year old should be fed a high-quality puppy food approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Older English Bulldogs (7 years old and older) should be offered a high-quality senior dog food that is also AAFCO-approved.
"
"There are some dog foods on the market that are specifically formulated for Bulldogs. These breed-specific diets offer a special dry kibble shape for easier eating and certain ingredients to promote gastrointestinal, joint, and skin health. Talk to your vet to find the best food for English Bulldogs.
"
"Bulldogs can be very food-motivated, so overfeeding or offering excessive amounts of treats during the day should be avoided. Treats should never be more than 10% of their daily intake—and if your pup is overweight, cutting out most treats is recommended.
"
"As with most dog breeds, it’s appropriate to feed an adult Bulldogs twice a day, in morning and evening. English Bulldog puppies need to eat more frequently (about three or four times daily).
"
"Some English Bulldogs may require a slow feeder bowl so they don’t eat too quickly, which can result in regurgitation or aspiration pneumonia. You can also use puzzle toys, which require your dog to think and interact with the feeder to get to their kibble. This can be a great form of mental stimulation.
"
"In general, the amount of dog food offered should be based on the ideal weight of your dog. The AAFCO-approved dog food packaging will give you feeding guidelines, and your veterinarian can help tailor recommended portion sizes to your specific Bulldog based on their age, lifestyle, and health.
"
"Because of their health considerations, there are many dog supplements that can help maintain the overall health of your Bulldog. These include:
"
"Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oil and in some dog food formulas
"
"Joint supplements that contain glucosamine
"
"Probiotics
"
"Immune-boosting supplements, which can also help dogs with allergies (most contain fish oils as well)
"
"Talk with your veterinarian to learn which supplements make the most sense for your English Bulldog.
"
"The English Bulldog is typically friendly, loyal, and good with other pets and children. The official breed standard refers to the Bulldog as “equable and kind, resolute and courageous.” Like every dog, Bulldogs need to be well-trained and socialized to be confident and well-mannered.
"
"Despite their reputation for being lazy, Bulldogs benefit from daily exercise. They typically don’t need a significant amount of exercise, but it can be helpful—especially in those that are overweight.
"
"Bulldogs that are prone to or have been diagnosed with brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome might not tolerate any exercise without having breathing issues. For these dogs, short, leashed walks in a cool environment are recommended, 10–15 minutes at a time. If temperatures are too hot outside, a game of fetch inside or a puzzle toy will also suffice.
"
"Although the English Bulldog is quite docile, they can be curious in new situations and be reserved around strangers. However, they are affectionate toward those they know and love.
"
"Bulldogs aren’t known to be excessive barkers or diggers, but boredom can lead to destructive behaviors. Make sure your dog has enough mental stimulation and attention.
"
"Begin training and socializing your English Bulldog puppy as soon as you bring them home. Like all dogs, Bulldogs respond best to positive reinforcement training. Just be mindful about how many treats you’re giving your dog during training sessions, as treats can lead to unwanted weight gain. Treats should never make up more than 10% of your dog’s daily calorie intake.

"
"The English Bulldog has a short, smooth hair coat with a moderate shedding level. Their coats can come in a wide range of colors and combinations: red, white, fawn, or brindle, to name just a few.
"
"Whether you have a white English Bulldog or a brindle English Bulldog, their wrinkly skin requires frequent and time-consuming grooming. To help keep their dog healthy, pet parents need to be diligent and thorough about their skin and coat care.
"
"The skin wrinkles and folds around a Bulldog’s face, neck, and tail should be evaluated and cleaned daily. Use a soft, dry cloth or dog-friendly wipe to gently wipe out debris. It’s important that you fully dry wrinkles after cleaning to prevent the growth of bacteria in trapped moisture.
"
"English Bulldogs should be bathed once a week to every other week, with special attention given to their skin wrinkles/folds. Be sure that skin wrinkles are clear of debris and gently dried with a soft cloth after bathing or splashing in water to prevent skin infection.
"
"Brushing your English Bulldog once a week with a soft bristle brush is recommended to help maintain a healthy coat.
"
"Because English Bulldogs can be prone to eye issues or allergies that cause eye discharge, you may need to clean around their eyes routinely. This can be done using pet-safe wipes—but again, make sure that you always fully dry the skin after cleaning.
"
"Talk to your vet if you notice any changes in your dog’s eyes.
"
"After every bath, clean your Bulldog’s ears with a veterinary-recommended cleaner to prevent ear infections. 
"
"If you’re considering bringing home a Bulldog, there are some major considerations. Namely, the breeds’ potential health issues, sensitivity to heat, weight management requirements, and grooming needs. 
"
"These considerations are important because they can greatly affect the overall lifestyle of the English Bulldog. They may require lifelong medical care and may ultimately need surgical intervention or a referral to a specialist veterinarian to fully alleviate these medical issues.
"
"However, pet parents who are knowledgeable about the breed and ready to meet a Bulldog’s needs will find a loving companion.
"
"The typical English Bulldog life expectancy is 8–10 years.
"
"Yes! Most socialized English Bulldogs make excellent family companions, especially with children and other pets.
"
"Absolutely. Don’t let their easygoing behavior fool you; Bulldogs do well with training and they are loyal to their pet parents.
"
"When purchased through a breeder, English Bulldog puppies can cost as much as several thousand dollars. However, there are English Bulldog rescue organizations that have dogs available for adoption at lower costs. Likewise, some animal shelters may have English Bulldog puppies and adults available for adoption.
"
"English Bulldogs and French Bulldogs share similarities but are different breeds. An easy way to differentiate the two is their ears: the Frenchie has large, perky ears that stand straight up on their head, while the English Bulldog’s ears are smaller and folded over. French Bulldogs are also smaller and slimmer than English Bulldogs. 
"
"At 60–100 pounds, American Bulldogs are much larger than English Bulldogs. They also have very different energy levels—American Bulldogs are active and love exercise, while English Bulldogs tend to be more content with snoozing on the couch.
"
"No, English Bulldogs are not the same as Old English Bulldogs. Old English Bulldogs (or Olde English Bulldogges) are not recognized by the American Kennel Club, but they are recognized by the United Kennel Club, which says they’ve been bred to closely resemble the English Bulldog’s ancestors.

"Breeding timing refers to the purposeful timing of insemination during the estrus period—commonly refrred to as being ""in heat""—in order to maximize fertility and the chances of conception. This technique may be utilized to ensure conception in dogs.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"In order to maximize the odds of conception with properly timed breeding in dogs, it is best to pin-point, as closely as possible, the day of ovulation for the female dog—more commonly referred to as a bitch, which is the correct terminology. Symptoms of estrus-onset in the bitch are evidenced by swelling in the vulva and the appearance of a clear to brownish vaginal discharge. The male animal, or stud, will show interest in the female, and she may exhibit “flagging,” by which she will respond to being stroked at the genital region by elevating the tail to one side. A vaginal exam, however, serves as a better indicator of a fertile period than the aforementioned physical and behavioral signs.
"
"Breeding timing and related fertility-maximizing techniques may be utilized for a number of reasons. This may be deemed necessary if there is an apparent failure to achieve conception in the female dog.
"
"The most reliable method of determining the ovulation cycle is via vaginal exam and vaginoscopy in order to examine the vaginal lining and determine if the bitch is in estrus. Hormone levels, such as LH, and progesterone, will be tested to determine when fertility levels are peaking. Additionally, an ultrasound of the ovaries may help verify ovulation.
"
"
"
"To maximize fertility when breeding dogs, it is necessary to estimate the female's day of ovulation. Because of this, a luteinizing hormone (LH) may be given to female dogs in order to control ovulation and regulate the bitch’s cycle, allowing breeding to be timed accordingly. The period of maximum fertility occurs approximately five to six days after the LH peaks. In this time, multiple breedings may be done by inseminating the bitch up to three times per week after progesterone levels rise. Frozen semen, though less likely to work than fresh chilled semen, may be used to inseminate the bitch – a single insemination five or six days after LH hormones peak is common. It is important to time insemination based on progesterone levels in order to improve chances of conception.
"
"After initial fertility-maximizing measures have been taken, a follow up pregnancy examination can be done to determine the success of the procedure. This can be done via vaginal specimens. The gestation period for dogs lasts approximately 63 days from ovulation.
"
"Age related factors may make conception more difficult for older animals.

"Cerebellar hypoplasia is a condition in which parts of the cerebellum have not completely developed. The cerebellum makes up a large part of the brain, lying under the cerebrum and toward the back, above and behind the brainstem. This condition can occur due to intrinsic (genetic) causes, or to extrinsic causes like infections, toxins or nutritional deficiencies. Symptoms become visible when the puppies begin to stand and walk, around six weeks of age. Cerebellar hypoplasia is hereditary in Airedales, Chow Chows, Boston Terriers, and Bull Terrier breeds.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. If you can provide any information on your dog's birth, or on the condition of the mother, it may help your veterinarian to pinpoint the cause of the defect. Your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical exam with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis.
"
"Animals affected with cerebellar hypoplasia show signs at birth or shortly thereafter.  Puppies may show a slow progression of signs over weeks to months.  After postnatal onset of signs of cerebellar hypoplasia, these patients should not show any further progression of signs.  Age, breed, history and typical non-progressive symptoms are usually sufficient for tentative diagnosis.
"
"  
"
"
"
"There is no treatment for cerebellar hypoplasia. While these signs are permanent, they typically do not worsen and affected dogs have normal lifespans.
"
"Necrotizing encephalitis is inflammation of the brain with concurrent necrosis (death) of brain tissue. It is seen only in a few breeds of dogs, including pugs, Yorkshire terriers, and Maltese. It is also occasionally seen in chihuahuas and shi-tzus. Symptoms vary in different breeds.
"
"Symptoms depend on the area of the brain that is affected, but may include:
"
"The exact cause for this condition is unknown.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a detailed medical history, including a background of the symptoms, time of onset, and the frequency of the symptoms present. After taking a history, your veterinarian will examine your dog in detail. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The laboratory tests are usually within normal ranges. Radiographic studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a computed tomography scan (CT-scan) also typically give non-specific results.
"
"A more conclusive diagnosis may be made using a sample taken from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the protective and nourishing fluid that circulate around the brain and spinal cord. The sample will be sent to laboratory for a further evaluation. The results of the CSF testing may reveal an increase in the leukocytes (white blood cells or WBCs) count, an abnormal condition referred to as pleocytosis. The laboratory tests may also indicate inflammation, infection, or the possible presence of a tumor. However, a brain biopsy (taking a small sample of brain tissue for analysis) is the only way to conclusively determine the cause for the brain disturbance.
"
"
"
"Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available, and treatment that is given is primarily for the reduction of symptoms. Medicines to reduce inflammation in the brain, or to reduce the over-reactivity of the immune system can be used, but otherwise there is no clear-cut treatment. Your veterinarian may also suggest treatment to control seizures.
"
"Unfortunately, there is no treatment yet available for this disease. Some drugs may help in reducing the symptoms but an ultimate cure is not possible. This disease is chronic in nature and symptoms are usually progressive in nature.
"
"Your dog may require long-term treatment. If so, you will be dispensing medication to your dog at home. Always follow proper medication guidelines, including exact dosage and frequency of medications. Over dosage of medications is one of the most preventable causes of death in pets. Your will need to stay in regular contact with your veterinarian, as adjustments to the dosage will be made over time as the inflammation in the brain lessens. Your veterinarian will set up a clinic schedule for your dog in order to monitor treatment response and make adjustments to medication and home therapy as necessary.

"Your dog will be developmentally disabled, so it will not be able to make decisions to protect itself as other dogs do. You will need to restrict your dog's activity and movement  so as to prevent injuries and road accidents. Climbing, falling, or freedom of movement at the park, all of the normal things that dogs do, will need to be prevented with your dog.  In the case of severely brain deficient animals that are unable to feed or groom themselves, or to be house trained, euthanasia may be considered.

"Not only is breaking a bone a traumatic experience for your dog, the recuperation and stress involved make it one of the most challenging medical conditions. Broken bones in dogs are most often caused by falls, motor vehicle accidents, gunshot injuries, or cancer. 
"
"When there is excessive force against a bone, exceeding its core strength, a break or fracture occurs. Most breaks occur in the hindlimb. The femur is the bone most often fractured, followed by the tibia and fibula, then the radius, ulna, and humerus of the forelimb. Pelvic fractures and fractures involving the mandible are also common, though less frequent.
"
"There are many different types of breaks and fractures that can occur in any bone of the body, and any fracture can also be a combination of one or more of the types listed below:
"
"Incomplete—Only one side of the bone is broken, or there is a partial break or bending of the bone.
"
"Complete—Both sides of the bone are broken.
"
"Comminuted—The bone has broken into at least three fragments.
"
"Open—Often seen with other wounds, but one in which the bone is exposed to the outside environment.
"
"Closed—Often referred to as an internal fracture, this occurs when there is no exposure to the outside environment.
"
"Salter-Harris—This kind of fracture goes through the growth plate of the bone.
"
"Articular—This is a fracture that involves the joint.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Most broken bones occur after some sort of activity or accident. Not only will there be signs of a broken bone, as noted below, but there may be other injuries that can be attributed to the accident. For instance, a dog that has been hit by a car may have a broken leg but also experience internal bleeding and have difficulty breathing.
"
"Signs most often associated with broken bones in dogs include:
"
"Lameness, often seen with the affected limb held up
"
"Pain
"
"Joint swelling
"
"Crepitus (crunching within the joint) or increased looseness of the limb
"
"Abnormal conformation (angularity or shortening) of the affected limb
"
"Broken bone protruding from the skin
"
"Swelling or bruising of the limb/body part
"
"If you determine or suspect that your dog has a fracture, seek emergency veterinary medical care immediately. The fracture needs to be supported properly and the dog confined. Attempting to reduce the fracture yourself is not recommended and can certainly make matters worse.
"
"The first thing to do is to move your dog gently and safely out of harm’s way while doing your best not to manipulate the fracture. Do not attempt to give any medications or clean the area unless directed to do so by your veterinarian. Take precautions like placing a muzzle on your dog prior to transporting to the vet, as a dog in pain may bite.
"
"Diagnosis of a broken bone is most often straightforward and almost always involves a physical exam followed by radiographs. Treatment, unfortunately, is not as simple as the type is often determined by three factors:
"
"The patient—Young or old? Healthy or affected by multiple comorbidities?
"
"The environment—Can the dog be confined and supervised?
"
"The injury—Type, severity, location, etc.
"
"The first step after stabilizing your dog is to immobilize the affected segments so it cannot move or cause further trauma to any surrounding structures. This often means heavy sedation or anesthesia followed by one of these four options:
"
"External coaptation (casts and splints) may be an option in younger dogs, or dogs with stable fractures or for fractures that occur below the knee and elbow. 
"
"Intramedullary fixation with pins, rods, wires, and/or nails is the most common option.
"
"External skeletal fixation requires a device attached externally (outside of) the bone via pins, wires, etc. is often the best option for open and comminuted fractures.
"
"Plates and screws are directly attached onto the bone.
"
"Breaks or fractures that are associated with the joint where there are multiple open segments located in a major weight-bearing bone or digit are most often treated surgically. These types of fractures occur in larger breeds, or athletic dogs. Small-breed dogs will often require surgery, as its bones lack sufficient blood vessels for the healing process.
"
"Casts and splints are often less expensive, usually priced between $100 to $300. However, there are additional costs to consider if this method is a suitable treatment option. This includes the cost of re-check appointments, bandage care, and reapplication—in addition to home care, vigilance, and time required to care for the bandage itself.
"
"Depending on where you live and the facility performing the surgery, you may expect to spend several hundred to several thousand dollars in care for your pooch. Seek the advice of a veterinary surgeon to determine the best course of treatment. Amputation, although extreme, may have its practicality in certain cases.
"
"Failure to treat a broken or fractured bone can leave your dog in a lot of pain and discomfort, and at risk of infection and whole-body sepsis; delayed union (longer timeline expected for the normal healing process); malunion (bones are healed but in an abnormal position); nonunion (fracture not resolved); and even angular limb deformities and long-term arthritis and joint disease.
"
"Bones can heal on their own; however, there is a significant concern for malalignment or malunion, not to mention the risks of further instability, worsening of the fracture site, and prolonged pain and suffering.
"
"Broken bones usually heal within three to four months for adult dogs and one to two months for puppies. It’s important to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines throughout the healing process, as multiple re-checks with repeat radiographs are often needed to ensure that the bone is healing as expected, as well as to reshape or mold the cast and change the bandage, if present. Adhere to all the recheck appointments and give the dog all medications as prescribed which include pain medications, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics.
"
"Your dog’s activity will most likely be restricted—no jumping, running, or playing. For limb and pelvic fractures, you may initially need to aid your dog when it stands or walks by utilizing a harness or a rolled towel underneath its chest or pelvis.
"
"At some point during the recuperation process, physical therapy and rehabilitation will most likely be recommended to strengthen muscles, tendons, and improve function and overall comfort. Do your best to adhere to these recommendations and at-home exercises. A soft and well-padded bed can really improve your recuperating dog’s comfort and emotional well-being.
"
"If your dog is wearing a bandage, be sure to always keep it clean and dry. Do not attempt to change the bandage at home but do monitor the bandage at least daily for signs of slippage, soiling, swelling of the distal extremities, and increased irritation by the dog (such as attempts to chew, lick, or scratch). All can be signs that the bandage needs to be changed.

"A tumor is an abnormal growth of body tissue. Tumors can occur in nearly any part of a dog’s body, including the brain. There are two broad categories of tumors:  benign (not cancer) and malignant (cancer). Brain tumors are classified as primary or secondary.
"
"Primary brain tumor: A primary brain tumor is one that originated in the brain or in one of the layers covering the brain, called the meninges.
"
"Secondary brain tumor: A secondary brain tumor is one that has spread to or invaded the brain after starting in another location. This can happen either by metastasis or by invasion. Metastasis occurs when tumor cells break off from a primary tumor, travel through the body, and establish themselves elsewhere. Invasion occurs when a tumor extends into neighboring bodily tissues.
"
"Seizures (the most common symptom)
"
"Sensitivity to touch on the head or neck area
"
"Issues with vision
"
"Uncoordinated or unsteady movement
"
"Abnormal behaviors, such as repetitive circling
"
"Increased reactivity
"
"Lethargy or excessive tiredness
"
"Lack of appetite
"
"Head tilt
"
"Inability to control urination or bowel movements
"
"There are no known direct causes of brain tumors in dogs. Research suggests that a combination of factors, such as diet, surrounding environment, genetics, and immune system health, may be involved. Brain tumors can occur at any age but typically happen in dogs over the age of 5.
"
"Certain breeds with particular head and nose shapes appear to be more at risk for developing brain tumors than others, including:
"
"Dolichocephalic dog breeds: These are breeds with an elongated head and nose. Examples include the Collie, Greyhound, Dachshund, Italian Greyhound, and Great Dane. These breeds are more likely to develop meningioma, a type of brain tumor that develops in the membranes surrounding the brain.
"
"Brachycephalic dog breeds: These are breeds with a shorter nose and flatter face. Examples include the Pug, Shih Tzu, Bulldog, Boxer, Boston Terrier, Pekingese, and Mastiff, among others. These breeds are more likely to develop glioma, a type of tumor that originates in the brain or spinal cord.
"
"A brain tumor may be suspected in older dogs based on abnormal neurological signs. The veterinarian will start with a thorough physical examination and will test for any sign that something may be affecting your dog’s brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
"
"Bloodwork such as a complete blood count and serum blood chemistry will likely be performed to rule out other causes of seizures or abnormal behavior. Routine bloodwork cannot diagnose a brain tumor but can eliminate other possible causes of your dog’s symptoms. 
"
"Chest X-rays and abdominal ultrasound will likely be recommended to see if the cancer has spread. Approximately 55% of brain tumors do not start in the brain, but instead spread there from another location. Even if the brain tumor is a primary tumor, it may have spread to other locations.
"
"Imaging of the brain is needed to confirm that a brain tumor is present. X-rays cannot penetrate the skull bone enough to visualize the brain. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are needed to image the brain and locate the tumor. Dogs will be given general anesthesia for CTs or MRIs to make sure they do not move during the procedure. CTs and MRIs are typically performed by a veterinary neurologist.
"
"The veterinarian may suspect the type of tumor present based on the appearance of a mass on the CT or MRI, but a biopsy is necessary to identify the type of tumor. Other diseases can look like tumors or cancer on a CT or MRI include abscesses, parasites ( such as toxoplasmosis), cysts, blood clots, and inflammatory lesions.
"
"Your veterinarian or veterinary neurologist will discuss the best treatment plan for your dog if they are diagnosed with a brain tumor, depending on the type of tumor and whether it has metastasized. 
"
"There are three primary treatment options: surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.
"
"Surgery: The goal of surgery is to remove the brain tumor. This is often not possible unless it is located on the brain’s surface. Surgery is more likely to be successful for dogs diagnosed with meningioma; however, it is likely that the tumor will recur. This is a highly specialized procedure performed only by a veterinary neurosurgeon.  Dogs with tumors located deeper in the brain are not good candidates for surgery because of complications that can arise from cutting through healthy brain tissue to reach the tumor site.
"
"Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy is commonly used to target and shrink brain tumors. Radiation can cause negative side effects such as nausea, mouth ulcers, and ear infections, but these can be treated with medication. Radiation can quickly improve your dog’s condition, but it rarely destroys the entire tumor. On average, brain tumors treated with radiation will recur in eight to 14 months.
"
"Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is not a common option for treating brain tumors in dogs.
"
"The brain is protected by a network of blood vessels that serve as a barrier to keep dangerous substances out. The body interprets chemotherapy drugs as being harmful and prevents them from reaching the brain, and therefore the tumor, in large amounts.
"
"Medication: Medications may be used as a solo treatment to keep your dog comfortable and increase their quality of life or they may be used with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Common medications may include steroids to help slow the growth of the tumor and decrease swelling in the brain, as well as anti-seizure medications to control seizures secondary to the brain tumor.
"
"Dogs diagnosed with a brain tumor will need ongoing care with their veterinary neurologist. This is because a brain tumor can rarely be cured and will likely recur even when fully removed with surgery or destroyed with radiation.
"
"Routine exams are important for increasing your dog’s lifespan while maintaining their quality of life. These exams often include imaging and an evaluation of symptoms common for dogs with brain tumors, such as seizures.
"
"Dog parents also need to be on the lookout for other complications. For example, brain tumors can increase pressure on your dog’s skull and make it more difficult for them to swallow. This can cause them to accidentally inhale food or water into the lungs, which can lead to an infection in the lungs called aspiration pneumonia.
"
"Medications will likely be prescribed for the remainder of your dog’s life. These can help to manage symptoms as well as the brain tumor itself. For example, anti-inflammatory medication can help reduce swelling and pressure, and anti-seizure medication can help control and prevent seizures.
"
"The life expectancy of a dog with a brain tumor varies by tumor location and treatment. Dogs with a tumor in the lower region of the brain have a shorter life expectancy than those with a tumor in the upper region.
"
"The following shows life expectancy time frames based on the treatment received:
"
"Supportive care only: two to four months
"
"Surgery: six to 12 months
"
"Chemotherapy: seven to 11 months
"
"Radiation: seven to 24 months
"
"Surgery with radiation: six to 30 months
"
"Research has shown that brain tumors occur in about 15 of every 100,000 dogs. They make up 2–5% of all cancers diagnosed in dogs. Some breeds may be more likely to develop brain tumors than others.
"
"Some brain tumors are classified as slow-growing over the course of months and years, while others develop quickly and aggressively.

"Dogs can incur brain injuries from a variety of causes, including severe hyperthermia or hypothermia and prolonged seizures. Primary brain injuries, for example, involve direct trauma to the brain, which once acquired, cannot be altered. Secondary brain injury, meanwhile, is the alteration of brain tissue that occurs after primary injury, but this form of injury can be managed, prevented, and improved with optimal supportive care and treatment.
"
"Being that it is a vital organ, the brain requires constant supply of oxygen and nutrition. Any deficiency of oxygen or direct trauma to the brain, therefore, may result in bleeding and fluid buildup, which can cause excessive pressure on the brain. This in turn can cause complications involving the heart, eye, and several other body systems. Symptoms vary and depend on the cause and severity of the brain injury. Some of the more common symptoms include:
"
"The following are some of the more common causes to brain injuries:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated the unusual behaviors or complications. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count. Although the findings for these tests depend on the underlying cause of the brain injury, often the biochemistry profile may indicate abnormalities in the blood glucose level. Blood gases are also measured to confirm oxygen deficiency in the blood.
"
"When fractures involving the skull are suspected, X-rays, CT (computed tomography) scans, and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) are extremely useful to evaluate the severity of the brain trauma. These diagnostic tools also help in determining the presence of bleeding, fractures, foreign bodies, tumor, and other abnormalities involving brain. The ECG (electrocardiogram), meanwhile, is used to evaluate heart functions and rhythm.
"
"Your veterinarian may also collect cerebrospinal fluid sample to determine the level of inflammation and to confirm possible infections.
"
"
"
"Any type of brain injury should be considered an emergency that requires immediate hospitalization for intensive care and treatment. In fact, depending on the cause of the brain injury, surgery may be required. However, often the primary goal of emergency treatment is to normalize the dog's temperature and blood pressure, provide adequate levels of oxygen and prevent hypoxia.
"
"In order to assist with breathing, a tube will be passed into the trachea to supply oxygen. Small amounts of fluids may also be given to animals with fluid deficits in order to maintain blood pressure. To reduce brain swelling, the dog will be given medication and its head will be kept above the level of the body. In addition, the dog is turned over every two hours to avoid complications.

"Eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis is a condition that causes the inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, and their membranes due to abnormally high numbers of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Often, the increase of eosinophils is in response to a parasite infection, tumor or allergic reaction in the dog.
"
"Although dogs of any age may succumb to eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis, Golden retrievers seem to be predisposed to the condition.
"
"Symptoms vary in location and severity, but are often related to the nervous system such as circling, loss of memory, seizures and blindness.
"
"It is common for the underlying cause to the eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis to be idiopathic (or unknown) in nature. Other typical factors associated with this disease include:&lt;
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination and several laboratory tests -- such as complete blood count (CBC), blood culture biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- to help identify and isolate the cause of inflammation.
"
"Blood testing may reveal abnormally high number of eiosinophils in the blood. Biochemistry profiling, for example, may show abnormal liver enzyme activity, indicating parasitic infections. And magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal tumorous lesions in the dog's brain or spinal cord.
"
"One of the most important diagnostic tests, however, is CSF (or cerebrospinal fluid) analysis. A sample of your dog's CSF will be collected and sent to a laboratory for culturing and further evaluation. In case of idiopathic or allergic causes, abnormally high numbers of eiosinophils are seen in the CSF. Tumors, meanwhile, are generally associated with an abnormally low number of white blood cells along with a small number of eiosinophils in the CSF.
"
"
"
"Due to the severity of the disease, most dogs with eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis will need to be hospitalized. In cases where no underlying cause can be identified (idiopathic), your veterinarian may prescribe steroids for a few weeks to control inflammation. Otherwise, dogs are kept on certain diet and movement restrictions until a cause, and more specific treatment regimen, can be found.
"
"Overall prognosis heavily depends on the underlying cause of the disease. However, prognosis is good if aggressive treatment is conducted quickly -- most dogs will improve within first 72 hours and recover after six to eight weeks.
"
"During hospitalization, your dog is often examined every six hours. Post-treatment, the veterinarian may request that you bring the dog for regular follow-up evaluations.

"Hepatic encephalopathy is a metabolic disorder that affects the central nervous system. It develops secondary to liver disease (known as hepatopathy). Encephalopathy is the medical term for any disorder of the brain, and hepatic refers to the liver. Hepatic encephalopathy is caused by an accumulation of ammonia in the system due to the liver's inability to rid the body of the substance.
"
"The liver is the largest gland in the body, performing a number of essential functions, including the production of bile (a fluid substance involved in the digestion of fats), production of albumin (a protein in the plasma of the blood), and detoxification of drugs and other chemicals (such as ammonia) in the body.
"
"A portosystemic shunt or portosystemic vascular anomaly is a condition in which blood vessels allow blood to flow abnormally between the portal vein (the vein that normally carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver) and into the body's blood circulation without first being filtered through the liver. This condition can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired (a condition that develops sometime later in life).
"
"Congenital portosystemic shunt or portosystemic vascular anomaly is genetically inherited in some breeds and will generally present at a young age. With acquired forms of this disease, symptoms can occur at any age.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, onset of symptoms, and any background information you have on your dog’s parentage. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, with standard tests including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis so as to rule out other causes of disease. Your veterinarian will use the bloodwork to confirm or rule out impaired kidney function.
"
"X-ray and ultrasound imaging will allow your veterinarian to visually examine the liver. Its appearance will change in certain diseased states. If this appears to be the case your veterinarian may take a sample from the liver by aspiration or biopsy in order to reach a conclusive diagnosis.
"
"
"
"Most patients showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy should be hospitalized. Medications may be prescribed by your veterinarian to help improve dietary protein tolerance, and your dog’s diet should be switched to a diet that is designed for liver or kidney disease. Your dog will need to be placed in a protective environment so that activity is restricted. You may want to consider cage rest during the recovery and therapy process. Oxygen therapy and fluid therapy with electrolyte and vitamin supplementation will need to be given to stabilize your dog’s health, and you will also need to take care to keep your dog warm while it is recovering.
"
"To assure your dog is receiving enough calories, a feeding tube may need to be inserted. Should this be necessary, your veterinarian will go over this process with you for home care.
"
"If the source of the liver disease is a congenital shunt, surgical correction may resolve the condition. If the portosystemic shunt was acquired, abnormal blood vessels should not be tied off.
"
"Zinc supplementation can be given as needed. Other treatments that may be prescribed are antibiotics, enemas, diuretics and seizure-control medications.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your dog according to the underlying diseased state. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your dog’s symptoms return or worsen, if your dog loses weight, or if your dog begins to appear unwell.

"The term “encephalitis” refers to an inflammation of the brain. However, it also may be accompanied by the inflammation of spinal cord (myelitis), and/or the inflammation of the meninges (meningitis), membranes which cover the brain and spinal cord.
"
"German short-haired pointers, Maltese, and Yorkshire terriers are all found to be predisposed to encephalitis.
"
"Although symptoms may vary depending on the portion of brain affected, they typically appear suddenly and are rapidly progressive. Such symptoms include:
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated the unusual behaviors or complications. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which will depend on the underlying cause of the encephalitis.
"
"If your dog has an infection, the complete blood count may show an increased number of white blood cells. Viral infections, meanwhile, may decrease the number of lymphocytes, a type of white cells (also known as lymphopenia). And abnormal reduction in platelets (small cells used in blood clotting) is a good indicator of thrombocytopenia.
"
"To confirm lung involvement and related complications, your veterinarian may employ chest X-rays, while MRIs and CT-scans are used to evaluate the brain involvement in detail. Your veterinarian may also collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is then sent to a laboratory for cultures. This is necessary for definitive diagnosis and to determine the severity of the problem. If culture assays are unsuccessful, a brain tissue sample may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but this is an expensive procedure.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will focus on reducing the severity of the symptoms, such as brain edema and seizures, and halt the progression of the disease. Severe forms of encephalitis require immediate hospitalization and intensive care. For instance, those suspected of having bacterial infections will be given broad spectrum antibiotics, which can reach the brain and spinal cord.
"
"With proper treatment and care, symptoms gradually improve within two to eight weeks; however, the overall prognosis depends on the underlying cause of the condition. For example, in some dogs, symptoms may reappear once treatment is discontinued. In such instances, a second round of treatment (or long-term treatment) may be required to save the dog's life.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up exams to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and the dog's state of health. He or she may even recommend a new diet for the dog, especially if it is frequently vomiting or severely depressed.

"Brain inflammation, also known as encephalitis, may be due to a variety of factors. For instance, parasites can migrate into the dog's central nervous system (CNS), gain entry via blood or through adjacent tissues, including the middle ear, natural opening in the skull, nasal cavities and cribriform plate (part of the skull), or open fontanelles, also called “soft spots.”
"
"These parasites may normally affect another organ system of the same host (e.g., Dirofilaria immitis, Taenia, Ancylostoma caninum, Angiostrongylus, or Toxocara canis), or a different host species (e.g., raccoon roundworm, Baylisascaris procyonis; skunk roundworm, B. columnaris; Coenurus spp., or Cysticercus cellulosae). Dirofilaria immitis is most often seen in adult dogs, while the other parasites generally infect younger pups that are exposed to the outdoors.
"
"Symptoms associated with this type of encephalitis will vary depending on the portion of CNS affected. Cuterebriasis, for example, occurs mainly between July and October in the U.S. and is characterized by the sudden onset of behavior changes, seizures, and vision issues. Meanwhile, a common rat parasite in Australia, Angiostrongylus cantonensis, may cause lumbosacral syndrome in puppies, which can lead to paralysis or paresis of the hindlimbs, tail, and bladder. In addition, parasite infections are often asymmetrical, affecting one side but not the other.
"
"The most common way a dog acquires this type of encephalitis is by being housed in a cage that has been previously occupied by an infected host; e.g., raccoons, skunks.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically normal unless the parasites have also migrated into other organs.
"
"Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may reveal a focal lesion and/or cerebral tissue death from blockage of cerebral blood vessels, both of which are consistent with parasitic infections. A cerebrospinal fluid tap is another common diagnostic method used to confirm parasitic infection; however, the tap may yield normal results despite encephalitis.
"
"
"
"Medication such as anthelmintics (dewormers) may be used to kill off the parasites, but they may also lead to other complications. Consult your veterinarian for the best course of treatment. Puppies with a mild form of angiostrongylosis may even recover fully with just supportive care and corticosteroid therapy. In other cases, surgical removal of intercranial parasites (e.g., Cuterebra) may be necessary.
"
"Most parasitic infections of the central nervous system are incurable and progress in severity. To prevent your dog from contracting such infections keep it indoors and away from wild animals. Dewormers, anthelmintics, and dirofilaricides can also prevent infection.

"Brachycephalic is a term that refers to dog breeds with shortened snouts and flat faces. The term brachycephalic comes from the Greek words brachy, meaning short, and cephalic, meaning head. 
"
"Brachycephalic airway syndrome refers to a specific combination of abnormalities affecting a dog’s airway and breathing, resulting from selectively breeding for this appearance. Their unique smooshed face is a result of shortened skull, facial, and nasal bones. This structural shortening of the face also results in anatomical changes to their throat and airways, creating brachycephalic airway syndrome. 
"
"Specifically, the condition refers to the combination of three functional abnormalities:
"
"Stenotic nares: Referring to narrow nostrils or small nostril openings. This results in a decreased ability to breathe through the nose and restricted airflow, which leads to increased panting and a higher risk of overheating. 
"
"Elongated soft palate: The soft palate is the part of the roof of the mouth made up of tissue that separates the nasal passage from the oral cavity. Given brachycephalic dogs’ shorter snout, the soft palate is often too long for the length of their mouth. The excess flaps into the throat, causing snoring sounds and blocking airflow into the windpipe and lungs. 
"
"Everted laryngeal saccules: In normal anatomy, there are two small pockets (saccules) in the back of the throat. In brachycephalic dogs, there is an increased effort to breathe due to the stenotic nares and elongated soft palate. This increased effort to breathe can cause the saccules to turn inside out and further block the airway. 
"
"Additional airway-related conditions to brachycephalic airway syndrome include:
"
"Hypoplastic trachea: This means the trachea, or windpipe, is congenitally smaller in diameter than normal. This can make it harder for dogs to breathe in enough air with each breath (like breathing through a straw). 
"
"Laryngeal collapse: The larynx, or voice box, can become damaged by chronic stress to the cartilage from working too hard to breathe. Laryngeal collapse leads to more blockage of the airway, and potentially trouble breathing.

"Clinical signs are typically related to upper airway blockage due to the congenital anatomical conditions causing brachycephalic airway syndrome. Symptoms may range from mild to severe and include:
"
"Noisy breathing
"
"Snoring
"
"Gagging or retching
"
"Coughing
"
"Trouble breathing or increased effort to breathe
"
"Increased panting 
"
"Exercise intolerance (tire easily with exercise)
"
"Distended abdomen or vomiting from swallowing too much air while working to breathe
"
"Overheating
"
"Pale or blue gums
"
"Collapse
"
"Brachycephalic airway syndrome is a genetic condition resulting from intentionally breeding dogs for a cosmetic appearance of short snouts with flat faces. Their anatomically shortened heads lead to structural changes to their throats and airways, which can cause trouble breathing and make these dogs prone to overheating.   
"
"Diagnosis will be largely based on the dog’s breed, clinical signs, and physical examination findings, such as stenotic nares (narrowed nostrils). A classic breathing noise characterized as a low-pitched, snoring-type sound called stertor may be noted in dogs with brachycephalic airway syndrome. 
"
"Your veterinarian may want to perform a sedated oral examination to evaluate for elongated soft palate and everted laryngeal saccules. An x-ray of the neck and chest may also visualize the trachea (windpipe) and assess the heart and lungs. A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation.  
"
"Medical management may be an option if clinical signs are mild or infrequent. Excessive weight worsens the symptoms, so medical management for brachycephalic airway syndrome includes weight loss if your dog is overweight or obese. Heat and humidity can also worsen clinical signs, so care should be taken to limit time outside during hot summer days. Excessive exercise can increase stress of breathing and may exacerbate brachycephalic airway syndrome.
"
"If your dog is having trouble breathing while at the vet, they may utilize mild sedatives to help your dog calm down and breathe easier. Additional therapy may be initiated if appropriate, including steroids, oxygen, and cooling measures, all designed to alleviate acute respiratory distress. Medication may also be administered to address any gastrointestinal signs, such as vomiting. 
"
"Surgery may be considered if the structural abnormalities cause distress to your dog, become worse over time, or result in life-threatening trouble breathing from upper airway blockage. Life-threatening would be defined as more than one episode where your pet has had trouble breathing and needed medical assistance.  Multiple procedures are usually required to alleviate the signs of brachycephalic airway syndrome, and include:
"
"Stenotic nares resection: Surgically widening the nostrils.
"
"Soft palate resection (staphylectomy): Surgical trimming of the soft palate to shorten the tissue.
"
"Laryngeal saccule removal: Removing the everted saccules.
"
"All three procedures can be performed at the same time, and this is typically most recommended. Most dogs with brachycephalic airway syndrome are diagnosed by 4 years old, but surgical correction can be performed as early as 4 months of age. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention may help reduce complications of chronic upper airway disease, such as developing laryngeal collapse. If you have a brachycephalic breed, discuss brachycephalic airway syndrome with your veterinarian, and if your dog is a possible candidate for surgery.  
"
"The cost of surgery for brachycephalic airway syndrome can vary depending on many factors, including geographic location, how sick the dog is, and how extensive the procedure needs to be. However, if all three procedures are performed, pet parents can likely expect to paya total between $3,000 and $5,000. 
"
"Pet insurance may be a good idea to help offset anticipated costs and illnesses related to getting a new pup. However, when it comes to inherited and breed-related conditions (like brachycephalic airway syndrome), not all policies offer coverage if conditions are considered pre-existing. Make sure that any pet insurance policy you consider covers brachycephalic dogs and brachycephalic airway syndrome.
"
"Dogs undergoing brachycephalic airway surgery are monitored carefully after surgery, as inflammation and bleeding are possible. Typically, they will remain hospitalized in a 24-hour ICU for 1-2 days of observation. 
"
"The prognosis is good for young dogs, and most pet parents see a significant improvement in their breathing and ability to exercise. However, prognosis may be more guarded in older dogs with a chronic history of trouble breathing, especially if they have started to develop laryngeal collapse. In cases of advanced laryngeal collapse, a tube may need to be inserted in the neck (permanent tracheostomy) to provide improvement in breathing.
"
"For long-term management, it’s crucial to keep brachycephalic dogs lean and at an appropriate weight.  Working with your vet on a weight goal and, if needed, a weight loss plan may be very beneficial. A harness collar is recommended to take pressure off the neck as seen with a traditional neck collar. 
"
"Extreme care should always be taken to ensure that brachycephalic dogs do not overheat. Minimal activity or time outside during hot and humid weather is recommended, and always have plenty of fresh water and access to shade.

"Bowel incontinence in dogs is when a dog loses control of their bowels, resulting in the inability to retain fecal matter. In some cases, the pet is aware that they need to defecate but cannot control the act of defecating. This typically happens with diseases of the colon, rectum, or anus.
"
"In other cases, the dog may not be aware of the need to defecate at all. This is more common with incontinence caused by a neurological disease or a spinal injury.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"If a dog is aware of the need to defecate but unable to control their defecation, signs can include:
"
"Straining to defecate
"
"Blood in stool
"
"Small or frequent bowel movements
"
"Abnormally foul odor to feces
"
"Excessive licking of the perianal region
"
"Scooting
"
"Dogs with neurological causes for their bowel incontinence may appear to defecate at random or while at rest, often without awareness. This form of bowel incontinence is often accompanied by other neurological signs such as:
"
"Changes in gait, such as dragging the hind paws, wobbling, or unsteadiness
"
"Urinary incontinence
"
"Pain when pressure is applied along the spine, which may result in flinching and/or vocalizing
"
"Conditions of the colon, rectum, or anus that could cause bowel incontinence include:
"
"Perianal surgery, such as removal of the anal sacs
"
"Cancer of the anal sac
"
"Perianal fistulas (draining tracts around the anus)
"
"Perineal hernias
"
"Inflammatory or infectious colorectal disease
"
"Dietary indiscretion or intolerance, leading to severe diarrhea
"
"Neurologic conditions that cause bowel incontinence could include:
"
"Lumbosacral stenosis (narrowing of spinal canal near where spinal column meets pelvis)
"
"Infection in the spinal cord or between vertebral discs
"
"Tumors in the spinal cord
"
"Intervertebral disc disease
"
"Spinal trauma
"
"Fibrocartilaginous embolism (spinal stroke)
"
"Congenital abnormalities like spina bifida
"
"Dysautonomia (a malfunctioning of the autonomic nervous system)
"
"Some of these conditions are more common in certain breeds. For example, large- and giant-breed dogs are more likely to experience fibrocartilaginous embolism; Bulldogs are more likely to have congenital spinal malformations; and Dachshunds are predisposed to intervertebral disc disease.
"
"Age alone does not cause bowel incontinence. Some older dogs with cognitive dysfunction may seem to have incontinence. However, this is considered a conscious defecation in an abnormal location.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a physical exam, including a rectal exam, to determine if the fecal incontinence is due to neurologic issues or due to disease of the colon, rectum, or anus.
"
"If the veterinarian suspects that there is disease, additional testing is likely to start with imaging of the abdomen (X-rays and/or ultrasound) and a fecal exam to look for parasites.
"
"If no obvious cause is noted and your pet doesn’t improve with supportive care, your veterinarian may recommend dietary trials to determine if your pet’s food is contributing to their clinical signs.
"
"Your pet may need either surgery or a colonoscopy to take samples of their intestinal walls for a more definitive diagnosis. If a neurologic cause is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extraction and analysis of cerebral spinal fluid are effective procedures that require anesthesia.
"
"In some cases, your veterinarian may also want to rule out specific infectious diseases that can cause neurologic signs including bowel incontinence, such as distemper.
"
"Some causes of bowel incontinence in dogs are curable, while others must be managed long-term.
"
"Surgical management is an option for some conditions, such as intravertebral disc disease. However, other causes of incontinence, such as a tumor within the spinal canal, are unlikely to respond to treatment. In these cases, the condition must be managed.  
"
"If the pet is having bowel incontinence due to an infection like parvovirus, getting over the infection should resolve the issue. When specific infectious causes are found, your veterinarian may recommend medications like antibiotics or antifungals to treat the cause. If inflammation is playing a role, anti-inflammatory medications like NSAIDs (carprofen) or steroids (prednisone) may be prescribed.
"
"In scenarios in which a dietary intolerance is suspected, your veterinarian may recommend trying a novel protein diet or hydrolyzed protein diet. Most dietary intolerances occur due to the proteins in the diet. Novel protein diets include proteins that your pet is unlikely to have consumed before. Hydrolyzed protein diets break the proteins down into smaller, more tolerable nutrients for your pet.
"
"You are unlikely to completely resolve your pet’s bowel incontinence naturally. However, you may choose a highly digestible, low-fiber diet to reduce the volume of stool. If incontinence worsens with this change, speak with your veterinarian about adding an insoluble fiber supplement to improve stool consistency.
"
"A very important part of managing bowel incontinence in dogs is keeping their perineal area clean and dry. Accumulation of moisture in the area can lead to infection of the skin (dermatitis) or urinary tract infections, especially in females. To clean your pet’s perineal area, you can use gentle, scentless wipes that are made for dogs. If your pet is prone to infections in the area, your veterinarian may recommend specific medicated wipes.
"
"We typically do not recommend keeping a diaper on your dog, as this increases the risk of dermatitis or urinary tract infection. Lining their usual resting areas with puppy pads can make clean-up time easier.
"
"For dogs that feel the urge to defecate but have difficulty controlling defecation, more frequent bathroom breaks may be beneficial. Eating food also stimulates colonic movement, so taking your pet outside immediately after meals can help reduce accidents.
"
"Some causes of bowel incontinence, such as severe diarrhea or mild intervertebral disc disease, can be cured or significantly improved. Other conditions, like dysautonomia, do not have a cure at this time.
"
"You may notice small amounts of stool in seemingly random areas of your home or in your pet’s sleeping areas. Alternatively, you may see stool coming out of your pet’s backside seemingly without them knowing.
"
"Older dogs do not inherently lose control of their bowels. Dogs with canine cognitive dysfunction consciously defecate in abnormal areas due to changes to their mental status, not due to loss of bowel control. Canine cognitive dysfunction has been compared to dementia in humans. Older dogs are also more likely to develop certain conditions, such as tumors of the spinal cord, which may also cause bowel incontinence.

"Normally, a dog’s eyes do not bulge outside of the eyelid, and the eyelids should be able to close completely over the eyes.  
"
"Bulging eyes can be caused by a change in the position and/or the size of the eye. As the eyes start to bulge, this can cause swelling and pressure changes. Even slight changes in pressure can cause pain, corneal damage, impaired vision, and a risk of blindness very quickly.
"
"Bulging eyes are considered a medical emergency. If you notice your dog’s eyes have changed position or are swelling or bulging, contact your veterinarian or urgent care vet immediately.
"
"Here are the three main reasons that eyes can bulge in dogs:
"
"Proptosis—when the eye is suddenly loosened out of the eye socket
"
"Exophthalmos—when the eye bulges forward but is still in the eye socket
"
"Buphthalmos—when the eye itself is enlarged
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Not every symptom will be present in every case of bulging eyes in dogs, but signs may include one or more of the following depending on the underlying reason.
"
"Signs of proptosis in dogs may include:
"
"Whining, pawing at the eye, restlessness, trying to bite
"
"Severely red eye
"
"Dry cornea
"
"Ruptured eye muscles (eye hanging to the side)
"
"Ruptured optic nerve (eye dangling by frayed whitish fiber)
"
"Blood inside the eye
"
"Ruptured eye (has a hole, looks deflated, is leaking)
"
"Signs of exophthalmos in dogs may include:
"
"Unable to completely close eyelid
"
"Corneal ulcer
"
"Pain opening the mouth
"
"Swelling of the tissues around the eye
"
"Swelling and redness of the conjunctiva (membrane on inner eyelid and whites of eye)
"
"Signs of buphthalmos in dogs may include:
"
"Red eye
"
"Cloudy cornea, possibly small blood vessels on the cornea
"
"Dilated pupil
"
"Luxated lens (lens out of place)
"
"Blindness
"
"Each of the ways that a dog could suffer from bulging eyes has its own underlying causes.
"
"Head trauma is the most common cause, such as a dog fight or being hit by a car.
"
"Excessive pressure around the neck from choke collars or scruffing (grabbing a dog by the scruff of the neck).
"
"Short-nosed (brachycephalic) dogs are at higher risk
"
"Orbital cellulitis: Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the tissues behind the eye due to bacterial or fungal infection. It can be the result of trauma to the eye socket, tooth root abscess, or a foreign body (e.g. piece of stick or foxtail) stuck behind the eye.
"
"Retrobulbar abscess: A retrobulbar abscess is a pocket of pus behind the eye due to an infection from one of the causes listed above.
"
"Hemorrhage: This is bleeding behind the eye, which can be due to trauma to the eye, rat/mouse poison, low platelets, or a coagulation disorder.
"
"Tumor: While tumors in the tissue behind the eye are uncommon, a nose tumor or brain tumor may cause the eye to bulge forward.
"
"Masticatory myositis: This is an autoimmune swelling of the muscles of the head and the muscles behind the eyes. The typical signs are pain opening the jaw, with difficulty eating and drinking. Swelling of the muscles behind the eyes causes them to bulge forward and may lead to blindness. It is common in Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, and Weimaraners.
"
"Extraocular myositis: This is an autoimmune swelling of the muscles that attach the eyes to the socket. It is a rare disorder, but it is more likely to occur in Golden Retrievers than in other breeds.
"
"Craniomandibular osteopathy: In this disease, puppies develop excess bone on their skull starting at about 5–8 months of age. They are in a lot of pain and can have difficulty eating and drinking. Puppies can develop bulging eyes and glaucoma because of added bone in their eye sockets.
"
"Temporomandibular joint (jaw) dislocation: If the jaw joint becomes dislocated, the eyes will bulge forward. This is more common in Basset Hounds, which can have dysplasia of the jaw joint.
"
"Zygomatics salivary gland mucocele: Severe swelling or blockage of the salivary gland below the eye can cause the eye to bulge forward.
"
"Breed-related: Brachycephalic dogs with short noses such as the Pug or French Bulldog tend to have eyes that bulge forward normally. This causes no discomfort on a day-to-day basis. However, these dogs are more prone to corneal ulcers and proptosis with even a slight head injury.
"
"Glaucoma: In glaucoma, fluid cannot drain normally from the eye, enlarging it. Glaucoma can be inherited in the Miniature Poodle, Boston Terrier, Shar-Pei, Chow Chow, American Cocker Spaniel, Basset Hound, Great Dane, and Welsh Springer Spaniel.
"
"Tumor inside the eye: Tumors that occur inside the eye include melanoma, ciliary body tumors, and metastatic tumors that have spread to the eye from elsewhere in the body.
"
"Hemorrhage, bacterial, or fungal infection inside the eye: The causes for each are the same as above but occur inside the eye, causing the eye itself to become enlarged.
"
"To diagnose bulging eyes, the veterinarian will do a complete history and physical examination plus an eye examination. All eye examinations will include an intraocular pressure check for glaucoma and a fluorescein test to check for corneal ulcers.
"
"Other possible tests may be a Schirmer tear test to measure tear production, blood tests, X-rays, eye ultrasound, fine-needle aspirate, or biopsy to figure out the cause.
"
"Treatment will depend on the underlying reason causing the eye bulging and how much damage has occurred to the eye.
"
"If there has been minimal trauma, the veterinarian may recommend surgery to reposition the eye with sutures to hold it back in place. If the eye has sustained serious damage and long-term pain and blindness are expected, the veterinarian may recommend removal of the eye.
"
"Orbital Cellulitis and Retrobulbar Abscess
"
"Infection without a foreign object or abscess may be treated with antibiotics or antifungal medication. Sometimes surgery is needed in cases of infection of the nearby eye socket to remove infected bone.
"
"If a dental tooth root abscess was the primary cause, dental surgery is needed to remove the affected tooth along with antibiotic therapy.
"
"Hemorrhage
"
"Treatment for bleeding depends on the primary cause, such as vitamin K1 for rat/mouse poison, treatment for low platelets, or the primary cause of a coagulation disorder.
"
"Tumor Behind the Eye
"
"Treatment options depend on the diagnosis and typically also on advanced imaging such as a CT scan or MRI.
"
"Masticatory Myositis and Extraocular Myositis
"
"These autoimmune disorders typically respond well to prednisone (a steroid), which should be tapered very slowly under the direction of your veterinarian.
"
"Craniomandibular Osteopathy
"
"There is no cure for this disorder. The excess bone will start to completely or partially break down when the puppies are about a year old. Treatment is focused on giving puppies the nutritional support and pain relief they need, as well as glaucoma medications if their eyes are affected.
"
"Temporomandibular Joint (Jaw) Dislocation
"
"Treatment for jaw dislocation is surgery to repair any fractures, dysplasia of the jaw, or dental issues. Dogs may need a feeding tube or liquid diet during the recovery period.
"
"Zygomatic Salivary Gland Mucocele
"
"Treatment for a salivary gland mucocele is surgery to remove the salivary gland. This is a small gland, and its removal does not affect long-term saliva production.
"
"Glaucoma
"
"Eye enlargement due to glaucoma is an emergency and is treated with eye drops and potentially with intravenous (IV) mannitol or oral medications. Your veterinarian may recommend referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist or emergency clinic for your pet’s treatment.
"
"Tumor Inside the Eye
"
"Tumors within the eye itself are rare but may need referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist and/or veterinary oncologist for treatment. Treatment options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, cryotherapy, or possibly removing the eye.
"
"Hemorrhage, Bacterial, or Fungal Infection Inside the Eye
"
"Treatment is the same as above, except that management of disorders within the eye rather than outside it is much more delicate. Your veterinarian may recommend referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist.
"
"Since the causes of bulging eyes vary, recovery depends on both the disease and the treatment the dog receives. In general, an issue that can be treated with surgery will resolve more quickly than other diseases or infections. Some bacterial or tick-borne infections may require long courses of antibiotics.
"
"Glaucoma is typically a chronic, lifelong disease unless the dog develops it secondary to another disorder that can be corrected, such as an infection or lens luxation.
"
"Prevention is key when it comes to limiting bulging eyes in dogs. Outside of underlying causes that can trigger the issue, there are ways to prevent trauma or injury to your pup’s eyes:
"
"Use harnesses instead of collars on short-nosed (brachycephalic) dogs.
"
"Don’t let your dog play or run in areas where there are long, dry grasses with potential foxtails.
"
"Don’t breed dogs that have had known inherited medical issues.
"
"Get your dog to the vet as soon as you see any squinting, redness, or discharge from your dog’s eye(s). Your vet would rather see a dog before the eye is bulging, when it is easier and less expensive to treat.
"
"Certain breeds appear “doe-eyed” or to have larger eyes than others due to their shorter noses and shallower eye sockets. This is normal for these breeds. These dogs tend to have medical issues associated with the shallow eye sockets, including dry eyes, corneal scratches and ulcers, and proptosis with minimal head trauma.
"
"Except in the case of a short-nosed/brachycephalic dog that appears comfortable with clear eyes, bulging eyes are an emergency. The eyes are at risk of drying out, developing ulcers, and losing their blood or nerve supply. Pain or blindness can result.

"Botulism is a rare but potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. Dogs become affected by eating decomposing animal carcasses or spoiled vegetation where the bacterium grows. Once eaten and absorbed from the stomach and intestines, the toxin attacks the body’s nerves, resulting in weakness (paresis), and eventually the inability to move (paralysis). This can progress quickly to breathing difficulties or even eventual death, if left untreated.  
"
"Botulism is considered a medical emergency and can be deadly without prompt treatment. If you believe your pet is experiencing any of the signs of botulism, contact your local veterinarian immediately.
"
"Clinical signs of botulism may develop within a few hours but can be delayed up to six days. Signs can vary based on the amount of toxin consumed, but the earlier the signs appear, the more serious the disease. Clinical signs of botulism include:
"
"Hypertrophic osteopathy refers to an abnormal enlargement of bone due to new bone formation. It commonly occurs in humans and dogs and has been reported in dogs, horse, cow, sheep, and various other more exotic species.
"
"In dogs the disease is characterized by swelling, primarily affecting all four limbs. Subtle in onset, it is often mistaken for early arthritis. Neoplasia is a common cause of this disease, and therefore, more common in older dogs as neoplasia is more common in older dogs.
"
"The exact cause of new bone formation is still unknown, but this condition has been seen in association with various diseases, including:
"
"Your veterinarian will take a detailed history, asking you about the duration and frequency of symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis will be conducted. The results are usually normal but may vary depending on the underlying disease, if present. X-rays of the bone may reveal new bone formation and help your veterinarian in localizing the disease. He or she may also decide to take bone sample for further evaluation, including investigating for the presence of tumors.
"
"
"
"Diagnosis of the underlying cause and treating it are major goals for the resolution of the problem. However, as exact etiology is still unknown, finding the underlying cause and treating it is not always possible. Your veterinarian will prescribe painkillers to alleviate pain and drugs to reduce swelling at affected sites. In some cases, surgery may be required to remove the tumor mass.
"
"It is important to follow the guidelines and administer medication at the right dosage and time to maintain quality of life. But even after treatment of the primary cause, clinical symptoms may continue for one to two weeks. Bone(s), meanwhile, may take months to get back to its original shape, even with the correction of the underlying disorder and are not known to be fully reversible. Your dog may feel sore and may need therapy for pain management at home.
"
"If a metastic tumor is the underlying cause of the hypertrophic osteopathy, prognosis is very poor.

"Osteochondrodysplasia (OCD) is a growth and developmental abnormality of the bone and cartilage, which results in lack of normal bone growth and bone deformities. Where osteo refers to the bone, chondro refers to the cartilage, and dysplasia is a general term that is applied to abnormal growth. Dog breeds that tend to be predisposed to this disorder are great Pyrenees, Alaskan malamutes, Samoyeds, Scottish deerhounds, Labrador retrievers, basset hounds, and Norwegian elkhounds.
"
"Achondroplasia is a form of osteochondrodysplasia in which the bones do not grow to the normal size, based on what is expected of the breed. This is caused by a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene. The result is abnormally short limbs, a condition called dwarfism. In some breeds this trait is selectively encouraged, such as with the dachshund, Skye terrier, and Welsh corgi. Other breeds that are reported to be affected are bulldogs, German shepherds, basset hounds, Boston terriers, pugs, Pekingese, Japanese spaniels, shih-tzus, beagles, English pointers, cocker Spaniels, and Scottish terriers.
"
"These disorders are genetically acquired.
"
"Osteochondrodysplasia is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, meaning that it can be passed along by either gender and only one parent need carry the gene for an offspring to be potentially affected.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a detailed medical history, including when you first noticed symptoms of growth abnormality, and any information you have about your dog's genetic background. Routine laboratory testing will include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile and urinalysis to rule out other causes for the disorder. X-rays of the affected limbs will be taken, which will show abnormalities related to bone growth and structure. X-rays of the spine will also show such abnormalities in patients with spinal deviation. To confirm a diagnosis, your veterinarian will take a sample of tissue from the small bones of the body and send it to a veterinary pathologist for further diagnostic testing.
"
"
"
"After establishing the diagnosis, your veterinarian may decide to correct the problem with surgery. However, results of such corrective surgery are usually not rewarding. Pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications are recommended for many affected patients as bone deformities can cause significant pain for these patients. Your dog's feelings of comfort and its projected life-span depend on the severity of the problem. If it is relatively minor, it is entirely possible for your dog to go on to live a relatively comfortable and healthy life.
"
"The prognosis of this disease depends on the extent of problem. There is no definitive treatment option available for treating this disorder, and the outcome varies according to the severity of the disorder and which bones are affected. For some dogs, the bone dysplasia can be incapacitating, while for others, learning to compensate for the smaller limb size and reduction in mobility is successfully achieved.
"
"Dogs that are affected with osteochondrodysplasia may be more prone to arthritic developments. This is something to be aware of as your dog ages. Another precaution to keep in mind is the risk of obesity that is a common side effect of this disorder. Make sure that you stay to a healthy diet and be observant of your dog's weight and physical health. If your veterinarian does recommend pain medications, be sure to use them with caution and with full instruction from your veterinarian. One of the most preventable accidents with pets is an overdose of medication.
"
"As these disorders are genetically acquired, breeding is not recommended.

"Progressive, symmetrical, ascending weakness that begins in the rear limbs. This is a classic hallmark sign of botulism in dogs.

"Despite being paralyzed, affected dogs are mentally normal, and can still sense their environment and feel pain.
"
"If left untreated, most pets die of botulism due to respiratory distress as the muscles used for breathing, such as the diaphragm, becomes paralyzed and the dog is unable to breathe. However, the paralysis can affect other organs, such as the heart—which can also be fatal. If your pet is experiencing any of the above clinical signs of botulism, contact a veterinarian immediately.  
"
"Botulism is caused by the botulinum toxin, which is produced by the bacteria C. botulinum. There are seven subtypes of C. botulinum (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G). All of them have the same effect on the nervous system. Subtypes A, B, E, and F are associated with botulism in humans while most cases in dogs are caused by subtype C.
"
"Once a dog consumes the toxin, it is absorbed in the stomach and intestines and carried in the bloodstream to the nerves. Nerves in the body are used to signal muscles to contract. Botulinum toxin blocks this process so that the muscles are unable to contract, creating muscle weakness and paralysis.
"
"The diaphragm muscle is the muscle separating the abdomen and thorax. Its contraction plays a major role in breathing. Luckily, it is more resistant than other muscles in the body to the botulinum toxin, but once affected, a dog cannot breathe and, without therapy, will die.
"
"Botulism in dogs can be very hard to diagnose because it is very rare, and the paralysis can mimic other diseases such as tick paralysis, intervertebral disc disease, degenerative myelopathy, toxins, myasthenia gravis, nerve and muscle disease. It is very important to share any history of possible exposure to carcasses, dead animals, rotting vegetation, or raw meat with your veterinarian.
"
"Your veterinarian will start with a thorough physical examination to assess weakness, spinal reflexes, pain, and fever. They will also perform a complete orthopedic and neurologic examination.
"
"Current tests to diagnose botulism involve highly specialized laboratory testing to detect the botulinum toxin in blood, feces, vomit, or in the ingested material. However, these tests are neither timely nor accurate enough to typically establish a diagnosis in time to be useful. Therefore, the diagnosis is typically made based on the history, clinical signs, while ruling out other illnesses with similar signs.
"
"A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation, and to help rule out other causes of paralysis. An X-ray may be taken to assess for signs of pneumonia or changes in the esophagus (megaesophagus) commonly seen with botulism.
"
"While there is an antitoxin for botulism, it is not readily available in veterinary hospitals and must be given before the toxin reaches the nerve endings and causes clinical signs. Once a pet develops signs of paralysis, the antitoxin is not effective.
"
"Treatment of botulism in dogs is mainly supportive care. This supportive care can be time-consuming and expensive as it will require hospitalization, likely in an intensive care unit (ICU). Mildly affected dogs may be able to continue to eat and drink on their own with assistance, while more severely affected dogs will likely need IV fluids (to keep them hydrated) and feeding tubes.

"Care must be taken to provide sufficient bedding/padding and rotation of positioning to prevent an unmoving patient from developing bed sores. Urinary care must also be tended to either by keeping the patient clean and dry or, if the dog loses the ability to urinate, providing manual bladder expression or urinary catheter care. Antibiotics and supportive medications, including medications for eye lubrication, pain, nausea, or diarrhea may also be given.
"
"If the paralysis continues to progress and affects the diaphragm, dogs may lose the ability to breathe on their own and require manual ventilation with a ventilator.
"
"The botulinum toxin does not damage the nerves, but rather blocks the signals to the muscles to contract. Since there is no nerve damage, supportive care often results in complete recovery. However, clinical signs of botulism often last for two-to-three weeks, and pets may need intense supportive care the entire time.
"
"Prevention is key to protect dogs from botulism. Never let your dog ingest raw meat, dead animals, or spoiled vegetation. It is best to keep a close eye on them when outside or in wooded areas. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine against botulism for dogs.
"
" 
"
"The hallmark sign of botulism in dogs is a progressive, symmetrical, ascending weakness, which means the pet becomes weak in the rear legs and that weakness moves up the body, affecting the front legs, head, and neck. If untreated, the weakness will likely progress to paralysis of all four legs.
"
"If untreated, botulism can result in paralysis of not only the limbs but also the muscles responsible for breathing. This can lead to asphyxiation and death. However, with aggressive treatment, pets can survive botulism and go on to make a complete recovery.
"
"The main way dogs get botulism is by eating decaying animal carcasses or rotting vegetation that contain the bacterium C. botulinum. This bacterium produces the deadly botulinum toxin.
"
"In most cases, clinical signs of botulism appear within the first few hours of eating the toxin, but signs can be delayed up to six days.

"Cuterebra is a type of botfly whose larvae embed themselves as parasites in a dog’s skin, eyes, upper respiratory tract, or central nervous system (brain/spinal cord). People also call them “warbles” or “wolf worms” when they are in the larval stage.
"
"Botflies can be found in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In the northern U.S., the disease is seasonal, with most cases occurring in late summer and early fall when the adult flies are active. The typical hosts for botflies are rabbits and rodents, but dogs can get warbles if they come across the larvae in the grass, especially if they are hunting these animals or are near their burrows.
"
"Symptoms of warbles, or botflies in dogs, vary depending upon where the Cuterebra infestation occurs on your dog.
"
"Swelling around the area of skin where the larva is (usually around the face or neck)
"
"Lethargy
"
"Lack of appetite
"
"Vomiting
"
"In very rare cases, a severe systemic inflammatory condition called disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) develops as a result of warbles in dogs. This causes excessive bleeding or clots that cut off blood supply to vital organs.

"
"Cuterebra is caused by an infestation of larvae from the Cuterebra group of botflies. There are 34 species of Cuterebra in North America.
"
"Botflies lay eggs on blades of grass or in nests, where they hatch. Dogs become infected with a botfly larva when they come into contact with a blade of grass that has a maggot on it. The dog's movement against the blade of grass stimulates the maggot to crawl onto the dog or passing host.
"
"The small maggots crawl around until they find an orifice where they can enter (mouth, ear, nose, etc.). Then, they migrate through various internal tissues and, ultimately, make their way into the skin.
"
"They establish themselves within a warble (a small lump in the skin). The mature maggots, which may be an inch long, then drop out of the host and form a pupa in the soil. Eventually, an adult botfly will emerge from the pupa and start the whole cycle again.
"
"Any breed of dog can become infested by Cuterebra. However, one study showed that 80% of affected dogs weighed less than 10 pounds, and 40% of affected dogs were Yorkshire Terriers (likely due to size and popularity of the breed).
"
"Your veterinarian will look for evidence of the fly larvae in cases of skin or respiratory tract infestation. If your dog has respiratory disease characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms or symptoms only affecting one side, such as nasal discharge and facial swelling, your vet will evaluate them for botfly larvae within the throat, mouth, or nasal passages. This is usually performed under general anesthesia.
"
"In cases affecting the nervous system, CT scans, spinal taps, or MRIs are used to identify evidence of botfly larvae infestation in dogs.
"
"Treatment for skin, respiratory tract, and eye infestations of botflies in dogs includes manual removal of the larvae followed by cleaning of the wound. Your dog may also need antibiotics to treat secondary infection.
"
"Ivermectin, an ingredient used in dog heartworm medications, is used to treat cases affecting a dog’s brain and spinal cord. This can stop symptoms from progressing but may not cure existing symptoms. Your veterinarian might use diphenhydramine (Benadryl) in conjunction with ivermectin to prevent an allergic reaction.
"
"After botfly removal, monitor the area for discharge, swelling, or delayed healing. Cases of eye/brain infestation can take weeks to months to completely resolve.
"
"Some dogs with cases of Cuterebra eye infestation do well after removal of the larva and getting anti-inflammatories, but others may develop blindness or glaucoma. Cuterebra skin infestations can result in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or DIC, but this is not common.
"
"Your dog’s symptoms will vary depending upon where the botfly is in their body. Monitor them for the symptoms listed above—especially if they have access to rodent or rabbit burrows.
"
"Dogs with skin and upper-respiratory Cuterebra infestations have a good prognosis after complete removal of the larvae. Cases of nervous-system cuterebriasis have a 30% mortality rate for dogs—usually as a result of euthanasia due to symptom severity.
"
"Botfly larvae live in their host for 3-6 weeks.
"
"Once a botfly is inside a dog’s body, it cannot be transmitted to another animal or to a human.
"
"During the summer months, adults of the Cuterebra group of botflies lay their eggs at the entrance of rodent or rabbit dens, which are their primary hosts. Dogs can become accidentally infested with Cuterebra after sniffing rabbit or rodent dens or coming in direct contact with eggs.
"
"The host’s body temperature stimulates the botfly eggs to hatch, and the larvae attach to the host’s skin. The larvae cannot directly penetrate the skin, but they can enter through a dog’s mouth, nose, open wounds, or any other openings in the skin.
"
"They will migrate through the skin and further develop in the tissue layers beneath the skin. A nodule with an external breathing hole can be seen on your dog’s skin after 3-4 weeks of development.

"Chondrosarcoma (CSA) of the bone is a fast spreading and malignant form of cancer, which, if not diagnosed and treated early, can be life threatening. Chondrosarcoma arises from the cartilage of the body, the connective tissue that is found between the bones and joints, often metastasizing to other parts of the body, including the ribs. This is the most common rib tumor found in dogs, and the second most common primary tumor in dogs, representing 5 to 10 percent of all primary bone tumors.
"
"The majority of CSAs involves flat bones, with about 30 percent occurring in the nasal cavity and about 20 percent involving the ribs. This form of cancer also affects the limbs, with a resulting weakening in the structure of the bone due to the invasive tumor. Fractures of the bone are common.
"
"Large dog breeds are at higher risk, as well as older dogs. Chondrosarcoma most commonly affects dogs around eight years of age, but it has been found in dogs of almost all ages.
"
"Although an exact cause has not been identified, multiple cartilaginous growths or protuberance may lead to this form of cancer.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, including a complete blood count (CBC), a biochemistry profile, and a urinalysis. The results of these tests are usually within normal ranges. Tissue samples from the local lymph nodes will also be taken for analysis of cancer cells and evidence of immune system response.
"
"Radiographic studies of the affected areas may show the extent of the tumor’s invasion. X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, nuclear bone scans, and radiographic scans will usually be helpful in diagnosing the stage and type of the tumor. Bone scans may show involvement of soft tissue and adjacent bones. The most conclusive and direct method for making a diagnosis is normally by taking a biopsy of the growth for microscopic laboratory analysis.
"
"
"
"This is highly aggressive and life-threatening tumor, which requires prompt treatment. Amputation or limb salvage is usually recommended in cases where there is no metastasis (spreading) of the tumor in the affected limb. For nasal tumors, radiation therapy is normally the treatment of choice. Radiotherapy may also help in prolonging the lifespans in those dogs in which tumors are inoperable.
"
"If the tumor involves the ribs, your veterinarian may decide to remove the affected ribs and nearby lung tissues through a wide excision in order to prevent metastasis. Chemotherapy may also be recommended, but the effectiveness of this therapy has not yet been fully evaluated for CSA. Currently, surgery is the only treatment given for this disease.
"
"You may be advised to revisit your veterinarian every three month for follow-up evaluation. During this time, your veterinarian will evaluate your dog to see if any metastasis has occurred. Routine X-rays will be taken of the affected part and other body areas to check for recurrence and spread of the tumor.
"
"After surgery, you should expect your dog to feel sore. You will need to limit your dog’s activity until it heals, setting aside a quite place for it to rest, away from windows, entryways, common areas, other pets, and active children. If it is difficult to control your dog’s movement, you may consider cage rest, placing your dog’s food dishes close by for its comfort. If possible, slow walks close to home will be best, but if your dog is in too much pain to go outdoors to relieve itself, you will need to consider making a temporary space indoors for the interim, carrying your dog outdoors, or using a catheter. Ask your veterinarian for advice regarding which method would be best for your dog.
"
"In case of leg amputation, most dogs will not have any problems learning to compensate for the lost limb and will go on to live a happy and comfortable life.
"
"Pain management is crucial for the effective treatment of chondrosarcoma; your veterinarian will prescribe the appropriate painkillers. Follow instructions for medications strictly. One of the most avoidable causes of death for domestic pets is overmedication.
"
"Nutrition is very important for a swift recovery and you will need to monitor your dog’s food and water intake while it is recovering, making sure that it is hydrated enough and is getting sufficient amounts of food, but taking care not to overfeed your dog. If your dog cannot take food on its own, your veterinarian will instruct you on the proper use of a feeding tube that can be passed down into the stomach for food administration.

"There are a variety of reactions that can occur with the transfusion of any blood product. Most reactions usually occur during or shortly after transfusions. Purebred dogs, especially, that have had previous blood transfusions are at a higher risk for severe reactions to transfusion than other dogs.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Reaction to a blood transfusion may be classified by one of the following conditions: immune system related; acute reaction (an immediate, sudden reaction); or delayed reaction.
"
"Acute symptoms of a reaction to blood transfusion may include fever, vomiting, weakness, incontinence, shock, collapse, and general loss of transfusion effectiveness. Symptoms of a delayed reaction are usually not directly apparent and result only in a loss of the transfusion’s effectiveness.
"
"Many symptoms vary depending on the exact cause. Transfusion of contaminated blood can result in fever, shock, and septicemia -- an invasion of disease producing bacteria into the bloodstream. Circulatory overload resulting from rapid or excessive transfusion can result in vomiting, cough, and heart failure. Hypothermia, which can stem from transfusion of cold refrigerated blood -- usually in smaller dogs or already hypothermic (abnormally low body temperature) patients -- is evident in shivering and impaired platelet function.
"
"There are several circumstances that may be responsible for a blood transfusion reaction, such as transfusion of a mismatched blood type; transfusion of contaminated blood and consequent blood-born disease from an infected donor; circulatory overload caused by too-rapid or too-large amounts of transfusion; or transfusion of damaged red blood cells which have been improperly stored (i.e., due to excessive heating or freezing). In addition to these causes, the dog’s immune system may react to various components in the donor’s blood. Symptoms will usually surface in the course of three to fourteen days.
"
"Diagnosis of reaction to blood transfusion is based largely on symptoms that show after transfusion. Tests include a urine analysis, retesting of blood type to confirm rejection of donor blood, and a bacteria analysis of the transfused blood.
"
"Symptoms of reaction that result in fever or hypotension (low blood pressure ) may also be diagnosed as inflammatory disease, or may be found to have been caused by an infectious disease.
"
"
"
"If your dog exhibits a reaction to a blood transfusion, your veterinarian will immediately discontinue the transfusion and administer fluids in order to maintain the dog’s blood pressure and circulation. Depending on the severity and cause of the reaction, additional interventions may be necessary. Specific treatment depends on the cause and symptoms, and may also be administered through medication. For example, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be given for septicemia, or for bacterial infection.
"
"The patient’s basic vital signs (breathing and pulse) should be tracked before, during, and after a blood transfusion. In addition, temperature, lung sounds, and plasma color should be checked frequently.
"
"Blood transfusion reactions may be prevented by following standard blood transfusion protocol: thorough cross-checking of blood types to assure a match, condition of donor blood to prevent infection or spread of disease, and appropriate storage of donor blood. Transfusion should begin initially at an amount of one milliliter per minute, and all transfusion activity should be appropriately recorded in the patient’s medical file.

"Polycythemia vera is a blood disorder that involves the thickening of the blood due to an overproduction of red blood cells by the bone marrow. It is primarily seen in older dogs.
"
"The following symptoms gradually appear but run a chronic course:
"
"Although the viscosity of the blood is due to an increased production of red blood cells by the bone marrow, the cause of this overproduction is currently unknown.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Blood testing will typically reveal an increase in red blood cell mass, and in about 50 percent of dogs, an increased number of white blood cells (leukocytosis).
"
"To assess the function of the kidneys and cardiopulmonary systems, your veterinarian will conduct X-rays and abdominal ultrasounds. Echocardiography, meanwhile, is used to evaluate the cardiac functions. He or she will also take a sample of bone marrow and send it to a veterinary pathologist for further examination.
"
"Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) occurs when a blood clot lodges in one of the arteries that feed into the lungs. Slow-flowing blood and blood vessel damage, in addition to blood which clots too easily, can predispose a dog to thrombus (blood clot) formation. Most of the time, pulmonary PTE is caused by another underlying disease process.
"
"Pulmonary thromboemboli (blood clots) can originate in the right atrium of the heart, or in many of the major veins throughout the body. As the dog's body makes oxygenated blood to deliver to the heart and lungs, this clump of blood cells is carried through the bloodstream toward the lungs, where it gets caught in a narrow portion of one of the passages of the arterial network that feeds oxygenated blood to the lungs. In this way, the blood flow through that artery is halted, and oxygenated blood is not able to reach the lung. The severity of the condition is, to a degree, dependent on the size of the blood clot.
"
"PTE can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. In most cases, the bloodwork will be necessary for pinpointing an underlying disease.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues to the clot's origin.
"
"Arterial blood gases will be taken to check for low oxygen in the blood. A coagulation profile will be done to detect a clotting disorder; these tests include the one-stage prothrombin time (OSPT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Heartworm serology will also be performed.
"
"X-ray images of the dog's chest will allow your doctor to visually examine your dog for pulmonary artery abnormalities, enlargement of the heart, lung patterns, or fluid in the lungs. Your veterinarian may choose the more sensitive echocardiogram (an ultrasound image of the heart) to see the motion and size of the heart and its surrounding structures more clearly, because since a thrombus in the right chamber of the heart, or in the main pulmonary artery, will sometimes show up on an echocardiogram.
"
"Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings can indicate cor pulmonale, enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart due to increased blood pressure in the lungs. Serious heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) will be evident on an ECG. 
"
"There is also pulmonary angiography, which uses an injection of a radiocontrasting agent into the dog's lung arteries to improve visibility on the X-ray, and spiral computed tomography (CT), which is three-dimensional X-ray imaging for non-selective angiography.
"
"
"
"Dogs with PTE should be hospitalized, primarily for oxygen therapy. If the dog is not receiving enough oxygen to its heart, lungs, or brain, the veterinarian will recommend rest in a caged environmentl this is generally due to hypoxemia or syncope. However, the underlying cause of the condition will be treated once your veterinarian has settled on a definitive diagnosis.
"
"Unfortunately, this disease is usually fatal. Unless the underlying cause of disease is found and corrected, pets will often suffer a recurrence of PTE.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule weekly checkups with the your dog to monitor its blood clotting times, since anticoagulant medications can cause bleeding disorders on the opposite side of the scale. The new low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant medicines are much safer for use, but they are also more expensive.
"
"
"
"Initially, the veterinarian will draw a fair amount of blood and replace it with intravenous fluids to decrease the blood's viscosity. However, this is only for quick relief. Long-term therapy, for both animals and humans, involve using an antineoplastic drug called hydroxyurea, which suppresses the overproduction of red blood cells in the bone marrow.
"
"During treatment, your veterinarian will need to see the dog for regular follow-up exams, especially when it is taking hydroxurea, as it may sometimes cause bone marrow suppression. In addition, follow the veterinary oncologist's dosage recommendation when using on chemotherapy medications, such as hydroxurea, because these drugs are highly toxic.

"The term pancytopenia does not refer to a disease itself, but rather to the simultaneous development of a number of blood-related deficiencies: non-regenerative anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The root word pan refers to all or whole, and cytopenia refers to a lack of cells circulating in the blood.
"
"Nonregenerative anemia is a condition characterized by a low red-blood cell count and the bone marrow’s lack of response to produce additionally needed red-blood cells; leucopenia refers to a low white-blood cell count; and thrombocytopenia refers to a low platelet and thrombocyte count (the cells that function in blood coagulation). 
"
"Pancytopenia can affect both cats and dogs, and may develop from a number of multiple causes. There is no specific age, or breed of animal known to be more susceptible to the development of pancytopenia.
"
"If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"The symptoms that develop in the dog depend largely on the underlying cause leading to pancytopenia. Some symptoms of leucopenia (low white-blood cell count) include repeated episodes of fever, and frequent or persistent infections. Some symptoms of anemia due to low red-blood cell count include sluggishness and pale gums.
"
"Low platelet count due to thrombocytopenia may lead to tiny pinpoint bruises on the dog's body, referred to as petechial hemorrhate, or bleeding from the moist tissues of the body, known as mucosal bleeding. Other general symptoms may include lethargy, bleeding (i.e., nosebleeds or blood in the urine), and fever. 
"
"There are a variety of causes for pancytopenia. These include infectious diseases, such as hepatitis; the tick-born disease ehrlichiosis, exposure to poisons such as thallium; proliferative diseases such as bone marrow cancer; and immune-mediated diseases such as aplastic anemia, in which the bone marrow loses its ability to produce red-blood cells.
"
"A veterinary exam is necessary to determine the underlying cause of pancytopenia, and to diagnose the condition itself.  
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, including a complete blood count, and a chemical blood profile. Other possible tests include urine analysis, immunologic tests for infections diseases, and a bone marrow examination. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, and onset of symptoms, if any. 
"
"
"
"Treatment depends on the primary condition that led to pancytopenia, as it is essential that the primary disease be diagnosed and treated first. Aggressive antibiotic therapy and blood transfusions may be necessary. Medications for the underlying cause may be necessary, in addition to various medications to stimulate the production of neutrophils (a type of white blood-cell that fights infection), and another medication to stimulate the production of red-blood cells by bone marrow. 
"
"Daily physical examinations should be given after initial treatment, including frequent monitoring of body temperature and a periodic complete blood count (CBC). The frequency of CBC checks depends on how severely low the patient’s blood-cell and platelet counts were and are, as well as the underlying cause of the disease. 
"
"Additional care measures depend upon the underlying cause of disease. Depending on the severity, these may include inpatient care at a hospital, and aggressive therapy. 
"
"There are many causes of pancytopenia, and it is not possible to prevent against all of them. However, some precautions can be taken. Dogs should be kept up to date with vaccinations that may prevent infectious diseases.
"
"For dogs with cancer, there is a danger of developing pancytopenia as a side effect of cancer treatment, and frequent CBC monitoring will need to be done.

"Hemothorax is a condition that may occur suddenly (acute) or over a long period of time (chronic), and it can occur for a variety of reasons. Hemothorax is the medical term used to identify a condition in which blood has collected in the chest cavity, or thorax. There does not appear to be a particular age, gender, or breed of dog that is more predisposed to this condition than another.
"
"Acute onset:
"
"Associated with a causative factor:
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog, including a standard blood chemical profile, complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis so as to rule out other causes of disease. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. Clotting profiles should be performed on a blood sample to verify for delayed clotting times.
"
"The packed cell volume, hemoglobin and platelet count will be lower than normal. The blood chemical profile may show signs of liver failure (which would cause bleeding into bodily cavities since clotting factors would not be produced).
"
"The fluid in the chest should be sampled and analyzed at a laboratory for a comparison with peripheral blood. Platelets are often found in chest fluid samples.
"
"X-rays are crucial for visualizing the extent of the fluid build-up in the chest, the collapse of lung lobes, and any masses that might be present in the chest cavity. An ultrasound of the chest can reveal a diseased condition with an even greater sensitivity than an x-ray image would.
"

"Hematuria is a condition which causes blood to fall into the urine, and which may indicate a serious underlying disease process. Familial hematuria (a condition in which blood in the urine runs in certain families of animals) is usually implicated in young dogs, while cancer is the usual cause in older dogs. Females are at greater risk for urinary tract infections that lead to blood in the urine than are males.
"
"Symptoms of hematuria include blood in the urine, a sign in itself. Red-tinged urine, with or without abnormal frequent passage of urine will be evident. In patients with cancer, a mass may be palpated during physical examination. In male dogs an enlarged and/or painful prostate gland may be felt during physical examination, and abdominal pain will be evident in some patients.
"
"Patients with a blood-clotting disorder may present with subdermal skin hemorrhages, conditions known as petechiae and ecchymoses, which appear as bruises. These discolored spots will be indicated by round, purplish, non-raised patches on the skin.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, with a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. In male dogs, examination of an ejaculate sample will help to identify prostatic disease.
"
"Differential diagnoses for blood-tinged urine will include other causes for discolored urine. The common urine reagent strip tests for blood are designed to detect red blood cells, hemoglobin, or protein. Diet will also be considered. If you are supplementing your dog's diet with vitamins or anything different from a regular kibble diet, you will need to share this with your veterinarian, since substantial doses of vitamin C (ascorbic aid) may cause false-negative reagent test strip results.
"
"Ultrasonography, radiography, and contrast radiography may be useful in obtaining a diagnosis. If any mass lesions are indicated, a biopsy may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. A vaginoscopy in female dogs, or a cystoscopy in male dogs will rule out neoplasia and lower urinary tract issues.
"
"
"
"Patients suffering from hemothorax should be treated on an inpatient basis. Your dog must receive fluid therapy to correct its blood loss into the chest cavity. If your dog also has air free (outside the lungs) in the chest cavity, this must be immediately corrected. If the lungs are bruised, ventilator support may be necessary. These patients often also need oxygen therapy, and will need to be kept warm to prevent shock. If your dog’s blood sample has a delayed clotting time, then a plasma or blood transfusion may be needed to restore clotting factors or to provide red blood cells for oxygen transport. Severe or recurrent thoracic hemorrhage may require surgical exploration.
"
"While your dog is recovering from hemothorax, it is probably best to avoid giving it any aspirin or other over the counter medications that can lead to decreased blood clotting. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary to treat your dog’s underlying condition. If your dog shows signs of a recurrence of hemothorax, notify your veterinarian immediately; surgery may be necessary to correct recurring cases.

"Treatment of the hematuria will be dependent on the primary or associated diseases that are the underlying cause for the condition. Urinary tract infection may be associated with another disease involving the urinary tract, such as cancer, or urinary tract stones (urolithiasis). Or, hematuria may be caused by a condition that involves the body in general, such as with an excessive production of steroids by the adrenal glands, or diabetes. A systemic generalized condition will need to be treated before the hematuria can be resolved.
"
"Surgery may be indicated for cases with urinary tract stones, neoplasia, and traumatic injuries to the urinary tract. Blood transfusions may be necessary if your dog has a severely low red blood cell count. Fluids will be used to treat dehydration, and dog antibiotics can be used to treat urinary tract infection and generalized diseases due to bacteria in the blood (bacteremia). Urolithiasis and kidney failure may require diet modification top prevent relapse.
"
"If your dog is suffering from a clotting disorder, the blood thinner Heparin may be used to bring it under control.
"
"Because hematuria may indicate a serious underlying disease process, ongoing treatment will be dependent on the primary or associated diseases that are related to it.

"Bloat in dogs is a condition in which food or gas stretches a pup’s stomach, causing abdominal pain. While it’s more common in large breed or deep-chested dogs, any breed can develop bloat.
"
"When bloat occurs, a dog’s stomach begins to expand, or distend, and cuts off blood flow to the abdomen as well as the stomach itself. This may cause injury or death of the stomach wall and without treatment, other organs. Bloat can also put pressure on the diaphragm, a thin muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. This can cause difficulty breathing in dogs.  
"
"In severe cases of bloat, a dog’s stomach flips, or twists, and fills with gas. This is called gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV).
"
"Bloat with GDV cuts off blood flow to a pup’s stomach and the lower half of their body, making it impossible for food to pass into the intestine. In extreme cases of GDV, a dog’s stomach can rupture, and the spleen can also be injured. 
"
"All cases of bloat are medical emergencies, and require veterinary intervention to determine the severity. If untreated, a dog with GDV will die within hours. If bloat and GDV are treated immediately, they are often curable.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Bloat is an uncomfortable and painful condition. Symptoms of bloat in dogs include:
"
"Dry-heaving (also called retching) without vomiting any food. Sometimes a dog might spit out white foam when trying to vomit, which is usually mucus from the esophagus or stomach.
"
"Abdominal swelling (this might not be visible in the early stages of bloat)
"
"Sudden anxiety, pacing, an inability to get comfortable or constantly moving around the room/house.
"
"Positioning the body in a downward-facing pose, where the dog’s back half is up, and upper half is down
"
"Panting and drooling
"
"Collapse
"
"Rapid heart rate (tachycardia)
"
"Pale gums
"
"It’s unknown why bloat and GDV occurs in dogs.
"
"While these conditions can affect in any pup, there are suspected risk factors that can increase the chance of bloat in dogs. These include:
"
"Dogs that ingest large amounts of food or water too quickly
"
"Dogs that weigh more than 99 pounds
"
"Dogs that are male
"
"Dogs that are older
"
"Dogs that are of large breeds and deep-chested 
"
"Dogs that exercise immediately after eating 
"
"Dogs that eat from an elevated food bowl
"
"Dogs with a family history of bloat
"
"Dogs that eat dry food with fat or oil listed in the first four ingredients
"
"A veterinarian may suspect bloat and/or GDV by simply seeing a dog’s distressed behavior and physical appearance, but they usually perform tests to confirm the diagnosis. 
"
"Veterinarians diagnose bloat in dogs with:
"
"Abdominal X-rays—These are taken to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the severity of bloat.
"
"An X-ray can indicate if a dog has simple bloat, where the stomach appears very distended and round and is usually full of food or gas. X-rays also show if bloat has progressed to GDV. They will show if the stomach is distended and has a “bubble” on top of the swollen stomach (sometimes referred to as a “double bubble”).  
"
"Blood work—Your vet may perform blood tests to get an understanding of your dog’s overall health.  
"
"If caught in time, bloat is curable. However, treatment of bloat in dogs depends on the severity.
"
"There are no home remedies for bloat in dogs. Dogs with simple bloat are usually hospitalized to receive of intravenous (IV) fluids and medication for pain or nausea as needed. They’re also walked often to stimulate movement of the gastrointestinal tract to help move the gas and food quickly through the body.
"
"A dog with GDV requires more intense care. This typically includes: 
"
"IV fluids with electrolytes to aggressively treat shock and improve circulation to vital organs.
"
"Pain medications and antibiotics to treat discomfort, shock, and any death of tissues from the loss of circulation.
"
"Trocharization, a procedure often used to decompress the air out of the stomach to restore the blood flow.  
"
"Electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor for any heart abnormalities.
"
"Surgery, which is performed as soon as the dog is stable. Depending on the severity of bloat, a vet may have to untwist the dog’s stomach and/or spleen. They may also remove any part of the stomach wall that has died due to loss of blood flow. The vet will also stitch the stomach to the body wall in a procedure called a gastropexy. This significantly reduces the risk of rotation of the stomach in the future.  
"
"After diagnosis, dogs with simple bloat tend to bounce back into their normal lives and routines one to two days after receiving fluids and taking frequent walks. 
"
"Following a gastropexy procedure, a dog will remain in the hospital until their pain is controlled and the dog is eating and drinking normally on their own.
"
"The duration of a pup’s hospital stay depends on their health history and severity of bloat. Their stay may be anywhere from one to two days, to up to seven or more.
"
"Follow your vet’s discharge instructions regarding surgical aftercare. This includes typically 10 to 14 days of rest, monitoring the incision, and giving oral medications. It may be useful to purchase a cone or recovery suit to help keep your pup from licking/chewing at their surgical incision during recovery. 
"
"You can lower the risk of your dog developing bloat by doing the following:
"
"Never leave large bags or bins of food accessible to your dog to avoid overeating. 
"
"Do not use raised food bowls unless advised by your veterinarian (some pets require a raised food bowl due to a medical condition).
"
"Have your dog wait at least one hour after a meal or drinking a large amount of water for any exercise or playtime.
"
"Feed your pup small meals a few times throughout the day instead of one or two large meals.
"
"Don’t allow your dog to gorge on water when drinking.
"
"Discuss preventative surgery with your veterinarian for breeds at higher risk of bloat. This can often be performed during your pet’s spay or neuter procedure.
"
"If purchasing a pup from a breeder, be sure to ask if there is any family history of bloat or GDV.
"
"If your dog is experiencing bloat, they require immediate medical attention. If the bloat is distension only and the stomach has not twisted (GDV), your vet will treat your pup with fluids, medications, and increased walking. If your dog’s stomach has twisted, emergency surgery will likely be required.
"
"Yes. While bloat and GDV are both medical emergencies and potentially life-threatening, with fast medical intervention they can make a complete recovery.
"
"It’s important to get your dog emergency veterinary care—one to two hours can be the difference between a good and bad prognosis. 
"
"No specific foods cause bloat in dogs. Large amounts of food and water or exercising after a large meal are more significant concerns.
"
"Research shows that dry dog foods that list oils or fats among the first four labeled ingredients may predispose dogs to GDV.

"Dogs sometimes lose their vision in one or both of their eyes, often due to an eye disease or injury. Additionally, a dog may lose their sight if their brain becomes diseased or injured, as the eyes and brain seek to detect and interpret images. Blindness in dogs can manifest suddenly or develop gradually over time.
"
"The prevalence of blindness in dogs is difficult to determine because many conditions can lead to it. Blindness is more prevalent in middle-aged and senior dogs than in young dogs.
"
"While blindness itself is not usually life-threatening, some underlying causes of blindness can be. If your dog goes blind suddenly or experiences eye trauma, seek emergency veterinary care.
"
"If your dog’s vision or eye appearance changes—even subtly—schedule a visit with your vet.
"
"You may not be able to tell that a dog is blind simply by looking at them, but they may behave differently than a dog whose sight is not impaired.
"
"A blind dog often bumps into objects and becomes lost in familiar places. They may no longer jump onto furniture or use the stairs. Additionally, they may not respond normally by blinking in response to an object, such as your hand, near their eyes. 
"
"In addition to behavioral changes, changes in the appearance of a dog’s eyes may be a sign that they are losing their sight. Depending on the underlying cause of a dog’s blindness, their eyes’ appearance may change in one or more of the following ways:
"
"White, blue, or hazy eye color
"
"Eye redness
"
"Eye bulging
"
"Dilated pupils
"
"Increased green eye reflection
"
"Squinting
"
"A dog can lose their sight due to illness or injury. Some of the many diseases and conditions that can lead to blindness in dogs include:
"
"A cataract affects the eye’s lens, a normally clear structure that sits behind the colored part of the eye (the iris) and the pupil opening. As a cataract develops, it hardens the lens, which becomes white, obstructing your dog’s vision. Cataracts can occur at any age but they are more common in older dogs and in those with diabetes.
"
"The eye is constantly creating and draining fluid to maintain a standard pressure. Glaucoma develops when an eye’s drainage system clogs, either from a congenital defect (one present at birth) or from another eye disease. As your dog’s eye pressure rises, they experience pain. The nerve cells at the back of their eye—which are responsible for vision—are damaged.
"
"When a dog’s eye pressure either spikes extremely high or remains higher than normal for a long period, they can become blind. Certain purebred dogs, including English and American Cocker Spaniels, Siberian Huskies, Chow Chows, Beagles, and Basset Hounds, may have a genetic predisposition to developing glaucoma.
"
"Uveitis, or inflammation in the eye’s front portion, can occur as the result of an eye infection, cancer, or an autoimmune condition. Inflammatory cells can clog the normal drain system and lead to glaucoma or can trigger inflammation in the back of the eye, subsequently causing blindness. Any dog can develop uveitis.
"
"Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a retinal disease characterized by the deterioration of the cell layer lining the back of the eye that detects light. It can affect one or both eyes.
"
"With PRA, a dog’s retina deteriorates over months or years, eventually causing blindness. This process is painless, and no treatment is available. PRA is genetic, and many breeds are at risk, including Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Toy, Miniature, and Standard Poodles, Tibetan, English, and American Cocker Spaniels, and Tibetan and Yorkshire Terriers.
"
"Sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome (SARDS) is a type of PRA that occurs over hours or days rather than months or years. SARDS’s causes are not well understood, but middle-aged female dogs and Dachshunds, Pugs, Miniature Schnauzers, and Brittany Spaniels seem to have a high risk of the disease.
"
"Research links SARDS with some endocrine disorders, but more research is needed for veterinarians to understand this relationship. SARDS causes permanent blindness in both eyes.
"
"In addition to developing degenerative diseases, the retina can detach from the back of a dog’s eye, causing immediate and sudden—but usually painless—blindness in one or both eyes.
"
"A Shih Tzu’s retina can detach for no apparent reason. Other potential retinal detachment causes in dogs include immune system problems, eye surgery or injury, and high blood pressure.
"
"Severe eye injury or trauma can cause a dog to lose their sight. Bleeding inside the eye, eye rupture, eye swelling, eye displacement (proptosis), and lens dislocation are eye traumas that can cause a dog’s blindness.
"
"An injury that begins as a minor problem, such as a corneal abrasion, can progress to cause eventual blindness if the eye becomes infected or inflamed.
"
"Sometimes, brain disease or injury can cause a dog’s blindness. Inflammation in the optic nerve, which transmits signals from the retina to the brain, is one cause of neurologic blindness.
"
"Other causes include brain tumors, infections, and congenital brain malformations. Neurologic blindness is most likely to occur in middle-aged and older dogs.
"
"Veterinarians diagnose blindness in dogs by taking a complete history and performing a series of vision assessment tests, such as checking the dog’s response to light and movement and watching them navigate an unfamiliar room.
"
"Your vet will also perform a complete physical exam, check the pressure inside your pup’s eyes, and use a dye-containing eye drop to look for injuries.
"
"Additional tests may be ordered if your veterinarian suspects that an illness or infection led to your pet’s blindness. If your dog has lost their sight, your veterinarian may perform one or more of the following tests:
"
"Blood work
"
"Infectious disease testing
"
"Urinalysis
"
"X-rays
"
"If the cause of your dog’s blindness is unclear, your vet may refer you to a specialist. A veterinary ophthalmologist can perform a more thorough eye exam and specialized testing, including an electroretinogram (ERG) or a retinal function test.
"
"A visit with a veterinary neurologist may be necessary if your dog’s brain-health status is in question.
"
"You can help your veterinarian determine why your dog has lost their sight by being prepared to answer their questions about your pet’s health and behavior history. Note when your dog’s symptoms began; whether the blindness occurred suddenly or over several days, weeks, or months; and any changes in your dog’s behavior and eye appearance.
"
"The treatment for a dog’s blindness will depend on the condition’s underlying cause. Once a dog loses their sight the blindness is often permanent, and treatments are directed at reducing pain rather than restoring vision.
"
"If your dog goes blind in one eye and the other eye is also at risk, your veterinarian may be able to help prevent or slow vision loss in the sighted eye through treatment.
"
"A dog experiencing progressive blindness as a result of retinal degeneration or slow cataract formation may benefit from the supplement Ocu-GLO®, which contains vitamins and strong antioxidants vets believe may slow progressive ophthalmic conditions.
"
"If the blind eye has no chance of regaining vision and is causing your dog significant pain, your veterinarian may perform eye removal surgery, which is often the best treatment option. If your veterinarian thinks vision recovery is possible, treatments may include:
"
"If a systemic health condition, such as high blood pressure, brain disease, or a fungal infection, has caused your dog’s blindness, your veterinarian will prescribe treatments specific to those conditions. Additional treatments specifically directed at the eye may also be recommended.
"
"As noted, if your dog becomes blind, they may not regain their sight. Even if the cause of your dog’s blindness is reversible, such as cataracts, you should be prepared for the possibility that your dog will remain blind or may lose their vision again. However, dogs can live full, happy lives without vision.
"
"Recovery should focus on keeping your dog comfortable and managing their pain. If an illness is causing your pup’s blindness, follow your vet’s instructions regarding nutrition, medications, and follow-up appointments. Keep your pet in a small, cozy area free from obstacles and stairs.
"
"Once your dog is feeling better, you can begin to help them adapt to their vision loss.
"
"Allow your dog to navigate small areas of your home using their other senses, and resist the urge to pick them up and carry them around, which will only disorient your pup. You can walk by your dog’s side to redirect them gently if they need help and encouragement to continue exploring.
"
"If a dog loses their vision gradually, they are likely to adapt well and not need much extra help.
"
"However, a dog who loses their vision suddenly will need more support. You can make your home safer by using mats with different textures to mark doorways and stairwells and supervising stair use until your pet can navigate on their own. Keep a harness or head collar on your dog so you can guide them more easily if needed. Always talk to your dog before you touch them and avoid awakening them suddenly.
"
"To alert others around you of your dog’s condition, use collars, leashes, and harnesses that indicate your dog is blind. This helps prevent people and their dogs from startling your pet. Other helpful items for blind dogs include a halo harness that provides a face-protecting bumper bar, and balls or other toys that make noise during play.
"
"Depending on your dog’s condition, your veterinarian may be unable to prevent them from becoming blind. However, by ensuring your pup receives regular veterinary exams and preventive care visits, your vet may be able to detect your dog’s eye problem in the early stages and start treatment before the issue worsens.
"
"If behavior changes in your pup indicate their vision is impaired or if their eyes’ appearance changes, make an appointment with your vet.
"
"Most causes of blindness are irreversible, meaning the blindness is permanent. However, you should take your dog to the vet if you notice any eye changes or signs of vision loss. If your dog’s sight impairment is reversible, they have the best chance of regaining their vision when your veterinarian begins treatment right away.
"
"Products containing high levels of antioxidants may slow the progression of cataracts or PRA. If a corneal problem is diagnosed, your veterinarian may prescribe specific eye drops to slow disease progression. Do not stop administering your dog’s eye medications without first consulting your veterinarian.
"
"If the cause of your dog’s blindness is reversible, such as cataracts or some forms of retinal detachment, surgery may restore their vision. Only veterinary ophthalmology specialists perform these surgeries. Costs vary depending on where you live, but you can expect to pay between $2,000 and $10,000.
"
"A blind dog can continue to do many of the activities they enjoyed while they were fully sighted, including going on walks. Choose one or two walking routes and stick to them exactly each time, so your dog’s brain can mentally map and navigate each route. Teach your dog cues, including “step,” “stop,” “left,” and “right,” to help guide them.

"The retina is the innermost lining of the eye, laying just beneath the middle choroid coat, which in turn lies between the retina and the sclera – the white lining of the outer eye. The choroid coat contains connective tissue and blood vessels, which deliver nutrients and oxygen to the outer layers of the retina. In some cases the retina may separate from this layer. This is termed retinal detachment. Retinal hemorrhage is a condition in which the innermost lining of the eye has a local or generalized area of bleeding into that lining. The causes of retinal hemorrhage are usually genetic and breed specific.
"
"Genetic (present at birth):
"
"Acquired (condition that develops sometime later in life/after birth):
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Standard laboratory tests include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, a blood pressure test and a urinalysis, so as to rule out other causes of disease.
"
"The physical exam will entail a full ophthalmic exam using a slit lamp microscope. During this exam, the retina at the back of the eye will be closely observed for abnormalities. The electrical activity of the retina will also be measured. An ultrasound of the eye may also be done if the retina cannot be visualized due to hemorrhaging. Samples of vitreous humor (eye fluid) may be taken for laboratory analysis. Genetic testing may also be done if your dog belongs to a breed that is prone to familial retinal disease.
"
"
"
"Blastomycosis, sometimes called “Blasto,” is a systemic disease (a disease that can affect the entire body) caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. The fungus is found in soil, where moisture and decomposing matter—such as leaves, feces, and other organic material—are commonly found. Because moisture is required for its growth, the fungus is commonly found in areas near water.
"
"The fungus starts as mold in the environment and creates spores—tiny reproductive cells that can spread into the air. Spores release in the air whenever the soil they live in is disturbed. Spores can then be inhaled into a dog’s airways or embedded in the skin, where it can develop into blastomycosis.
"
"The warmth of the host’s body allows the spores to transform into a budding yeast. The yeast colonizes the lungs or skin, and from there can spread to the bloodstream and infect other organs. The organs most likely to be affected are:
"
"Lungs/respiratory system
"
"Skin and subcutaneous tissue
"
"Eyes
"
"Bones
"
"Lymph nodes 
"
"Brain
"
"Testes
"
"Patients with retinal hemorrhage are usually hospitalized and given close care by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Your veterinarian will prescribe medications depending on the underlying cause of disease. Surgery can sometimes be performed to reattach the retina to the choroid coat.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule frequent follow-up appointments for your dog to chart the deterioration or progress (post-surgically) of the retina and the underlying disease that caused it to detach. Repeat bloodwork and ophthalmic exams will be performed during these visits. If your dog does become blind as a result of the retinal detachment, remember that once the underlying cause of disease has been controlled, the eye will no longer be painful to your dog. Although the blindness may not be reversed, your dog can still lead a happy and fulfilling life indoors as it learns to compensate with its other senses and memorizes the layout of the home.
"
"As your dog will be more vulnerable without its sight, you will need to take extra care to protect your dog from harmful situations, such as with other pets and active children. Never allow your blind dog outside on its own, and keep a watchful eye on the dog at all times while outside.

"
"Less common targets are the prostate, liver, mammary glands, and heart.
"
"As the disease progresses, the yeast colonizes and infects additional organs. Once three or more organs are involved, the dog’s prognosis is typically poor. If the disease is caught early and symptoms are mild, most dogs respond well to treatment. 
"
"The signs of blastomycosis are dependent on which organs are involved. In about 85% of cases, affected dogs first have a dry, harsh cough. In as many as 50% of cases, they will have skin nodules with pus. Owners of dogs visiting or living in areas close to water should watch out for the following symptoms:
"
"Respiratory issues, including coughing, difficulty breathing, and nasal discharge (especially bloody nasal discharge)
"
"Draining skin nodules/lesions
"
"Fever
"
"Swollen lymph nodes
"
"Weight loss or lack of appetite
"
"Eye issues, such as inflammation, blindness, or swelling
"
"Urinary issues, including bloody urine, difficulty urinating, or enlarged testicles in males
"
"Neurological signs, such as head tilts and seizures
"
"Lameness/limping 
"
"In most cases, skin lesions and respiratory problems are the earliest symptoms of blastomycosis in dogs.
"
"Blastomycosis typically occurs when soil contaminated with the fungus is disturbed, allowing airborne spores to be inhaled by the dog. Sporting or hunting dogs are at an increased risk, as they are more often in these contaminated areas. In addition, the spores can enter through the skin. Areas that consist of water and decomposing matter, or were recently disturbed due to construction, increase the risk of exposure to the disease. 
"
"A complete physical examination with a detailed history is helpful for diagnosis of blastomycosis. It can often be mistaken for other conditions, so it’s important for a vet to rule out any other common conditions during diagnosis.
"
" Your veterinarian may start with the following:
"
"Blood tests
"
"Imaging (radiographs, ultrasound, or CT scan) to examine the lungs
"
"Urinalysis to look for yeast
"
"Cultures
"
"Serology
"
"Biopsies
"
"Definitive diagnosis can be obtained by finding the organism in tissue, or through biopsies or an aspiration from skin lesions. (An aspiration is when a small sample of an area is collected through a needle and sent out for further analysis.)
"
"It’s important to provide your veterinarian with any information about where your dog has been, in case it’s an area of high-risk for exposure. Be sure to mention any recent vacations or trips with your pet.
"
"Antifungal medications are typically prescribed for blastomycosis and are given orally. They often must o be given for several months, but your dog can be treated at home if the illness is not severe.
"
"Dogs with difficulty breathing may require oxygen therapy and hospitalization until they improve. In severe cases, or when medication does not work, prolonged hospital stays, intravenous medications, and further care may be required.
"
"Dogs whose eyes are severely affected may not respond well to treatment and may require topical medications. If significantly affected, the eye may need to be surgically removed.  
"
"There is no way to prevent blastomycosis, aside from avoiding high-risk areas where the fungus may be  present. The prognosis for most dogs is positive, if treatment is provided as soon as symptoms start and medication is given correctly.
"
"Pets with severe lung disease may appear worse at the beginning of treatment because the fungal organisms are dying. They may not improve for one to two weeks after the start of treatment, and so close monitoring should be done during this time, regardless of any additional underlying condition.
"
"Once the organism affects the brain, seizures are common and may be uncontrollable. Dogs with brain involvement often die, and if more than three body systems become involved (meaning the disease has spread), the prognosis is typically poor.
"
"Relapse can occur in dogs with very severe cases of blastomycosis or those for whom treatment was stopped too soon. These relapses are most common within the first 6 months after treatment.
"
"It is unlikely that once recovered from the disease, the dog will be completely immune. Routine veterinary appointments, including annual exams, are critical to ensure the health and safety of your pet.
"
"Prognosis is poor without long-term treatment. The disease will continue to progress without intervention.
"
"Blastomycosis cannot be spread to humans from dogs through the air, such as breathing or coughing. However, blood transmission, for example through a dog bite, can occur. Care should be taken to change and dispose of bandages and bandage materials by using proper protective wear, such as gloves. This is especially true for those who are immunocompromised, as there is a risk of inhalation of the fungus forming on bandages.
"
"A dog may contract blastomycosis when soil contaminated with the fungus is disrupted and the spores are released and inhaled or enter through the skin.

"Polypoid cystitis is a condition marked by a chronically inflamed and/or infected urinary bladder. This disease is characterized by polypoid (round and fleshy) protrusions scattered over the surface of the bladder. These protrusions can lead to ulcers in the lining of the urinary bladder, which will result in occasional blood in the urine.
"
"Dogs suffering from chronic urinary tract infections, or urinary bladder stones, are most at risk for developing polypoid cystitis.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.
"
"Cystoscopy (going into the bladder with a small camera), or cystotomy (surgery to open the bladder) is essential for obtaining a diagnosis of polypoid cystitis. Cystotomy or cystoscopy will show bloody, polypoid lesions over the bladder surface that cannot be visually differentiated from transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), a grave cancer of the bladder. A biopsy (tissue removal for examination) of the polyps will need to be performed for differentiation, and will be obtained during the cystoscopic procedure.
"
"A sample of urine from the bladder will also need to be cultured, and will be removed by sterile catheterization, or at the time of cystoscopy. Another procedure that can be used to draw urine out of the bladder is cystocentesis, which uses a needle to perform the task, but it will not be used unless TCC has been ruled out.
"
"Double-contrast cystography, and positive contrast cystography (both methods use injection of a dye that shows up on x-ray examination), are the best methods for visually examining the interior of the bladder. This method may reveal irregular polyploid masses in the bladder, and/or a thickened bladder wall. Ultrasound imaging can also be used for this purpose, and may show polypoid/mass-like lesions along the lining of the bladder.
"
"
"
"Treatment will involve removal of the polyps, either by entering the bladder through the urinary tract (cystoscopy), or through surgically opening the bladder (cystotomy). Polyps can be individually removed using one of these methods. Partial surgical removal of the bladder may be required to remove the affected area of the bladder, and further treatment of the underlying cause for the chronic inflammation may prevent recurrence of the polyps. If a urinary tract infection is occurring at the same time, this condition will also be resolved with antibiotics, which will be prescribed based on a culture of urine and polyp tissue. Antibiotics should be administered for at least four to six weeks.
"
"Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up appointment with you seven to ten days after antibiotic therapy has begun in order to culture your pet’s urine. Again, seven days after antibiotic therapy has ended, urine should be removed from your pet via cystocentesis (using a sterile needle) for urinalysis and culturing. This should be repeated again one month after antibiotic therapy has ended. Your veterinarian will want to follow your dog’s progress by examining the urinary tract by ultrasound at one, three, and six months after the initial treatment. The prognosis for this condition is generally favorable.
"
"Cancer can develop in a dog’s urinary tract, including in the kidneys, ureters, prostate, and urethra. However, cancer of the urinary tract in dogs most commonly occurs in the bladder. Bladder cancer in dogs typically grows quickly and can metastasize (spread) to other parts of a dog’s body.
"
"While bladder cancer constitutes only about 2% of canine cancers, the condition is usually incurable and causes significant problems for affected dogs.
"
"Bladder cancer types that affect dogs include transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and leiomyosarcomas (LMS), with TCC being by far the most common.
"
"Transitional cells line the urinary bladder, protecting a dog’s body from the urine’s harsh chemicals in the urine. In dogs, TCC develops from these cells and often also invades the deeper bladder structures, including the muscle layers, which may also affect the kidneys, ureters, prostate (in males), and urethra.
"
"As the cancer grows, urine flow can become obstructed, and the cancer can spread to the dog’s lymph nodes and other organs.
"
"Bladder cancer symptoms are similar to those seen in dogs affected by urinary tract infections and other urinary tract conditions. Bladder cancer signs include:
"
"Blood in the urine
"
"Straining to urinate
"
"Frequently urinating small amounts

"Blepharitis is a condition that causes inflammation (swelling) of the eyelid and/or the edges of the eyelid. Blepharitis causes discomfort in dogs, but since it does not pose an immediate threat to your dog’s vision or overall health, it is not considered an emergency.  
"
"Most cases of blepharitis will require treatment with prescription medication, so if you see swelling in your dog’s eyelid, take your dog to a vet so they can be examined and a treatment plan can be created. Cases of blepharitis that are not treated appropriately will result in severe scarring of the eyelid, which may stop the eyelid from working correctly and later result in injury to the eye itself. 
"
"The most common symptoms of blepharitis in dogs include: 
"
"Swelling 
"
"Redness 
"
"Hair loss on eyelid skin 
"
"Squinting

"
"Most causes of bladder cancer in dogs can’t be identified. However, certain factors increase a dog’s risk of bladder cancer, including:
"
"Age—Bladder cancer is more common in dogs 10 years of age and older.
"
"Sex—Female dogs have a higher TCC risk than male dogs, possibly because they urine mark less frequently and therefore toxins stay in the urinary bladder longer.
"
"Breed—Scottish Terriers have an 18- to 20-fold higher TCC risk than other dog breeds, while Shetland Sheepdogs, Beagles, West Highland Terriers, and Wire Hair Fox Terriers have a three- to five-times higher risk than other dog breeds.
"
"Body condition—Obese and overweight dogs have an increased risk of developing bladder cancer.
"
"Chemotherapy—Certain chemotherapy treatments can cause bladder cancer in dogs.
"
"Environmental factors— 
"
"Certain pesticides and insecticides—such as those found in flea dips used in the past—have been linked to bladder cancer. Exposure to lawn herbicides and pesticides may also be a contributing factor.
"
"Additionally, some studies suggest that secondhand smoke can increase a dog’s bladder cancer risk. This is attributed to the carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) found in tobacco smoke, which, when inhaled, can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Once excreted in urine, these substances directly affect the bladder, potentially leading to damage and an elevated risk of bladder cancer.
"
"Because other urinary tract issues can cause symptoms similar to bladder cancer, your veterinarian will need to perform a bladder tissue biopsy to make a definitive diagnosis. Other tests your vet may recommend include:
"
"Blood work—Blood work, including a complete blood count (CBC) and biochemistry profile, can help assess your dog’s overall health and detect infection and kidney abnormalities.
"
"Urinalysis and culture—Urinalysis and urine culture are important to rule out a urinary tract infection and other potential urinary tract issues such as bladder stones.
"
"X-rays—X-rays can detect bladder stones. However, they can’t detect bladder tumors unless your veterinarian administers a special contrast dye to your dog.
"
"Ultrasound—Ultrasound is a noninvasive way to visualize stones, polyps, and tumors inside the bladder.
"
"BRAF mutation test—A urine test is available that detects a specific mutation in the BRAF gene. However, this test isn’t always accurate.
"
"Antibiotic trial—Before performing a urinary bladder biopsy, your veterinarian may recommend an antibiotic trial to see if your dog’s signs resolve with treatment.
"
"If your dog is diagnosed with bladder cancer, your vet may perform tumor staging to determine the prognosis and how best to treat the condition.
"
"Your vet will typically repeat tumor staging tests during your dog’s treatment to determine whether the prescribed treatment is working or the disease is progressing. Your vet can stage your dog’s tumor using:
"
"X-rays—Your vet will perform chest and abdominal X-rays to look for tumor changes or growth, including spread to new areas (i.e., metastasis).
"
"Ultrasound—Abdominal ultrasound helps determine the tumor’s location and size, as well as kidney abnormalities that may result from obstructed urine flow.
"
"Bladder cancer treatment depends on the tumor’s size and location, and if metastasis has occurred. Bladder cancer treatment options may include:
"
"Surgery—For a small tumor that isn’t close to the bladder neck, surgery may be possible. The bladder neck is a muscular region where the bladder connects to the urethra, and it acts as a valve that helps control the release of urine from the bladder.
"
"During this procedure, a margin of normal tissue around the tumor is removed to prevent tumor regrowth. Unfortunately, most TCCs in dogs are located in the bladder neck, and surgery is usually not possible.
"
"Excessive ocular discharge (pus or mucus coming from the eye) 
"
"Certain types of blepharitis can also cause itchiness, which will make your dog try to rub their face with their paws or on nearby surfaces. Severe cases of blepharitis can result in ulcers and sores on the skin. 
"
"Blepharitis in dogs can be the result of infection with bacteria, fungus, or parasites. It can also be caused by autoimmune diseases, where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the eyelid tissue. Certain types of cancer may also cause blepharitis.  
"
"One of the most common causes of blepharitis in dogs is allergies. These allergies can be due to environmental irritants (like grass, pollen, mold, or dust) or sometimes your dog’s food.  
"
" 
"
"Blepharitis is diagnosed based on signs including swollen, red, and irritated eyelid skin. Your veterinarian may recommend plucking a few hairs or swabbing/scraping the skin for samples to check for bacteria or parasites. In other cases, the vet may do a culture of the skin to diagnose a bacterial or fungal infection.  
"
"If your vet suspects the cause is related to an autoimmune disease, they might do a biopsy of the eyelid tissue. In this procedure, a small section of tissue is removed and examined for abnormalities. Finally, a positive response to medication can also sometimes confirm a suspected cause.  
"
"Where possible, treatment of blepharitis is aimed at fixing the underlying cause. For bacterial infections, that may mean treatment with topical or oral antibiotics, as well as topical or oral anti-inflammatory medications to treat the pain and inflammation.  
"
"Similarly, fungal and parasitic infections are treated with anti-fungal medications and parasiticides, respectively. Cleaning of the eyelid skin with safe-for-the-eye cleansers is also helpful when treating infectious cases of blepharitis.  
"
"Autoimmune causes of blepharitis are treated using medications that suppress the immune system. This kind of therapy must be continued for the rest of your dog’s life to keep the disease controlled. If you stop treatment, the symptoms will return.  
"
"Allergic causes of blepharitis are sometimes treated with short courses of steroids or medications like cyclosporine for longer therapy. In cases of underlying food allergies, blepharitis can be resolved by changing your dog’s diet and avoiding certain ingredients.     
"
"Targeted therapy for blepharitis results in quick improvement of symptoms. Dogs with infectious causes of blepharitis do extremely well once treated with the right medication and are not at risk of developing problems in the future. When blepharitis is caused by autoimmune disease or an allergy, pets must often continue some degree of medical therapy for the long term to control symptoms.  
"
"Blepharitis will usually improve within a few days of starting the right therapy. Most clinical signs will be controlled completely after two weeks of treatment. Autoimmune and allergy-related forms of blepharitis may require long-term therapy or symptoms will return. 
"
"The fastest way to cure blepharitis is to start specific, targeted therapy. The best way to do this is by having your vet perform diagnostic testing to find the underlying cause of the inflammation (swelling). 
"
"Blepharitis treatment should be performed under the direction of a licensed veterinarian. Topical cleaners and medications must be chosen carefully to avoid damaging the nearby cornea and ocular surface (outer layer of the eye). Delay in seeking treatment for blepharitis can result in permanent scarring of the eyelid skin and the area around the eyelid.

"
"Radiation—In the past, radiation therapy for bladder cancer often caused side effects such as a scarred, shrunken bladder or irritation to a dog’s surrounding organs. However, advanced imaging available at specialty hospitals can allow veterinarians to better target a tumor.
"
"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)—NSAIDs are typically used to alleviate pain, but these drugs also seem to have anti-cancer effects. In one study, dogs given the NSAID piroxicam exhibited good results, including 3% of dogs who experienced complete remission, 14% of dogs whose tumor size shrunk by more than 50%, and 56% of dogs who experienced no tumor growth during the study period. NSAIDs can be used alone or combined with more aggressive chemotherapy drugs.
"
"Chemotherapy—Chemotherapy drugs (systemic) are often used to treat bladder cancer in dogs. These drugs tend to have only mild side effects.
"
"Antibiotics—Bladder cancer increases a dog’s urinary tract infection risk. Your veterinarian can manage these infections with antibiotics.
"
"Stents—If a bladder tumor obstructs your dog’s urine outflow, your veterinarian may recommend placing a stent in the urethra to restore your dog’s urine flow.
"
"Regardless of treatment, your veterinarian will likely monitor your dog every four to eight weeks to assess the treatment’s efficacy. During this time, dogs may have urinary accidents at home, and puppy pads may be useful to facilitate cleanup.
"
"In most cases, bladder cancer is incurable, but treatment can allow a dog to live longer and enjoy a better quality of life than without treatment. The prognosis depends on the tumor’s size, growth rate, and location, and whether the cancer has spread.
"
"Survival times vary widely, with some dogs living only a few days after diagnosis and some living two years or longer.
"
"Steps to decrease a dog’s bladder cancer risk include:
"
"Avoid older-generation flea control products such as flea dips.
"
"Avoid treating your lawn with herbicides and pesticides.
"
"Keep your dog at a healthy body weight.
"
"Feed your dog yellow or orange vegetables and leafy greens at least three times a week, as these are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
"
"Eliminate your dog’s exposure to tobacco smoke—don’t smoke in the house.
"
"Only a veterinarian can differentiate a urinary tract infection from bladder cancer. Your vet may perform various diagnostic tests, such as urinalysis, imaging studies, and biopsy, examining cells under a microscope, to accurately distinguish between the two conditions.
"
"Deciding when to euthanize is difficult and depends on many factors. However, generally, humane euthanasia should be considered when a dog’s quality of life suffers and they have more bad days than good ones.
"
"Bladder cancer in dogs is typically incurable.
"
"A dog’s survival time from the point of diagnosis can vary widely, ranging from a few days to two years or more, depending on factors such as the tumor’s size, location, growth rate, and the occurrence of metastasis (spreading).

"Dystocia is the medical term used to diagnose a difficult birthing experience. This condition may occur as a result of maternal or fetal factors, and can occur during any stage of the labor. Abnormalities of presentation, posture, and the position of the fetus within the uterus can negatively affect the temporal relationship between the birthing offspring and the maternal birth canal.
"
"Uterine inertia (inactivity) may be primary or secondary. Primary inertia is symptomized by a failure of the body to commence synchronous uterine contractions, and secondary inertia is symptomized by a cessation of uterine contractions due to uterine fatigue. This latter condition sometimes occurs when labor has gone on longer than the uterine muscles are capable of meeting the demands for.
"
"There are three stages of labor. The first stage of labor entails the start of uterine contractions, relaxation of the cervix, and rupture of the chorioallantoic sac (water breaking). The female dog (bitch) may be restless, nervous and occupy herself in nesting activity.
"
"The second stage of labor is when the fetuses are pushed out by uterine contractions. In dogs the average length of parturition (delivery), from the beginning of stage two to delivery of the first offspring is usually less than four hours. The time between deliveries of subsequent offspring is usually 20–60 minutes, but may be as long as 2–3 hours. It is important to consider this variability before intervening.
"
"The third stage is delivery of the fetal membranes. The female dog may alternate between stage two and three with multiple fetuses being delivered. She may deliver one or two fetuses followed by one or two fetal membranes, or she may deliver a fetus followed by its accompanying fetal membrane.
"
"Symptoms of dystocia:
"
"Fetal
"
"Maternal
"
"Predisposing Factors to Dystocia
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including any information you have about your dog's lineage, and details of any past pregnancies or reproductive problems. Your veterinarian will palpate (examine by touch) your dog's vaginal canal and cervix.
"
"Your veterinarian will take samples for testing; at the minimum, a packed cell volume (PCV), a total protein, a BUN (blood urea nitrogen), a blood glucose, and a calcium concentration measurement. Your dog's blood progesterone levels will also be measured.
"
"X-rays are crucial for determining the approximate number, size and location of the fetuses. X-rays may also show if the puppies are still alive, but an ultrasound can give even more subtle measurements, such as indications of fetal stress, assessing placental separation, and the character of the fetal fluids.
"
"
"
"Dogs that are in distress and have been diagnosed with dystocia should be treated on an inpatient basis until all of the offspring have been delivered and until the mother has stabilized. If uterine contractions are absent and there is no evidence of fetal stress, medical treatment will be initiated. Your dog's condition may be due to low blood sugar, low levels of blood calcium, inadequate oxytocin production by the body or an inadequate response to normal oxytocin production.
"
"Agents used to promote uterine contractions should not be administered when obstructive dystocia is possible, as they may accelerate placental separation and fetal death, or may cause uterine rupture. Oxytocin, glucose and calcium can be supplemented as needed.
"
"Manual delivery may be necessary to deliver a fetus that is lodged in the vaginal vault.
"
"Your veterinarian will use digital manipulation to reposition the puppy, since this method provides the least amount of damage to the puppy and bitch. If the vaginal vault is too small for digital manipulations, instruments, such as a spay hook or non-ratcheted forceps, may be used to assist in delivery. Throughout the process, your veterinarian will use adequate lubrication, always placing a finger in the vaginal vault to direct the instrument and always taking great care to protect the lives of both mother and puppies.
"
"Extreme caution should be used under these circumstances. Undesirable complications include mutilation of the fetus and laceration of the vaginal canal or uterus. Traction should never be applied to the limbs of a live fetus. If there is a failure to deliver the fetus within 30 minutes a Cesarean section is indicated.
"
"If your dog is a breed predisposed to dystocia, or if your dog has a personal or familial history of dystocia, ask your veterinarian about the possibility of scheduling an elective cesarean section before your dog can go into labor. It must be timed as precisely as possible to ensure the health of the mother and puppies. If you suspect early in labor that your dog is suffering from dystocia, contact your veterinarian immediately so as to prevent further complications in the lives of the mother and puppies.

"Bile, a bitter, high alkaline fluid that is secreted by the liver, serves important functions in the digestion and removal of waste materials from the body. Once bile has been formed in the liver, it is passed into the gallbladder, where it is held until food is digested. It is then released into the small intestine, both to aid in the digestion of food and to emulsify the food so that it can be used appropriately by the body, or carried out of the body as waste.
"
"Cholestasis is a term used to denote a condition in which obstruction of the bile duct prevents the normal flow of bile from the liver to the duodenum (a part of small intestine). Cholestasis can occur due to number of underlying diseases, including diseases of the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas.
"
"Miniature schnauzers and Shetland sheepdogs are predisposed to pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and are incidentally at higher risk for developing cholestasis. It is commonly seen in middle-aged and older dogs, but otherwise, this can be found in both male and female dogs.
"
"Symptoms will vary depending upon the underlying disease that is responsible for this condition. Following are several of the symptoms related to this disease:
"
"This problem can be associated with a number of diseases. Following are few of the causes that can lead to cholestasis:
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as trauma to the body. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms.
"
"Laboratory tests will include complete blood tests, a biochemistry panel, and urinalysis. These tests will reveal abnormalities related to the underlying disease, if there is one, as well as abnormalities that are due to the bile duct obstruction itself.
"
"Some patients show anemia and abnormalities related to the obstruction. The levels of waste products found in the blood will be indicative, like high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a throw-away component of the bile and blood fluids; a reddish colored pigment that detaches from the red blood cells as they degrade. Under normal circumstances, bilirubin is secreted through the bile and discarded from the body as waste, giving feces its characteristic color. Due to the bile duct obstruction, too much bilirubin can remain in the blood, eventually leading to a condition of jaundice. Typically, urinalyses will also show high concentrations of bilirubin in the urine and stool samples will be pale in color.
"
"Liver enzyme values may be elevated due to liver damage, and bleeding disorders are common with liver disease as well.
"
"Any blood that is taken will be evaluated through laboratory evaluations of your dog. Abdominal x-ray and ultrasound imaging can be used to examine the interior of the liver, pancreas, and gall bladder. In some cases, where laboratory testing and other techniques are not helpful for diagnosis, exploratory surgery may be used for diagnosis. Diagnostic surgery also carries the advantage of correcting the problem at the same time if it is found in the course of discovering the underlying issues.
"
"If your dog is found to be suffering from a form of neoplasia, an abnormal growth of tissue that is affecting the functioning ability of the bile duct, your veterinarian will need to determine whether the tissue is benign or cancerous. Further treatment will depend upon that outcome.
"
"  
"
"
"
"Treatment is highly variable and individual, depending upon the underlying cause and severity of the disease in your dog. If your dog is dehydrated it will be given fluid therapy along with supportive therapy. In cases with bleeding disorders owing to liver disease, the cause of the bleeding must be addressed before surgery can be performed. Parenteral (by injection) antibiotics will be administered pre-surgery to handle any infections that are present. Treatment approaches include medical treatment, surgery, or both.
"
"Bile duct obstruction, if not treated in time, can lead to serious complications, including severe damage to the gallbladder and liver. Follow your veterinarian's recommendations for treating and preventing a recurrence of this condition. Your dog will need special dietary restrictions while it recovers, which will be explained to you by your veterinarian. Recovery depends on treatment of the underlying cause of the obstruction, and on the bile duct being made viable for the normal outflow of bile contents. The prognosis is generally good, given that these issues are resolved.
"
"However, in case of neoplasia, overall prognosis for recovery is very poor.

"Bartonellosis, commonly known as cat scratch fever, is a bacterial infection that dogs and cats can get in their bloodstream. It is carried by fleas, ticks, lice, and sand flies. It can cause fever and inflammation of many organs in the body, including the heart. Bartonella spreads from these bugs and parasites.
"
"The infection has a higher prevalence in the South than in other areas of the United States. Worldwide, cats are found to be more commonly infected with the bacteria than dogs. However, dogs that are used for hunting and herding and live outside or in rural settings are more likely than indoor dogs to be exposed to parasites that carry bartonella.
"
"Dogs that are infected with Bartonella may show signs of:
"
"Fever
"
"Swollen lymph nodes
"
"Sore muscles; difficulty getting up or reluctance to run or jump
"
"Nose irritation such as discharge and/or nosebleeds
"
"Digestive upset (vomiting or diarrhea)
"
"Inflammation of the heart (coughing, difficulty breathing, or fainting)
"
"The bartonella infection is spread through bites from fleas, ticks, sand flies, and lice to their hosts. The host animal can then spread the infection to people if they scratch or bite a human, making it a zoonotic disease. This is known in humans as cat scratch fever (even though it is not always transmitted by a cat scratching a human’s skin). It is less common for a human to get infected with Bartonella from a dog, which could come from a bite.
"
"Basal cells are in the top layer of the skin, or epidermis. Basal cells make up the bottom layer of the epidermis and serve as a defensive mechanism, along with other types of cells.
"
"Basal cell tumors are one of the most common skin tumors in dogs and are almost always benign, or non-cancerous. When basal cell tumors are malignant, or cancerous, they are called basal cell carcinomas. Basal cell carcinomas can sometimes be mistaken for benign basal cell tumors.
"
"Basal cell tumors are most often found on a dog’s head, ears, neck, or front legs. These tumors are usually raised, dome-shaped, and firm, and can sometimes have a stalk, which allows them to stick out from the skin’s surface.
"
"Benign tumors often have a stalk while malignant tumors do not. They are sometimes dark in color.
"
"Basal cell tumors usually occur singularly and can be hairless and ulcerated.
"
"Basal cell tumors vary in size from 1 to 10 centimeters in diameter. Although these tumors are benign, they can grow quite large, break open, and cause tissue death and draining infections.
"
"There are six species of Bartonella known to infect dogs (B. henselae, B. vinsonii, B. clarridgeiae, B. elizabethae, B. washoensis, and B. quintana), but the most common is B. henselae, the strain that is responsible for cat scratch fever.
"
"Once a veterinarian performs a complete physical exam, they may recommend a complete blood count (CBC), chemistry profile, and urinalysis. They are checking for signs of infection and inflammation and the effects on the body’s organs.
"
"Blood testing is the best way to diagnose bartonellosis in a dog. These tests are sent to veterinary diagnostic labs.
"
"IFA (immunofluorescence antibodies) testing is useful for detecting exposure to Bartonella. Cultures can also be done on blood and affected tissues, like lymph nodes or even heart valves in the case of infections causing endocarditis, inflammation of the heart.  
"
"Endocarditis is best diagnosed via an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the heart.  Preliminary tests such as blood testing for general infection, an EKG, and chest X-rays can be done with your general veterinarian prior to referral for the echocardiogram if needed.
"
"The good news is that bartonellosis can be treated with antibiotics. A 4- to 6-week regimen of doxycycline, amoxicillin, or enrofloxacin has been shown to be effective in treating the infection. Because of the long course of treatment with antibiotics and the desire to prevent antibiotic resistance, treatment is primarily recommended for symptomatic animals only.
"
"Symptoms of bartonellosis in dogs usually resolve after 2-4 weeks of treatment. Mild swelling of the glands and generalized fatigue could continue for months, though this is uncommon.
"
"
There are no vaccines to prevent bartonellosis. Good flea and tick prevention, which can be recommended by your veterinarian, is important in preventing this disease. It is also important to monitor your dog when they are in areas where these bugs are native or prevalent, and removing any visible fleas or ticks is always a good preventive measure.
"
"Humans who are immunocompromised should avoid rough play or being bit by dogs at risk for being infected with bartonella. Puppies, who have sharp teeth and can do more nipping and biting, can be a source of infection, especially to immunocompromised people. There is no documentation that humans can be infected directly via a tick or flea. 
"
"Bartonellosis is rarely fatal in dogs. The most severe cases are those that cause severe inflammation of the heart.
"
"It cannot be completely cured, but it can be brought down to subclinical levels. It is recommended to treat infected dogs with antibiotics, especially if they live in households with immunocompromised humans. The likelihood of transmission of the bacteria from subclinical carriers of the bartonella bacteria is unknown, but a lower risk to humans is presumed if the dog is subclinical.

"Ulceration and bleeding from the tumor
"
"Darkened skin around the tumor
"
"Pus or fluid draining from the skin growth
"
"Basal cell tumors develop when basal cells or other skin cells, such as those from the sweat glands, hair follicles, or sebaceous glands, divide uncontrollably and cause an abnormal growth or mass.
"
"While experts don’t understand exactly why skin tumors develop, some factors can increase a dog’s risk. Environmental effects, such as the sun, as well as genetics may play a role in the development of basal cell tumors in dogs.
"
"Dog breeds that are predisposed to basal cell tumors include:
"
"Shelties
"
"Siberian Huskies
"
"Wirehaired Pointing Griffons
"
"Kerry Blue Terriers
"
"Wheaten Terriers
"
"Basal cell tumors commonly occur in middle-aged and older dogs. Malignant basal cell carcinomas are more common in older Standard Poodles and Cocker Spaniels.
"
"Basal cell tumors are diagnosed with cytology or a biopsy (i.e., histopathology). Fine needle aspiration (FNA), which involves collecting tumor cells for cytology using a needle and syringe, can be performed during a routine office visit without sedation.
"
"The sample is then placed on a glass slide and examined under a microscope to identify the main cell type of the tumor, which can provide a diagnosis.
"
"If your vet can’t get a diagnosis with cytology, or the tumor is large and needs to be surgically removed, a biopsy can be taken.
"
"Biopsy involves surgically removing a small piece of the tumor and sending it to a veterinary pathologist for evaluation. A biopsy will determine the tumor type and whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
"
"Biopsies require heavy sedation or general anesthesia, depending on the tumor’s extent and how long your vet thinks the procedure will take.
"
"Prior to general anesthesia or sedation, your veterinarian will likely recommend pre-surgical blood work and chest X-rays to ensure your dog is healthy enough to undergo sedation or anesthesia.
"
"Treatment options for basal cell tumors depend on the size and location of the tumor.
"
"Surgical removal as soon as possible is often the best course of treatment to prevent the tumor from rupturing and causing skin death and secondary infection.

"
"If your dog has a secondary infection, they should receive oral medications (antibiotics) before and after the surgical procedure.
"
"Although basal cell tumors grow slowly, larger tumors can be difficult to remove, especially if they are located on the head or leg, where there is little excess skin to close a surgical wound.
"
"If the tumor is small and not bothersome, you can choose to monitor it for any progress that indicates the need for surgery.
"
"Basal cell carcinomas should be surgically removed as soon as possible, regardless of their size and location, to prevent spread and other negative effects. In addition to surgery, malignant basal cell carcinoma treatment may include radiation and/or chemotherapy.
"
"Specialty veterinary hospitals may offer cryosurgery, which uses low temperatures to freeze off the tumor.
"
"Mass removal surgery includes removal of some normal tissue around the tumor as well. Once the tumor is removed (even if a biopsy was sent for evaluation before surgery) the entire mass should be sent to a veterinary pathologist. This is to ensure the entire tumor has been removed.
"
"With complete excision, your dog is considered cured and their prognosis for a full recovery is excellent.
"
"After surgery, your dog may have stitches or staples in their skin to close the incision. Your dog should wear a protective collar or cone collar after surgery to prevent them from harming the incision site, even if there are no visible stitches.
"
"Pain and/or anti-inflammatory medications are often used after surgery to ensure your dog is comfortable during recovery. If a tumor is removed from your dog’s leg, your pup may require strict exercise restriction to prevent tension on the incision that could cause it to reopen or become infected.
"
"It’s important to monitor the incision to ensure it doesn’t develop an infection. If you notice any redness, swelling, or discharge, or if the incision opens at any time, your dog should be evaluated by their veterinarian immediately.
"
"Skin tumor removal typically requires a two-week recovery period, after which your dog will need a postoperative recheck by their vet to ensure they can return to normal activity.
"
"Since the cause of basal cell tumors is unknown, there is no way to prevent them from occurring.
"
"If your pup is of a predisposed dog breed, monitor their skin for abnormalities and have any changes evaluated by your veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"The cost of veterinary care and surgery is highly variable depending on what type of animal hospital you go to and your location. In general, your regular veterinarian’s office is usually less expensive than an emergency hospital or specialty surgeon.
"
"Basal cell tumor removal surgery can cost anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on the tumor’s size and location and who performs the surgery.
"
"Since most basal cell tumors are benign and can be completely removed, the survival rate is excellent, and the tumor should not affect your dog’s life expectancy.

"Tyzzer disease is a bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Clostridium pilformis. The bacterium is thought to multiply in the intestines and once reaching the liver, causing severe damage. Young dogs are at high risk of developing the disease.
"
"Due to the severity of the liver damage, some dogs with Tyzzer disease may die within 24-48 hours. Some early signs of the disease include:
"
"The bacterium Clostridium piliformis.
"
"Your veterinarian will conduct a complete medical history and perform a physical examination on your dog. He or she will then use routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to assess the condition of your dog and severity of the disease.
"
"If your dog has Tyzzer disease, the biochemistry profile testing may reveal abnormally high levels of liver enzymes, especially shortly before the dog's condition becomes dire.
"
"
"
"Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for Tyzzer disease. Consult with your veterinarian if there is anything that can be done to alleviate your dog's pain.

"Tularemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease that is occasionally seen in dogs. It is associated with multiple animal species, including humans, and can be acquired from through contact with infected animals. Also commonly know as rabbit fever for its mode of transmission, even while it can infect several types of animals and be transmitted via any infected animal, as such, the bacteria can also be acquired by ingestion of contaminated water, or through contact with infected soil, where the organism can remain in an infectious state for up to several months.
"
"Infection is often caused by ingestion of an infected mammals' tissue, such as when a dog hunts a small animal, bird or reptile, through water, or by tick, mite, flea or mosquito bite -- all of which can carry and transmit the bacteria. The bacterium may also infect a dog through its skin, or by entering its airways, eyes or gastrointestinal system.
"
"Tularemia is found throughout much of the world, including continental Europe, Japan and China, and in the Soviet Union. In the United States, it is most common in Arkansas and Missouri, though it can be found in most parts of the U.S. It also tends to have higher seasonal incidence, with May through August being a time of increased risk. An increase is also seen during the winter rabbit hunting season, in areas where this is a common practice.
"
"One of the most common vectors of communication of the F. tularensis bacterium is the tick, which includes the American dog tick, the Lone Star tick, and the Rocky Mountain wood tick, along with other types of ticks.
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health and recent activities, including a recent history of boardings, outings, trips, tick bites, and experiences with other animals or with pests.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog. Standard laboratory work will include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. If F. tularensis is present, the results of the complete blood count may show a responsive increase in white blood cells (WBCs), but this is not always the case. Tests may also show lower than normal levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia), the cells that help in blood clotting.
"
"The biochemistry profile may reveal abnormally high levels of bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia) and lower than normal levels of sodium and glucose in the blood. If the blood tests reveal high levels of bilirubin, the orange-yellow pigment found in the bile, this can indicate that liver damage is occurring. This condition is commonly characterized by symptoms of jaundice. The urinalysis may also reveal high levels of bilirubin and blood in the urine.
"
"Your veterinarian may need the assistance of a specialized laboratory service for confirmatory diagnosis. In some cases the diagnosis is not so obvious and samples will need to be taken to be sent for culture testing - controlled growth in a lab environment in order to define the causative organism.
"
"Molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method which distinguishes the presence of disease based on its genetic code, are available in reference laboratories. The microbiologist must be informed when tularemia is suspected because F. tularensis requires special media for cultivation, such as buffered charcoal and yeast extract (BCYE). It cannot be isolated in the routine culture media because of the need for sulfhydryl group donors (such as cystein). Serological tests (detection of antibodies in the serum of the patients) are available and widely used. Cross reactivity with brucella can confuse interpretation of the results, and for this reason diagnosis should not rely only on serology.
"
"
"
"Early treatment is the mainstay of successful resolution and cure of the symptoms. A high rate of deaths is common in patients that are not treated early. Your veterinarian will prescribe antibiotics to control the infection and its related symptoms. Your dog may need antibiotic therapy for several days for a complete resolution of the symptoms.
"
"The overall prognosis is poor, especially in animals that are not treated early on in the course of the disease.
"
"As previously mentioned, F. tularensis is a zoonotic infection, meaning that it can be passed form one species to another. If your dog is infected with this bacteria you will need to take special precautions to protect yourself from infection. The bacteria most often penetrates the body through damaged skin and mucous membranes, or through inhalation. Humans are most likely to acquire the infection by tick bite, and in some cases, simply through handling an infected animal. Tularemia can also be acquired by inhalation. In some cases, it is known to have occurred during the grooming process with dogs, and hunters are at a higher risk for this disease because of the potential of inhaling the bacteria during the skinning process. Ingesting the infected water, soil, or food that has become contaminated can also cause infection. In some other cases, it has been contracted from inhaling particles from an infected rabbit or other small rodent that was ground up in a lawnmower.
"
"F. tularensis is an intracellular bacterium, meaning that it is able to live parasitically within the host cells. It primarily infects macrophages, a type of white blood cell, thus evading the immune system's response to destroy it. The course of the disease is dependent on the organism's ability to spread to multiple organ systems, including the lungs, liver, spleen, and lymphatic system.

"Nocardiosis is an uncommon infectious disease affecting several body systems, including the respiratory, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems. Both dogs and cats may become exposed to the infectious, saphrophytic organism, which nourishes itself from dead or decaying matter in the soil. Typically, the exposure occurs either through open wounds or via inhalation.
"
"Symptoms of nocardiosis are largely dependent on the site of infection. If, for example, it occurs in the pleural body cavity, which includes the lungs and surrounding membranes, symptoms can include emaciation, fever, and raspy, labored breathing (dyspnea). If it is a skin infection, symptoms can include the presence of chronic non-healing wounds and, if left untreated, draining lymph nodes. If the infection is not localized in one specific area of the body, the symptoms may include fever, weight loss, and lethargic behavior. Also known as disseminated nocardiosis, this form of nocardiosis is most common in young dogs.
"
"The infectious organism is found in the soil and can enter the dog's body through open wounds or through the respiratory tract, when it inhales. Nocardia asteroides is the most common species affecting dogs. However, they may also be susceptible to Proactinomyces spp., but it is very rare.
"
"In addition, dogs with compromised immune systems or those suffering from autoimmune diseases increases the likelihood of this type of Nocardia infection.
"
"Your veterinarian will analyze cells from the dog's thorax or abdomen to identify the causative organism. Other diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays and urine analysis, are employed to rule out other potential causes, including fungal infections and tumors.
"
"
"
"Treatment for nocardiosis is largely dependent upon the site of infection and subsequent symptoms. If pleural effusion is apparent, hospitalization will be necessary to prevent dehydration. Surgical drainage of the fluid may even be required. Otherwise, long-term antibiotic therapy is vital for fighting off the infection.
"
"Because nocardiosis frequently affects the musculoskeletal and central nervous system, it is imperative that you carefully monitor the dog for fever, weight loss, seizures, breathing difficulties, and lameness for at least one year after therapy.
"
"General cleanliness and frequent disinfection of your dog's wounds or cuts may help prevent this type of infection, especially if your dog has a weakened immune system.

"Streptococci are bacteria that can cause infections in both humans and animals. Streptococcus canis is the streptococcal species most commonly found in dogs. The bacterium is normally present in a healthy dog’s throat, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, reproductive tract, and skin.
"
"In some cases, streptococci can breach a dog’s normal defenses, invading tissues and leading to various disease manifestations. This can result in skin and ear infections, pharyngitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and arthritis.
"
"In severe cases, the infection can progress to potentially life-threatening conditions, including necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).
"
"Since S. canis normally colonizes in a dog’s body, infection is common, but it usually only occurs when the dog has a wound or suppressed immune system. Most affected pups experience only mild to moderate symptoms associated with the infection.
"
"Streptococcus can affect many areas of a dog’s body. Depending on the body area the pathogen infects, symptoms of S. canis can include:
"
"Fever
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Coughing
"
"Redness and pain at wound site
"
"Discharge and odor at wound site
"
"Ear pain, discharge, and odor
"
"Pain when urinating
"
"Stiffness, especially after resting
"
"Some pet parents worry about passing their strep throat infection to their canine companion, but the Infectious Disease Society of America explains that the streptococcus bacterium causing strep throat in humans is different from the one that affects dogs.
"
"Currently, there’s no scientific evidence that suggests the organism that causes strep throat in humans can infect dogs. A dog’s predisposition to developing a streptococcus infection depends on the following:
"
"Age—Puppies’ immune systems are not fully developed, and senior dogs commonly experience a weakening of their immune systems. This decreases a dog’s ability to fight infection, making them more at risk of streptococcus infection.
"
"Wounds—S. canis is typically present on the skin and can infect open wounds. If your dog chews or licks a wound, they won’t usually develop an S. canis infection. However, you shouldn’t allow your dog to chew or lick a wound. This can lead to other types of infection.
"
"Immunosuppression—Dogs with a weakened immune system, such as those undergoing chemotherapy or experiencing underlying health conditions, have a higher risk of infection than healthy dogs.
"
"Allergies—Dogs with atopy (a chronic allergic skin reaction) or other allergic skin conditions face an increased risk of infection because their skin barrier is compromised.
"
"Severe S. canis–related disease can occur, although these cases are rare. Potential S. canis complications include:
"
"Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)—STSS is a streptococcal infection that triggers sudden shock, organ failure, and bleeding abnormalities throughout a dog’s body.
"
"Symptoms of STSS include fever, vomiting, unexplained bruising, bleeding from the nose or rectum, and collapse. Death from STSS can occur in as little as 48 hours.
"
"Necrotizing fasciitis (NF)—NF is a streptococcal infection that invades the deep skin layers, causing tissue death.
"
"NF often starts as a minor wound and can progress to tissue death in 24 to 72 hours. Lesions usually involve the limbs, and symptoms include localized heat, swelling, and wound discharge.
"
"Most S. canis cases are not considered an emergency, but you should schedule an appointment with your vet or an urgent care facility as soon as you notice symptoms in your pup.
"
"Some symptoms of streptococcus can be the cause of an emergency. Take your pup to the vet immediately if they experience any of the following:
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Significant heat, swelling, or pain associated with a wound
"
"Unexplained bruising or bleeding
"
"A fever higher than 105 degrees Fahrenheit
"
"If your dog shows signs of bacterial infection, your veterinarian may perform one or more of these diagnostic tests:
"
"History—Your vet will ask you to describe your dog’s symptoms, as well as when you first noticed them. Tell your vet about any underlying health conditions your dog may have.
"
"Physical exam—Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam.
"
"Bloodwork—By performing blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and a biochemistry profile, your vet can assess your dog’s overall health, helping them determine whether your pup has an infection.
"
"Urinalysis—Your vet may recommend a urinalysis, especially if they suspect your dog has a UTI.
"
"Swab—If your dog has a skin or ear infection, your vet will likely take a sample from the problematic area to perform a culture and cytology. This test helps your veterinarian identify the cause of a skin or ear infection, so they can prescribe an appropriate antibiotic for your dog.
"
"Skin scrape—In some cases, your veterinarian may perform a skin scrape or biopsy to help identify the infectious organism or to rule out other skin conditions.
"
"Treatment for streptococcus in dogs depends upon where the infection is located on the body, and how severe it is.
"
"Potential treatments include:
"
"Fluid therapy—If your dog is dehydrated, your vet may hospitalize them to administer intravenous (IV) fluids.
"
"Antibiotics—S. canis is usually vulnerable to antibiotics, and your vet will choose an appropriate medication.
"
"Tissue removal—If your dog has an infected wound, your vet may need to remove dead tissue to help the area heal.
"
"Bandaging—To protect the infected area and prevent your dog from licking it, your veterinarian may bandage the wound.
"
"Ear wash—If your dog has a streptococcal ear infection, your veterinarian will likely recommend ear cleaning in addition to ear medications.
"
"Most uncomplicated streptococcal ear, respiratory, and urinary tract infections resolve in five to seven days after your dog receives the appropriate antibiotics.
"
"While your dog recovers, ensure they stay hydrated and get as much rest as possible. For a dog whose wound has developed a streptococcal infection, recovery depends on the infection severity and may take several weeks or months.
"
"Most streptococcus infections in dogs are unpreventable.
"
"However, you can lower your dog’s risk of infection by scheduling your pup’s regular wellness visits, so your vet can detect underlying health issues in their early stages.
"
"If your dog has wounds or even minor injuries, be sure to monitor them for signs such as heat, swelling, excessive pain, and discharge.
"
"Seek veterinary care immediately if these signs occur.
"
"S. canis is contagious and can pass from one dog to another.
"
"However, a dog typically doesn’t develop an infection unless their immune system has been compromised. Dogs rarely pass this infection to humans, but you should still practice good hygiene—especially frequent hand washing—when your dog is sick.

"Mycoplasmosis is the general medical name given to a disease caused by any one of three infectious agents: mycoplasma, t-mycoplasma or ureaplasma, and acholeplasma. Each of these agents is an anaerobic bacterial parasitic microorganism. They are capable of living and growing even without the presence of oxygen (anaerobic), and are able to self produce.
"
"Mycoplasma lack a true cell wall, making them capable of assuming a variety of shapes, and capable of spreading into different systems throughout the body, from the respiratory tract, where they can cause pneumonia, to the urinary tract, where they can result in various forms of diseased conditions. These bacteria are believed to be the smallest organisms capable of growing independently, and they remain ubiquitous in nature; they are found in nearly every environment, causing disease not only in animals, but also in people, plants, and insects.
"
"Symptoms of mycoplasmosis includes simultaneous inflammation of several joints (known as polyarthritis), such as the knees, ankles, hips, or shoulders. Long-term lameness, difficulty moving, fever, and general signs of discomfort are some of the typical signs. Other signs may include squinting or spasmodic blinking, fluid-buildup in the eyes, reddened eyes, discharge from the eyes, or conjunctivitis, a condition in which the moist tissue of the eye becomes inflamed. Respiratory symptoms are usually mild, with sneezing being the main complaint.
"
"In dogs, further signs related to the site of infection may include infections in the respiratory system, or urinary and genital tract infections. Urethritis, vaginitis, prostatitis, nephritis, and cystitis are some of the conditions that may be present. Because of the genital to reproductive system proximity of this bacterial parasite, infertility is a common finding, along with pregnancies that abort or produce weak newborns, result in stillbirth, early death of newborns, or death while in embryo.
"
"Mycoplasmosis is caused by exposure to a number of commonplace bacteria that can be found throughout the environment. Some types of bacteria that lead to mycoplasmosis in dogs include M. canis, M. spumans, and M. maculosum.
"
"Factors that may increase the risk of developing mycoplasmosis include an immunodeficiency disorder that prevents the immune system from functioning properly, as well as other issues that may affect the immune system, such as tumors.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will also be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.
"
"There are various diagnostic procedures that may be undertaken if the symptoms of mycoplasmosis are present. An analysis of the fluid secreted into the prostate can reveal if normal bacterial cultures are present. The presence of mycoplasmosis will be concurrent with inflammatory cells. If polyarthritis is suspected, an analysis of the synovial fluid, the fluid found in the cavities of certain joints (e.g., knees, shoulders), may be useful. Increased levels of nondegenerative neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, are usually found in this case.
"
"
"
"Mycoplasmosis is treated on an outpatient basis, meaning it does not require hospitalization and can be treated at home. Depending on the severity and localization of the condition, antibiotics may be prescribed in order to address the infection.
"
"Treatment at home generally must continue for an extended period of time. Your veterinarian can specifically prescribe the appropriate antibiotic treatment and specify the necessary length of treatment based on an examination of the symptoms. It is important to regularly administer any antibiotic treatment for the full period of time as advised by your veterinarian.
"
"Animals with healthy immune systems that are given proper treatment with antibiotics have a good prognosis and are expected to recover fully.
"
"There are no known vaccines available to prevent infection by the bacteria which cause mycoplasmosis, thus there is little that can be done to prevent infection. The bacteria causing mycoplasmosis may be killed by drying out (for example, via sunshine) as well as chemical disinfection. Your veterinarian can guide you in the selection of products that will work in your environment. General cleanliness and avoidance of extended exposure to moisture may be helpful.

"An autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system, responsible for protecting against foreign invaders, mistakenly targets its own body’s proteins and cells instead of external threats.
"
"This immune response creates immune complexes that can harm tissues and organs, leading to various symptoms. 
"
"While not typically an immediate emergency, untreated autoimmune diseases can have serious consequences that can be fatal. 
"
"Autoimmune diseases can manifest in various ways, affecting different parts of a dog’s body. Some common types include:
"
"Pemphigus foliaceus: Targets skin cells, causing cracks, fissures, pustules, scaling, and infection
"
"Pemphigus erythematosus: Affects skin on the face, particularly in certain breeds like German Shepherds, Collies, and Shetland Sheepdogs
"
"Pemphigus vulgaris: Rare and severe; can lead to skin lesions, including erosions and vesicles, affecting various parts of the body, including the lips, nose, nailbeds, and other skin areas
"
"Bullous pemphigoid: Separates the top and middle layers of the skin
"
"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): Affects multiple systems, creating symptoms including lameness, skin lesions, anemia, kidney failure, and seizures
"
"Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE): A benign form of lupus that affects the skin of only the nose and face
"
"Myasthenia gravis: Impairs neuromuscular junctions, leading to muscle weakness that can manifest as difficulty eating or swallowing, regurgitation, and generalized limb weakness that often is worsened with exercise
"
"Granulomatous Meningoencephalitis (GME): Inflammation that typically affects the blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord, causing seizures, blindness, circling, and abnormal gait
"
"Masticatory myositis: Targets muscles used for chewing; typically affects large-breed dogs and leads to painful and swollen muscles, a reluctance to eat, difficulty swallowing, and eventual weight loss
"
"Glomerulonephritis: Impacts kidney function, and includes symptoms associated with kidney failure, such as an increased thirst and urination, muscle wasting, lack of appetite, and swelling of the limbs and abdomen
"
"Polyarthritis: Causes joint inflammation, triggering lameness and arthritis
"
"Uveodermatologic syndrome (Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like Syndrome): Targets melanin pigment and frequently results in blindness, affecting breeds such as the Akita, Old English Sheepdog, Golden Retriever, Husky, and Irish Setter
"
"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS): Commonly referred to as “dry eye”; occurs in about 1% of the canine population, and more so in Shih Tzus, Cocker Spaniels, Boston Terriers, and Pekingese
"
"Pannus (chronic immune-mediated superficial keratitis): A progressive, non-curable disease that damages the cornea and leads to blindness
"
"Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia (ITP): Affects platelets, the cells responsible for blood clotting, leading to extensive bruising and potentially hemorrhage
"
"Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia (IMHA): Impairs the red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the tissues, resulting in weakness, pale gums, difficulty breathing, and/or collapse
"
"While IMHA, ITP, and pemphigus foliaceus occur in dogs more commonly than other autoimmune diseases, overall, autoimmune disease is uncommon in dogs.
"
"Dogs suffering from an autoimmune disease will experience symptoms associated with the organs or cell functions targeted by the immune system.
"
"Some symptoms can occur sporadically, worsening over time, and some can occur suddenly.
"
"Though not an exhaustive list, depending on the area under attack by the immune system, dogs commonly will show symptoms including:
"
"Anemia (low red blood cell count)
"
"Blood in the urine or stool
"
"Bruising and pinpoint hemorrhages seen on the gums or skin (petechiae)
"
"Collapse
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Depigmentation of the skin and nose
"
"Difficulty breathing or an increased respiratory rate
"
"Difficulty eating
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes
"
"Erythema (redness) of the skin
"
"Fever
"
"Hair loss
"
"Increased heart rate
"
"Kidney failure
"
"Lameness
"
"Lethargy
"
"Mouth ulcers and bad breath
"
"Muscle atrophy
"
"Pale gums
"
"Painful or stiff muscles and joints
"
"Scaling, redness, crusting, and skin ulcerations
"
"Seizures
"
"Sneezing, often with blood (epistaxis)
"
"Swelling of the limbs or abdomen
"
"Vomiting
"
"Autoimmune diseases can affect any breed, but they are more frequently observed in unspayed females.
"
"Contributing factors include genetics (with a higher occurrence in purebreds), cancer, or environmental influences like UV light, infections, medications, or other medical therapies.
"
"Dogs diagnosed with one autoimmune disease are more likely to develop other immune-mediated diseases.
"
" 
"
"Diagnosing autoimmune diseases can be challenging.
"
"Such a diagnosis is often made through a process of exclusion, which means that other possible causes are ruled out and the true underlying cause remains unknown.
"
"Veterinarians typically use blood work, urine tests, and other screenings to identify potential issues. In some cases, a biopsy or advanced imaging such as a CT scan or MRI may be necessary.
"
"While not all tests are 100% confirmatory, when analyzed together with the symptoms, there can be sufficient information to make an immune-mediated diagnosis. 
"
"Because autoimmune diseases occur due to an over-reactive and inappropriate immune system, treatment aims at suppressing the immune system.
"
"This is often approached using prescription medications called immunosuppressants.
"
"Steroids at high doses are the most prescribed drug and the most effective, though they have adverse side effects.
"
"To minimize or avoid these side effects, other immunosuppressive drugs may be used in conjunction with steroids.
"
"Because certain drug combinations appear to work better for specific conditions and have a variable response in the individual, be sure to partner with your veterinarian for the best therapy options for your dog. 
"
"Because many dogs suffering from the negative effects of autoimmune disease experience pain or discomfort and poor quality of life, pain medications will often be prescribed.
"
"Many dogs with autoimmune disease also have secondary infections, and antibiotics may be needed. 
"
"Additionally, topical therapies such as ointments, shampoos, or conditioners are often prescribed in conjunction with oral medications as an effective way to target localized lesions and decrease the dose of oral medications.
"
"Affected dogs typically don’t require a change of diet or supplements, but some dogs with long-lasting kidney issues or glomerulonephritis can benefit from prescription diets such as Royal Canin Renal.
"
"Dogs affected by IMHA or ITP may require supplementation with iron or vitamins.
"
"In the acute hospital setting, dogs may require:
"
"Blood transfusions
"
"IV fluids
"
"A feeding tube
"
"Medication to prevent seizures
"
"Anticoagulants to help prevent blood clots
"
"Anti-nausea and antiemetic medications to prevent vomiting
"
"Oxygen therapy
"
"Therapeutic abdominocentesis, where fluid is drained from the abdomen
"
"Thoracocentesis, where fluid is drained from the body.
"
"Autoimmune diseases vary in prognosis.
"
"For example, dogs with DLE typically show improvement within eight to twelve weeks.
"
"However, those with myasthenia gravis have about a 33% chance of improving, going into remission, or not surviving. Complications from the disease and the treatment itself can lead to the humane euthanasia of many dogs. 
"
"While autoimmune diseases are not curable, they can be managed with lifelong medications.
"
"It may take months to see significant improvement.
"
"Once symptoms are resolved, your veterinarian may recommend tapering drug therapy to the lowest effective dose to manage symptoms while minimizing side effects.
"
"Relapses can occur, but tapering drugs benefits your dog in the long run.
"
"Regular follow-up and monitoring are vital to prevent relapse and assess drug side effects. Always adhere to your vet’s recommendations and consult them before discontinuing or self-tapering medications.
"
"Unfortunately, most autoimmune diseases cannot be prevented, but a prompt diagnosis followed by immediate treatment can be lifesaving.
"
"Be sure to have your dog examined by their vet at the first sign of a problem.
"
"Be sure to follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for recheck examinations to minimize relapses.
"
"Additionally, make sure that all veterinary providers are aware of your dog’s condition and what medications they are taking.
"
"Certain medications and vaccines have the potential to exacerbate the condition or cause recurrence of the disease.
"
"Since suppressing the immune system can increase the risk of developing other infections like urinary tract infections, regular screening and monitoring for potential infections are essential for your dog’s long-term health.
"
"UV light can also exacerbate certain diseases, so try to limit sun exposure by walking your dog in the early morning or late evening and use a pet-approved sunscreen on the bridge of the nose and non-haired skin when necessary.
"
"Life expectancy varies based on disease remission, recurrence, and underlying co-morbidities. 
"
"Humane euthanasia may be necessary for dogs with extensive clinical signs, multi-organ involvement, poor quality of life, unresponsiveness to treatment, or suffering from treatment side effects.
"
"Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases in dogs.
"
"It occurs when the immune system targets the body’s platelets, leading to widespread hemorrhage and bruising.
"
"Autoimmune diseases commonly occur without a known cause.
"
"However, several factors underlie most immune-mediated diseases, including genetics, infection, cancer, drugs, and environmental influences.

"Campylobacteriosis is a bacterial infection prevalent in puppies younger than six months old. The bacteria which causes the disease can even be found in the gut (gastrointestinal tract) of healthy dogs and other mammals.
"
"Up to 49 percent of dogs carry campylobacteriosis, shedding it into their feces for other animals to contract. Because of this, humans can contract the disease if they do not practice proper hygiene after coming into contact with an infected animal.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"There are several known causes of the disease, but the most common is from kennels which allow animals to come into direct contact with contaminated feces. Ingestion of contaminated food or water is another mode of transmission. Younger animals are at a greater risk for contracting the disease because of their underdeveloped immune systems.
"
"A fecal culture is the most common diagnostic procedure. After 48 hours, veterinarians will examine the culture to look for leukocytes (fecal white blood cells) in the stool; leukocytes may also be found in the animal's gastrointestinal tract. Other diagnostic procedures include urine and blood tests.
"

"Babesiosis is caused by infection with Babesia, a protozoal parasite. It is found across the world in domestic dogs and cats. In North America, most cases of babesiosis in dogs occur in the Southern United States. The disease is considered uncommon in healthy, spleen-intact adult dogs, but is considered an emerging infection in dogs.
"
"Babesia attacks red blood cells in the body. Infection is spread through tick bites and/or exposure to infected dog blood. Dogs with babesiosis, even those without any clinical signs, can spread infection to other dogs, most commonly in kennels.
"
"Veterinarians often diagnose babesiosis incidentally after owners bring their dogs to be examined due to sudden illness.  Because babesiosis is a tick-borne infection, it is not uncommon for infected dogs to have other tick-borne infections, such as ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, and others. These infections may interact with each other, making the condition more severe.
"
"The most common mode of transmission of Babesia in dogs is by a tick bite. The Ornate dog tick, the Brown dog tick, and the American dog tick, among other tick species, have been implicated in transmitting Babesia to dogs. The tick must bite, attach, and feed on a blood meal from the dog for 2 to 3 days.
"
"Several disease-causing species of Babesia have been identified as causing infection in dogs, including Babesia canis (subspecies vogeli, canis, rossi), Babesia gibsoni (most prominent in the US), Babesia vulpes, and Babesia conradae. Babesia gibsoni is believed to transmit disease in dogs directly through infected blood from dog fights and bites or blood transfusions. It may even spread into a puppy’s bloodstream from an infected mother dog (transplacental transmission).
"
"The incubation period, or time from tick bite to when symptoms start, averages about two weeks, but symptoms may remain mild. Some cases are not diagnosed for months or even years.
"
"Babesia organisms are usually classified as large or small:
"
"Babesia canis is a large blood parasite that infects dogs, and it is distributed worldwide
"
"There is also a genetically distinct small blood parasite that can infect dogs.
"
"For mild cases, outpatient treatment is generally recommended. Meanwhile, dogs with a severe case of campylobacteriosis require close monitoring to prevent further complications. Your veterinarian may also recommend isolating the animal, administering an oral fluid therapy treatment for its dehydration, as well as dog antibiotics or a plasma transfusion.
"
"While the dog is under treatment, it is important to keep it hydrated and watch for any worsening signs. Also, take the dog in for its follow-up treatments to ensure the bacteria have been completely removed.
"
"Practicing overall proper hygiene by cleaning your dog's living and eating area, and routinely disinfecting its water and food bowls, are good ways to prevent this type of bacterial infection.

"Babesia gibsoni—worldwide distribution; emerging disease in the US. Mostly attacks Pit Bull Terriers and is transmitted by bite wound and from mother to unborn puppies. This is the most common Babesia in North America.
"
"Specific breeds, such as Greyhounds and members of the Terrier group, have an increased risk of infection. Babesiosis is considered a serious threat to racing Greyhounds and Pit Bull Terriers. Young dogs tend to be most severely infected.
"
"Signs of infection vary from a mild illness that passes quickly to a severe disease that rapidly results in death. Signs can be highly variable, depending on the area of the body that is infected. Common clinical signs include:
"
"Lack of energy, lethargy, depression
"
"Lack of appetite
"
"Pale gums and other mucous membranes
"
"Fever
"
"Enlarged lymph nodes or spleen
"
"Abnormally dark-colored urine, usually dark red or orange
"
"Yellow or orange skin, jaundice
"
"Enlarged or swollen abdomen
"
"Weight loss
"
"Discolored stool
"
"Neurologic signs, including
"
"Imbalance and/or wobbly gait
"
"Seizures
"
"Neck pain
"
"Ticks are typically found near a dog’s neck, head, and ears, and in the creases under the legs.
"
"Ticks are generally tiny and feel like a hard bump on your dog’s skin. They are typically dark brown or black. Depending on the life stage, ticks will have six legs (larvae) or eight legs (nymphs and adults). If they have been on your dog for a while, they might be engorged from feeding on your dog’s blood and appear to be a light brown or gray color. Dogs can still get ticks even if they are up to date on monthly flea and tick preventatives. It’s best to check your dog often if you live in an area where ticks are prevalent, and after spending time in wooded areas and parks with other dogs.
"
"Once a tick bites a dog, blood-borne parasites such as Babesia enter the bloodstream. A tick must feed for 2-3 days to infect a dog with Babesia. It replicates in red blood cells, resulting in anemia. The infected red blood cells are broken down and hemoglobin is released into the body. This can lead to jaundice (yellow discoloration of skin and whites of the eyes) and to anemia when the body cannot produce enough new red blood cells to replace those being destroyed.
"
"Dogs that spend a lot of time outdoors, especially in wooded areas, are at an increased risk for tick bites and for contracting this parasite.
"
"There is evidence of direct dog-to-dog transmission of Babesia under certain circumstances, including:
"
"An infected dog with oral lesions or abrasions bites another dog. This is particularly true for Babesia gibsoni, which primarily affects Pit Bull Terriers.
"
"An unborn puppy is infected in the uterus of the mother.
"
"A dog is unintentionally infected through a contaminated blood transfusion from another dog.
"
"When dogs are housed in kennel settings with poor tick control.
"
"Your veterinarian will obtain a full history of symptoms, including when a tick bite might have occurred or a dog fight. The vet will do a complete physical examination including:
"
"Complete blood count
"
"Blood biochemical profile
"
"Urinalysis
"
"Electrolyte panel
"
"Low blood protein levels, a decreased number of blood platelets, and anemia are often noted.
"
"Babesiosis can be confused with other illnesses that cause fever, anemia, destruction of red blood cells, jaundice, or red urine. One or more of the following laboratory tests should be performed to confirm the diagnosis:
"
"Wright’s stain, a stain used on a dog’s blood sample and then examined by microscope, helps your veterinarian differentiate blood cells, making an infection of the blood more apparent as it allows for the protozoa to be seen on the blood smear.
"
"Immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) tests look for antibodies in the serum of the blood that react with the Babesia organism. The serum is the part of the blood left behind when all of the cells are removed by high-speed spinning of a blood sample. IFA tests are limited because they cannot usually distinguish between different species and subspecies of Babesia.
"
"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is another blood test. A positive test result is dependent on an antibody response by the infected dog, which may take up to 10 days to develop.
"
"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests look for the presence of Babesia DNA in a biological sample, usually whole blood in dogs. The PCR test has the advantage that it can detect all four species of Babesia. It is more sensitive because it does not use a microscope.
"
"The FDA-approved treatment for babesiosis is imidocarb dipropionate, an antiprotozoal drug commonly used for treatment of large Babesia species. This is an injection given by a veterinarian. In some cases, antibiotics will also be recommended, such as azithromycin and/or clindamycin.
"
"Specific treatment depends on the babesia species identified and the severity of the disease. More severely affected dogs will require anti-inflammatory or steroid medications, hospitalization, IV fluids, blood transfusions, oxygen therapy, anti-nausea medications, and other supportive care. Blood transfusions may be lifesaving in very anemic animals and are commonly performed in dogs.
"
"If an imidocarb injection is used, a single dose is usually successful for eliminating Babesia canis (large organism), but two injections given two weeks apart are needed for the smaller Babesia species. The injection is often painful and it can cause muscle tremors, drooling, elevated heart rate, shivering, fever, facial swelling, tearing of the eyes, and restlessness.
"
"Your veterinarian will want to monitor your dog’s progress and will schedule regular follow-up appointments to repeat blood work and urine testing. Two to three consecutive negative PCR tests beginning two months after treatment should be performed to make sure your dog’s treatment was successful and infection does not persist.
"
"Most cases of babesiosis will not be diagnosed until the disease is fairly progressed. The prognosis for a dog diagnosed with babesiosis is guarded, depending on what body systems are affected at the time of diagnosis.
"
"Pet parents should be aware that dogs that have survived babesiosis often remain subclinically infected and may suffer a relapse of disease in the future. These persistently infected dogs serve as a source for the further spread of disease in each area. Dogs that have recovered from babesiosis should never be used as donors for blood transfusions because the recipients may develop the disease.
"
"Preventing exposure to ticks by using appropriate tick-control products and removing any ticks promptly will help keep your dog from being exposed to this parasite. Prevention also centers around control of dog-to-dog transmission through blood, such as in dog bites, mother dog to puppies, and blood transfusions.
"
"Dogs should receive regular tick prevention with a collar, a topical medicine applied to the skin, or a chew/pill taken by mouth. Products that prevent ticks, including parasite preventatives such as Revolution, Bravecto, and NexGard or tick collars such as Preventic and Seresto, can be used. Be sure to follow your veterinarian’s advice when using these products.
"
"Keep grass and brush trimmed in your yard. In areas where ticks are a considerable problem, you can treat the yard and kennel area for ticks as well.
"
"Common symptoms include lack of energy, lack of appetite, and fever.
"
"If left untreated, babesiosis can cause death by severe anemia and/or liver disease.
"
"Cerebral babesiosis refers to infection of the brain with Babesia organisms, resulting in neurological symptoms. This form of babesiosis is rare in dogs but can cause seizures and other neurologic symptoms that might alter your dog’s consciousness or mental activity.

"Actinomycosis is an infectious disease caused by gram positive, branching, pleomorphic (can change shape somewhat between a rod and coccus), rod-shaped bacteria of the genus Actinomyces, most commonly the A. viscosus species. Able to survive with little (microaerophilic) or no oxygen (anaerobic), Actinomyces is rarely found as the single bacterial agent in a lesion. It is more often a component of a polymicrobial infection with several bacteria present. In fact, there may even be synergism between Actinomyces and other organisms.
"
"Actinomycosis is thought to occur as an opportunistic infection; i.e., Actinomyces spp. is a normal inhabitant of dog's mouth, but cuts, scrapes, or bite wounds in the mucosa or skin can cause an imbalance in the bacterial microenvironment. Other risk factors include  periodontal disease and immunosuppressive disorders.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel. X-rays of dogs with actinomycosis will typically demonstrate periosteal (outer layer of bone) new bone production, reactive osteosclerosis (hardening of bone), and osteolysis (dissolution of bone).
"
"For a more definitive diagnosis your veterinarian will submit a specimen of pus or osteolytic bone fragments for culturing. Gram staining, cytology, and acid-fast staining may also be employed.
"
"
"
"The dog's abscesses will be drained and lavaged for several days. In some cases, a penrose drain will be utilized, whereby a soft rubber tube is placed in the affected area to prevent fluid buildup. Depending on the severity of the infection, your veterinarian may also need to debride (cut open and/or remove tissue) or remove bone, which will require surgery.
"
"Many veterinarians recommend the administration of antibiotics for a minimum of three to four months after the resolution of all signs. This will assist in fighting against other commonly associated microbes.
"
"Observe the affected area for signs of infection and contact a veterinarian if the following signs are noted: itching, swelling, redness and/or draining. Otherwise, your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your pet closely for recurrence. Redevelopment of infection at the initial site should be expected in about half of the cases.

"Ataxia refers to abnormal body movements and lack of coordination, which can occur when there is damage to a dog’s nervous system (the brain, spinal cord, or nerves). This damage prevents proper communication between the brain and body.
"
"Symptoms of ataxia can vary widely, depending on what area of the nervous system is affected. Ataxia in dogs requires immediate medical attention so your veterinarian can identify the underlying cause and start appropriate treatment.
"
"There are three types of ataxia in dogs: proprioceptive, cerebellar, and vestibular. While the signs may overlap, there are key differences:
"
"Proprioceptive ataxia occurs after damage to the spinal cord or brainstem. Dogs use proprioception to sense where their body parts are in relation to one another and their environment. Dogs have difficulty in placing their feet and walking normally. They may drag their back legs, knuckle over (drag their front or back legs), or appear unsteady when walking. Proprioceptive ataxia can affect the front legs, back legs, or both.
"
"Cerebellar ataxia occurs when the brain’s cerebellum is damaged. The cerebellum’s main function is to coordinate movement and balance. A dog with cerebellar ataxia usually makes exaggerated movements when walking or has a wide stance when standing. In some cases, dogs may sway back and forth due to their inability to maintain balance.  
"
"Vestibular ataxia is caused from damage to the inner ear or brainstem. The vestibular system is responsible for balance and positioning; dogs experience a loss of equilibrium when it is damaged. This usually results from an ear infection or severe inflammation within the ear canal. Dogs with vestibular ataxia usually have a head tilt. They may also start circling or falling to a certain side when trying to stand up or walk.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Regardless of the type of ataxia present, most dogs will display at least one of the following signs:
"
"Abnormal gait
"
"Loss of balance
"
"Wide stance
"
"Stumbling
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Dogs with cerebellar ataxia may display exaggerated movements or tremors when walking, while dogs with proprioceptive ataxia may drag their legs or cross them over one another. Circling, falling to one side, and vomiting are common in dogs with vestibular ataxia. Abnormal eye movements, known as nystagmus, and a head tilt may also be present.
"
"There are numerous causes of ataxia in dogs. Some are mild, while others are severe. These causes include but are not limited to the following:
"
"Systemic infections, such as canine distemper virus  
"
"Intervertebral disc disease, the degeneration of one or more of the discs separating the bones of the spine
"
"Infection or inflammation of the brain, spine, or ear
"
"Tumors of the brain, spine, or ear
"
"Idiopathic vestibular disease, a condition that affects the inner and middle ear
"
"Head trauma
"
"Hypothyroidism
"
"Congenital defects, such as cerebellar hypoplasia or liver shunts
"
"Nutritional imbalances
"
"Hypoglycemia
"
"Medication interactions or overdoses
"
"Toxin ingestion, such as rodenticides or ethylene glycol
"
"A veterinarian will first gather a history and perform a complete physical exam. If ataxia is present, various tests can be done to determine the underlying cause. These tests include:
"
"Otoscopic exam: The veterinarian will look into the ear canal to visualize the ear drum and identify areas of swelling, inflammation, or infection if vestibular ataxia is suspected.
"
"Blood work: A sample of blood is taken to check red and white blood cells, platelets, clotting abilities, and internal organ function. This test can identify signs of inflammation, infection, underlying diseases, and toxin exposure.
"
"Complete neurological exam: During this test, the veterinarian will assess the nervous system, including posture, gait, nerves, and reflexes, to identify any abnormalities that warrant further testing.
"
"Imaging: These tests provide detailed pictures of the nervous and vestibular systems. They help the veterinarian identify the site of damage that is causing the ataxia. Imaging may include an X-ray, a CT scan, or an MRI. These are non-invasive tests, but dogs may need sedation or anesthesia for them.
"
"Cerebral spinal fluid analysis: This is an invasive test performed by a specialist in which a small sample of fluid is collected from the spine to test for infection and inflammation that may be causing the ataxia.
"
"Treatment includes identifying and managing the underlying cause of ataxia. Treatment options may include the following: 
"
"Anti-inflammatories, such as prednisone
"
"Antibiotics, including clindamycin
"
"Antifungals, such as itraconazole
"
"Pain medications, such as gabapentin
"
"Exercise restriction
"
"Physical therapy
"
"Some dogs with ataxia may require hospitalization for monitoring and supportive care. Surgery may be required if ataxia is caused by spinal cord compression or tumor.  
"
"There are times when ataxia can be resolved with rest and medical care; however, some cases of ataxia are incurable, and the condition can only be managed.  
"
"Ataxia that is curable will usually resolve once the underlying cause has been identified and appropriately treated. This can range anywhere from weeks to months, and frequent rechecks by the veterinarian will be needed to ensure the dog’s symptoms are improving. Some cases of ataxia, such as those caused from congenital defects, will never be cured.
"
"Dogs recovering from ataxia should have a safe, comfortable space at home to rest. Care must be taken to keep the dog away from any stairs or potentially dangerous objects. Recovering dogs may need help with potty breaks and meals. Pet parents should always listen to their veterinarian’s recommendations and give medications as prescribed.
"
"Many cases of ataxia in dogs cannot be prevented because they occur due to underlying medical conditions. In these situations, pet parents should ensure their dogs receive regular veterinary checkups, and that they stay up to date on preventative care to identify any health problems early on. Ataxia caused by toxin exposure or medication overdoses can be prevented by ensuring toxic chemicals are out of a dog’s reach, and by giving medications only as prescribed.
"
"In certain instances, dogs may recover from ataxia with rest and supportive care. This is when the dog has a treatable condition, such as an ear infection or toxin exposure. However, if there is severe damage to the nervous system, ataxia can progressively worsen and lead to poor quality of life.
"
"Ataxia can be a side effect of several medications, including gabapentin, metronidazole, and ivermectin. Anesthetics, sedatives, seizure medications, opioids, diuretics, and aminoglycoside antibiotics also have the potential to cause ataxia in some dogs. These side effects should resolve once the medication is out of the dog’s system.
"
"Ataxia will not resolve on its own. All dogs with ataxia should be brought to a veterinarian immediately for evaluation. The veterinarian can determine what type of medical intervention is appropriate, based on your dog’s symptoms and overall condition.

"Aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, has beneficial effects including anti-platelet, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. However, it can also be toxic. Once ingested, aspirin forms salicylic acid, which is then distributed throughout the body.
"
"Dog owners must therefore follow their veterinarian's orders strictly if they use aspirin for any reason.
"
"The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"One of the first noticeable signs is loss of appetite. Other signs include vomiting, diarrhea, and intestinal hemorrhage brought on by ulceration in the stomach and small intestines. The central nervous system is affected and the dog may have trouble walking, appear weak and uncoordinated, or even collapse. Loss of consciousness and sudden death can also occur.
"
"Since nontoxic levels can produce these symptoms, owners should monitor for any digestive problems or change in behavior when giving their dog aspirin for any medical reason. If a significant amount of aspirin is ingested, emergency treatment is necessary.
"
"If you know or suspect your dog has ingested aspirin, diagnostic tests should focus on the severity of the toxicity. A blood sample will be taken to assess cell counts and serum chemistries. Usually the dog is anemic and has electrolyte abnormalities. Additional blood may also be taken to assess its clotting ability.
"
"
"
"Dogs treated within 12 hours with limited signs of distress can have the concentration of aspirin in the body decreased through a prescribed treatment of decontamination. The sooner this care begins, the better. The veterinarian may also recommend you to induce vomiting at home before coming to the clinic for treatment. By inducing vomiting, or pumping the stomach (gastric lavage), the veterinarian will remove as much aspirin as possible. Activated charcoal may be given after vomiting to absorb the aspirin.
"
"Medications that encourage healing or protect the gastrointestinal lining are also generally prescribed. Depending on the dog's status, fluids and other supportive treatments may be necessary. Hospitalization and repeated blood analysis is often necessary until the dog is stable.
"
"Aspirin has several clinical uses. It can be prescribed as a pain reliever, an anti-inflammatory, an anti-platelet agent, and for lowering body temperature. If aspirin is used for a chronic condition, such as to prevent a blockage of the blood vessel (arterial thromboembolism), it is important to follow the veterinarian’s directions, and reducing or discontinuing the aspirin dosage may be necessary if the dog is susceptible to toxicity.

"Aspiration pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs caused by an inhaled material such as food, regurgitation, or vomit. 
"
"
This condition usually happens when there is an underlying problem with the normal reflexes of swallowing and pushing material down the esophagus. In aspiration pneumonia, food makes its way into the airways and is inhaled into the lungs.
"
"In a normal anatomic structure, once food is chewed and mixed with saliva (food bolus), it is ready to be swallowed. The food bolus is then pushed by the tongue to the throat (pharynx). This space, called the pharynx, meets the end of the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), and is separated by a thin membrane of tissue called the soft palate. 
"
"The larynx is the opening into the trachea. The pharynx and larynx are separated by a piece of cartilage called the epiglottis. The epiglottis is part of the structures known as the voice box. 
"
"The tongue is a large muscle that extends down the throat and attaches to other muscles and cartilage around the epiglottis. 
The tongue, soft palate, and epiglottis work together to close the space leading into the trachea (larynx) and allow a food bolus to continue down the esophagus and finally into the stomach and intestines. When swallowing, there is a momentary stop in breathing to ensure that food travels down the correct path of the esophagus. 
"
"With aspiration pneumonia, the laryngeal reflex gets overwhelmed, or it does not function properly, so food and liquid make their way into the larynx, down the trachea, and into the lungs.  
"
"Aspiration pneumonia can involve obstruction of the large airways and result in acute respiratory distress if large particles are inhaled. This would be considered a medical emergency. If you believe your dog is experiencing this, contact an emergency veterinary hospital immediately. 
"
"Commonly, smaller particles are inhaled and may block small airways which leads  to an inflammatory response that produces mucus and inflammatory cells that create a tightening of the muscles of the airways, known as a bronchospasm.  This leads to coughing, wheezing, and overall makes it uncomfortable to fully breathe in and out.    
"
"Another phase of aspiration pneumonia involves damage from inhaling acidic gastric enzymes. This change in pH easily damages the respiratory surface layer (epithelium) and lung surfactant (a chemical substance that aids in breathing) function. This may cause bronchospasms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can result in a medical emergency. 
"
"Lastly, a bacterial pneumonia may develop. The level of infection may overwhelm a dog’s immune system instantly or may occur later in the disease. 
 
"

"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia in dogs may include:
"
"Vomiting, regurgitation, or difficulty swallowing 
"
"Coughing
"
"Exercise intolerance
"
"Fever
"
"Nasal discharge
"
"Difficulty breathing or respiratory distress
"
"Breathing at a fast rate, but may not be panting
"
"Cyanotic or blue gums and tongue
"
"Examples of instances that lead to aspiration pneumonia in puppies include:
"
"Bottle-feeding puppies that have a normal anatomy but may choke on milk that pours out of the bottle too quickly.
"
"Force-feeding a mentally dull animal that may be unable to swallow properly.
"
" A puppy with cleft palate where milk enters the nasal cavity and continues down into the lungs.
"
"The most common cause of aspiration pneumonia in adult dogs is regurgitation due to a dilated esophagus (megaesophagus). Regurgitation is different from vomiting; it is a passive response that expels the contents from the esophagus usually before the food reaches the stomach. It can be delayed for several hours, or it can occur shortly after eating. Often, ingesta (food material) can be seen in a tubular form and appear undigested.  
"
"Regurgitation may occur as a result of stress or anesthesia especially in brachycephalic breeds such as: Boston Terriers, Pugs, Frenchie, Bullmastiff, Cane Corso, Boxer, English and American Bulldogs, and Dogue de Bordeaux. 
"
"Vomiting is an active response that requires the contraction of the abdominal muscles to actively propel food and liquid (may also include yellow bile) out of the stomach and small intestines.
"
"Other causes of aspiration pneumonia include: 
"

"Dogs with aspiration pneumonia may be in shock and require aggressive care to stabilize them.  
"
"If your dog does not have any signs of respiratory distress, your veterinarian may order bloodwork to look for an infection. Your vet may also order X-rays to look for a bronchoalveolar pattern in the gravity-dependent lung lobes. 
"
"If your dog is in respiratory distress, a vet will ensure there is no visible obstruction by performing an oral exam to look in the mouth and the back of the throat. If a large obstruction is suspected, a bronchoscopy can be performed. An arterial blood gas test to measure oxygen may also be a part of the monitoring and evaluation in an emergency facility. 
"
"To diagnose aspiration pneumonia, your vet will perform a tracheal or a bronchoalveolar wash to collect a sample of cells in the trachea or lungs. 
"
"There are other medical reasons that your dog could develop aspiration pneumonia. Each medical condition has a unique test:
"
"Thyroid test (to diagnose hypothyroidism) 
"
"Adrenal function test (to diagnose hypoadrenocorticism, also known as Addison’s Disease, and polyneuropathy)
"
"Antiacetylcholine antibodies test (to diagnose myasthenia gravis)
"
"Antinuclear antibodies test (to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus)
"
"Fluoroscopy imaging with contrast (to diagnose a swallowing disorder, or dysphagia)
"
"In severe cases of aspiration pneumonia, your dog may need to be hospitalized at a 24-hour facility that can provide an oxygen cage, bronchodilators to open airways, IV fluid therapy and antibiotics, and anti-nausea and gastrointestinal motility medications.
"
"In mild cases, outpatient therapy may be possible. The prognosis depends on the underlying disease that caused the regurgitation and subsequent aspiration pneumonia.  
 
"
"The general timeline for recovery from aspiration pneumonia is at least 10 days after the resolution of symptoms. The key to treating pneumonia is to not stop therapy too soon. Treatment can last between 2 and 8 weeks, depending on the severity and underlying cause of the aspiration pneumonia.  
"
"Prevention and prognosis of aspiration pneumonia greatly depends on the underlying cause. If the underlying cause is serious, and there is a high likelihood for more infections, then the prognosis is poor.
"
"Dogs can recover from aspiration pneumonia if treated aggressively and appropriately.
"
"Clinical signs of aspiration pneumonia may be obvious immediately, or it may take days to weeks for symptoms to develop.

"Juvenile polyarteritis, also referred to medically as beagle pain syndrome, is a systemic disease that is seemingly of genetic origin, affecting only certain breeds. It is most commonly reported in young beagles, although a similar syndrome has been reported in other breeds, most notably boxers and Bernese mountain dogs. This disease is rare, and can be defined as a simultaneous inflammation of an artery, or several arteries, with irritation, or infection, of the small vessels in the spinal cord in the neck and in the heart.
"
"Symptoms of the condition seem to come and go, with indications that suggest a serious bacterial infection: high fever, pain, and a high white blood cell count. This common misdiagnoses makes juvenile polyarteritis difficult to treat, since antibiotics have no effect. If your veterinarian does not suspect beagle pain syndrome, and your pet is showing indications of this condition, it would be wise to ask your doctor to consider it. Especially if your dog has already gone through a course of antibiotics. This condition can also be referenced as necrotizing vasculitis: inflammation and tissue death of a vessel.
"
"For a beagle puppy that is suffering from this condition, opening the jaw will seem to be painful, and the puppy will be reluctant to bark. The symptoms usually will become apparent when the puppy is four to ten months of age, but the condition can manifest at an older age as well. It may resolve itself without treatment, but even if it does, it will typically return within a few months.
"
"A latent genetic factor is believed to be one of the causes for juvenile polyarteritis, since only some breeds are susceptible. Medical researchers also suspect a related auto-immune factor.
"
"Bacterial meningitis, inflammation of a vertebral disc, spinal tumor, and cervical disc disease should be ruled out before confirming a diagnosis of juvenile polyarteritis. X-rays tend not to show evidence of disease if necrotizing vasculitis is present. A spinal tap is usually better for determining the nature of the disease. While this is a form of meningitis, its source is not bacterial, so antibacterial medications will not resolve the condition.
"
"Your veterinarian will need to conduct a full blood work-up for further confirmation, and the lab results may show anemia (low red blood cells), a high white blood cell count indicating infection, or other blood abnormalities. There will usually be an attendant fever, also an indication of infection.
"
"
"
"Prednisone, an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive medication similar to cortisone, is the usual treatment of choice. Patients tend to show rapid improvement in just a few days, but even so, relapses often occur when the medication is discontinued. Continuing treatment for a longer period of time, like six months, will sometimes result in permanent resolution. At the outset of therapy, steroid treatment should be administered at a level that will produce a remission of the symptoms, and then your veterinarian can recommend a regimen of oral therapy. Over the course of treatment, the amount will be reduced slowly to the lowest possible dose needed to control symptoms. If symptoms return, steroid treatment will need to begin again.
"
"One of the side effects of steroid treatment is fluid retention and increased thirst. To prevent accidents or discomfort on your dog's behalf, you will need to take your dog out frequently for urination, even if only for a small amount. A calm, quiet environment, where your pet will not be stimulated, is important. Moving will be painful during the recovery process, and it will benefit your dog if you give it an isolated space, away from children or animals, at least until the symptoms have subsided. Even after recovery, you will need to be alert to the possibility that your dog may have a relapse.

"Ascites, also known as an abdominal effusion or free abdominal fluid, is a serious, possibly life-threatening medical condition in which a dog’s abdomen fills up with fluid. The abdomen contains important organs such as the liver, pancreas, stomach, intestines, spleen, and urinary bladder, with little to no fluid surrounding them. When a dog has ascites, these organs are free-floating in the abdomen.
"
"There are a wide variety of reasons why a dog would develop ascites, most of them related to major organ failure within the abdomen or from other areas of the body. Ascites is a secondary condition that develops from an underlying medical problem.
"
"The amount and type of fluid that accumulates in the abdomen can vary depending on the underlying condition. With large amounts of fluid, the abdomen enlarges and pushes on the chest cavity. This can cause the lungs to not be able to expand fully, causing trouble breathing or even respiratory failure.
"
"   
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"When there are small amounts of fluid in the abdomen, the signs can be the same as with general , and at times can be mild. With larger amounts of fluid and more serious underlying causes, the symptoms can become more severe. Some include:
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite or anorexia
"
"Vomiting or retching
"
"Diarrhea, increased or decreased frequency of bowel movements
"
"Weakness
"
"Distended abdomen
"
"Weight gain
"
"Restlessness
"
"Excessive panting
"
"Increased thirst, increased urination
"
"Pain upon palpation of the abdomen
"
"Vocalizing when laying down
"
"Pale, blue, or purple gums
"
"Fainting (syncope)
"
"Coughing
"
"Rapid, shallow breathing
"
"Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
"
"Since ascites is an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, it causes bloating. This secondary condition indicates a more serious primary cause, which should be examined by your veterinarian as soon as possible. Common primary conditions that cause ascites in dogs are:
"
"Heart disease: right-sided heart disease (most common cause of free fluid in the abdomen of dogs), right-sided congestive heart failure, heartworm disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, and pulmonic stenosis.
"
"Liver: chronic liver failure and hepatitis; portal hypertension
"
"Proteins: low protein concentrations (decreased albumin); protein losing enteropathy (gastrointestinal protein loss) and protein losing nephropathy (kidney disease); nephrotic syndrome (kidney disease).
"
"Trauma to a dog’s body: can cause organs to burst, leaking fluid into the abdomen; urine leaking from the bladder or urinary system causes a uroabdomen; and damage to the liver or spleen causes free-floating blood in the abdomen.
"
"Peritonitis: this is an infection in the lining of the abdominal wall that can lead to free-floating fluid in the abdomen.
"
"Poison: rat poison ingestion can cause a dog’s blood to clot improperly. This is another cause of free-floating blood in the abdomen.   
"
"Cancer: It causes free-floating fluid in the abdomen for a variety of reasons, from a ruptured organ, pressure on major blood vessels, or inflammation due to a tumor—all of which can cause blood or other bodily fluids to cause ascites.
"
"If your dog has any abdominal enlargement or is showing signs associated with free-floating fluid in the abdomen, they should be examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination of your dog. Ascites may be detectable on palpation (the process of feeling or touching) of the abdomen or with an abdominal ultrasound or x-rays.
"
"The type of fluid in the abdomen depends on the underlying cause. If your dog is stable and not in any distress, your vet can take a sample of the fluid with a small needle passed through the abdominal wall. They will then look at the fluid under a microscope and try to determine what kind of fluid is present. This will help them target the possible primary medical condition causing the free-floating fluid in the abdomen. It is also important to run baseline lab work such as a complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, and urinalysis to evaluate your dog and help determine the underlying cause of the ascites
"
"Once your veterinarian has diagnosed your dog’s condition, often the first step in the treatment plan is to remove the fluid. This is not often a cure, as the fluid will likely build back up again, but it can help establish the cause of the ascites.
"
"The treatment plan will remove the abnormal fluid and also address the underlying medical condition. Sometimes a surgical procedure is necessary to treat the primary cause, such as a tumor or damaged organs. Not all causes of free-floating fluid in the abdomen require surgery, but almost all dogs with ascites do need to be hospitalized while being treated.
"
"Intravenous (IV) medications such as the diuretics furosemide and spironolactone are often given to help absorb some of the fluid. Diuretics are often most helpful when right-sided heart disease or heart failure is the cause of the ascites. With anemia and low protein levels, a blood or plasma transfusion is often necessary.
"
"Medications to help with liver and kidney dysfunction are also important, if necessary. Your dog might require a special diet for the rest of their life, such as with protein loss from a gastrointestinal condition or right-sided heart disease.
"
"Given the wide range of probable causes of ascites, a prognosis can only be made once an underlying diagnosis is determined. Surgery may be needed to manage some of the emergency causes of abdominal fluid. In other cases, the condition may be managed with medication. There are some conditions that cause ascites that are manageable or even curable.
"
"Unfortunately, some conditions may not be treatable. Although ascites is not always caused by a life-threatening condition, it can often indicate a very poor outcome, especially in older dogs and those that may be diagnosed with cancer.
"
"If your dog has a distended abdomen it should never be ignored, as it may be a sign of a serious disease. It is also crucial that you follow your veterinarian’s advice for a possible quick recovery.

"
"The atlantoaxial (AA) joint in dogs is located between the first and second neck vertebrae. The first vertebra, or atlas, and the second vertebra, or axis, are held together by ligaments (instead of a disc), which allows a dog to move their head from side to side.
"
"While an uncommon condition, atlantoaxial instability, or AA instability (AAI), in dogs happens when the two bones are not aligned and cause friction by rubbing against the spinal cord and nerves, which results in severe neck pain and progressive neurologic symptoms. 
"
" 
"
"Dogs will typically have increasing neck pain—yelping or crying when touched—but they can also show the following symptoms:
"
"Stiff neck
"
"Low head carriage (head appears bowed)
"
"Inability to stand or walk
"
"Abnormal gait or ataxia (i.e., a drunken-like walk)
"
"Difficulty or pain when eating or drinking
"
"Rarely, apnea (lack of breathing), attributed to paralysis of the diaphragm
"
"Death
"
"It’s important to note that symptoms can be caused by injuries—even minor bumps—and symptoms can happen randomly or be seen all the time.
"
"AA instability is commonly due to a congenital birth defect, either in how the cervical bones (C1 and C2) fit together, the ligaments that connect them, or in the bones themselves. Additionally, trauma, such as being hit by a car, running into objects, or extreme rough play can cause the condition.   
"
"AA instability most often occurs in younger smaller-breed dogs such as Chihuahuas, Pekingese, Pomeranians, Toy Poodles, and Yorkshire Terriers, but the condition has also been seen in larger breeds like Rottweilers and Doberman Pinschers. 
"
"In addition to a physical exam, where the dog will often exhibit pain in their neck and decreased range of motion, bloodwork and urinalysis screenings can be helpful in eliminating other causes and aid in further examination. A full neurologic exam will be performed to test reflexes and cranial nerves, and X-rays will most likely be recommended.
"
"Referral to a veterinary neurologist may also be recommended to perform advanced imaging procedures such as CT, MRI, and even a CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) tap to help determine the extent of spinal cord injury. 
"
"For some dogs with minor discomfort or instability, conservative management with strict crate rest for multiple weeks, along with pain medications (such as gabapentin, tramadol, or other opioids, NSAIDs, or steroids) and a neck brace may be an option.
"
"Surgery is, by far, the best option for dogs suffering from this condition, and even though it can be risky given the close proximity to the brain and spinal cord, it does provide the best chance of survival and long-term quality of life. The goal of the surgery is to minimize, if not eliminate, pain and to stabilize the joint, often through screws and bone cement. Dogs that have pre-existing medical conditions are not good candidates for anesthesia.
"
"Without surgery, the prognosis for AAI is guarded, and symptoms can persist and progress to the point where quality of life is affected.
"
"For dogs being managed with medications only, it is critical that they be protected from any type of trauma, even minor bumps and scratches, as clinical signs can reoccur and have devastating consequences. Even with the utmost care and consideration, signs can recur and become progressive, as mentioned above. 
"
"Dogs that have undergone successful surgery can go on to live a functional and normal life, although refraining from high-impact activities or rough play is still advised to prevent further trauma or failure of the surgery. 
"
"Dogs that have neurologic signs or excessive dysfunction at the time of surgery have a much more guarded prognosis and may still suffer with neurologic problems afterward. The recovery period after surgery is often many weeks, with follow-up visits to the veterinarian for repeat X-rays to ensure proper healing and function. After surgery, dogs should be reintroduced to exercise gradually. Raised food and water bowls are helpful to minimize the amount of neck movement.

"Lilies aren’t just dangerous to cats—they pose a risk to dogs, too.
"
"While lethal lily poisonings are rare in dogs, lilies are still considered to be poisonous to our canine companions. You should be aware of lily toxicity in dogs so you can help keep your pets protected.
"
"Here’s everything you need to know about lily poisoning in dogs, including the types of toxic lilies, signs of lily toxicity and treatment methods.
"
"Steer clear of lilies in general when choosing plants for your garden or indoor décor. While not all types of lilies are highly toxic to dogs, the majority of lilies can cause an upset tummy or other uncomfortable reactions.
"
"Prairie Lily (Rain Lily): These types of lilies can be poisonous to dogs. The bulbs of these lilies are the most poisonous part of the plant and can cause mild to severe gastrointestinal (GI) upset in dogs.
"
"Lily of the Valley: This plant contains cardio glycosides, which are gastrointestinal irritants. If a dog eats the leaves, flower or root of this lily, it can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, slowed heart rate, severe heart arrhythmias, seizures and, in severe cases, even death.
"
"Peace Lily: The peace lily plant contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals, which are absorbed into the skin tissue and cause mouth and GI tract irritation. If a dog chews on any part of this plant, the crystals can cause intense burning and irritation of the mouth, tongue and lips. It can also cause excessive drooling, vomiting and difficulty swallowing.
"
"Calla Lily: Similar to the peace lily, the calla lily also contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Even just a nibble of this plant can lead to exposure to the crystals and adverse symptoms. The crystals can cause oral irritation, excessive drooling, difficulty swallowing, vomiting and a decreased appetite.
"
"If you suspect that your dog has ingested or chewed on any of these types of lilies, take them to your veterinarian.
"
"Compulsive disorder is characterized by a repetitious, relatively unchanging sequence of activities or movements that has no obvious purpose or function. Although the behavior is usually derived from normal maintenance behaviors (such as grooming, eating, and walking), the repetitive behavior interferes with normal behavioral functioning. It is referred to as “OCD” or “Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.”
"
"The most commonly observed obsessive-compulsive behaviors are spinning, tail chasing, self-mutilation, hallucinating (fly biting), circling, fence running, hair/air biting, pica (appetite for non-food substances such as dirt, rocks or feces), pacing, staring, and vocalizing. Some dogs also show the potential for aggression.
"
"No breed, gender or age of dog is more likely to have obsessive-compulsive disorders, although the specific type of OCD displayed may be affected by breed, such as spinning as opposed to self-mutilation. As with other anxiety disorders, onset of OCD begins early, around 12 to 24 months of age, as the dog developmentally matures (generally defined as occurring at 12 to 36 months of age in dogs). If you are observing early signs of obsessive behavior in your dog, and it is descended from a line where other dogs are affected, early intervention is critical.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your dog. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, including a background history of symptoms, any information you have about your dog's familial line, and possible incidents that might have precipitated the behavior. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis in order to rule out underlying physical causes or disease.
"
" 
"
"If all of the physical tests fail to confirm a cause for the behavior, a veterinary behaviorist may be consulted. Treatment is usually conducted on an outpatient basis, however, if your dog is showing severe self-mutilation and self-induced injury, it may need to be hospitalized. Your dog will need to be protected from the environment until the anti-anxiety medications reach effective levels, which may require days or weeks of therapy, constant monitoring, stimulation, and care. Sedation may be necessary in severe cases.
"
"Your veterinarian will prescribe anti-anxiety medication along with a behavior modification program. If possible, videotape your dog as soon as the behavior begins. A pattern may become clear. Any itchy skin diseases should be diagnosed by your veterinarian, since itchiness and pain/discomfort are related to anxiety.
"
"Behavior modification will be geared toward teaching the dog to relax in a variety of environmental settings, and to substitute a calm, competitive, or desired behavior for the obsessive-compulsive one. Desensitization and counter conditioning are most effective when instituted early, so it is essential to begin these techniques as soon as you become aware of compulsive behaviorisms in your dog. The training may be coupled with a verbal cue that signals the dog to execute a behavior that is competitive with the abnormal one (for example, instead of circling, the patient is taught to relax and lie down with its head and neck stretched prone on the floor when it is told, “head down”).
"
"Punishment should be avoided, as it can lead to greater anxiety and may make the behavior worse, or lead to the dog’s being more secretive. Confinement or excessive physical restraint should also not be used to the anxiety that is provoked. Avoid bandages, collars, braces, and crates; all serve to focus the dog more on the center of its distress and will make it feel worse. If these are needed to ensure healing, they should be used for a minimal amount of time or as your veterinarian recommends.
"
"Monitor behaviors via weekly videotaping and/or written logs, with times, dates, and the behavior leading up to the obsessive behavior tracked. This will provide unbiased assessments of change and help with alterations in treatment plans. Your veterinarian will schedule biannual visits with you and your dog to obtain complete blood counts, biochemistry profile and urinalysis, to be sure that the body is healthy and not contributing to your dog's anxiety or distress. Observe for vomiting, gastrointestinal distress, and rapid breathing. If these symptoms are identified, contact your veterinarian.
"
"The Peruvian lily, tiger lily, daylily and Easter lily are all classified as nontoxic to dogs.
"
"While these types of lilies may be classified as nontoxic, they can still cause unpleasant reactions in a dog. The introduction of any new, novel foods into any pet’s diet can cause GI upset.
"
"At the end of the day, it is best to keep any plants in your home out of reach of your pets.
"
"The symptoms of lily poisoning in dogs will vary depending on which type of lily they got ahold of. If you are not sure which lily your dog ingested, the most common symptoms to look for include:
"
"Vomiting
"
"Diarrhea
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Excessive drooling
"
"Pawing at the face due to oral irritation (limited to calla lilies and peace lilies)
"
"Heart problems are possible with ingestion of lily of the valley
"
"Symptoms will often start within two hours of ingestion, so if you start to notice your pup displaying these signs, it is time to call your veterinarian.
"
"Treatment will depend upon how long ago the ingestion occurred, what type of lily it was and your dog’s clinical signs.
"
"If you are certain the ingestion occurred within an hour and you can’t get to the vet quickly, your veterinarian may recommend that you induce vomiting with hydrogen peroxide to help remove the irritants. Call your veterinarian prior to inducing vomiting, and let them prescribe the correct and safe dose.
"
"If you can get your dog to veterinarian quickly, the vet can safely administer hydrogen peroxide or apomorphine. Apomorphine works like an eye drop and induces vomiting in dogs.
"
"
If it has been over an hour since ingestion, a veterinarian may administer activated charcoal to help absorb the toxins and remove them from the body. Blood work will likely need to be evaluated to watch for any organ toxicity.
"
"Additional medications to protect the GI tract and organs may be administered, along with IV fluids to dilute the poison that may have been absorbed.
"
"Ingesting most lilies won’t necessitate hospitalization for dogs; however, lily of the valley is the most likely exception. In these cases, hospitalization for a day or two may be recommended.

"Medications may take several weeks to show an effect on the target behavior - the first sign of efficacy may be changes in the duration or frequency of bouts rather than total cessation of the undesired behaviors. Setting realistic expectations for change will help you manage the outcome of behavioral and medical intervention. Relapses are common and to be expected during stressful or new situations.
"
"Don’t try to reassure your pet that it does not have to spin, chew, or perform other repetitive behaviors; this inadvertently rewards the repetitive behavior. Reward the dog only when it is not engaged in behavior and is relaxed. However, the behavior should not be entirely ignored. If left untreated, these conditions almost always progress to more serious levels.

"The purpose of an anticoagulant is to prevent the coagulation (clotting) of blood. These agents are commonly used in rat and mouse poisons, and are one of the most common household poisons, accounting for a large number of accidental poisoning among dogs. When ingested by an animal, anticoagulants block the synthesis of vitamin K, an essential component for normal blood clotting, which results in spontaneous and uncontrolled bleeding.
"
"Normally, dogs that have mild anticoagulant poisoning will not show signs of poisoning for several days, but as the poison begins to affect the system, the dog will become weak and pale due to blood loss. The bleeding may be external; this may be displayed as a nose bleed, bloody vomit, or bleeding from the rectum. Dogs can also suffer from unseen internal bleeding; bleeding into the chest or abdomen, for example, is fatal if it not diagnosed in time.
"
"Here are some of the most common symptoms of anticoagulant poisoning:
"
"The main cause of anticoagulant poisoning is from the ingestion of rodent poison. If you suspect that your dog has come into contact with rat or mouse poison, and you are seeing some of the symptoms listed above, you will need to bring your dog to a veterinarian before your pet's health becomes critical.
"
"Keep in mind that outdoor dogs (or dogs that go outside frequently) are at risk of rodent poisoning. It might be in a neighbor's yard, in a trash bag, or in an alleyway. Dogs that engage in chasing and killing rodents may also be susceptible to this type of poisoning. Even if you do not live in an area where rats or mice are a concern, rodent poison may be used for other common suburban pests like raccoons, opossums, or squirrels.
"
"Some of the main anticoagulant chemicals that can be found in rodent poisons (or other household products) are:
"
"The first kind of anticoagulants are cumulative poisons. These poisons contain warfarin and hydroxycoumadin as main anticoagulants and they require multiple feedings that take several days to kill a rodent.
"
"The second type of anticoagulant is deadlier, killing rodents in a single serving dose rather than over time. These deadlier anticoagulant poisons contain indanedione class products, like pindone, diphacinone, diphenadione and chlorohacinone, all of which are extremely toxic. Rodenticides that contain the ingredients bromadiolone and brodifacoum, for example, are 50 to 200 times more poisonous than the kind that contain warfarin and hydroxycoumadin.
"
"Another cause of anticoagulant poisoning in dogs is the accidental ingestion of medication. Heparin, a common drug for treating blood clotting in humans, can have a toxic effect on animals. Often, dogs that have access to medications will eat what they have found, either because the drugs are within reach, or because the drug cabinet is kept unlocked.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and recent activities. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. In addition, your doctor will check the time it takes the dog's blood to clot to determine to severity of the poisoning.
"
"If you have a sample of the poison, you will need to take that with you to the veterinarian's office; bringing samples of the dog's vomit and/or stool may also be helpful.
"
"
"
"If your dog is suffering from spontaneous bleeding caused by anticoagulants, the treatment will involve administering fresh whole blood, or frozen plasma, in an amount determined by the rate and volume of the animal's blood loss. Vitamin K, which is necessary for normal blood clotting, will be used specifically as an antidote, and will be given by subcutaneous (under the skin) injections, with repeated doses as necessary -- by injection or even orally -- until the blood clotting time returns to normal.
"
"Do not induce vomiting unless you have been advised to do so by your veterinarian. Some poisons can cause more harm coming back through the esophagus than they did going down.
"
"If your dog consumes a mild cumulative form of an anticoagulant, your dog may recover in a week, but if it was the lethal single dose anticoagulant, it may take up to a month.
"
"Anticoagulant poisoning can be prevented by keeping all poisons out of the reach of your pets. All other chemicals, drugs, and medications (especially blood thinning drugs) should also be kept out of your dog's reach -- ideally inside of a cabinet.

"Traumatic myocarditis is the term applied to the syndrome of arrhythmias – irregular heartbeats – that sometimes complicates a blunt trauma injury to the heart.  It is a misnomer, because heart muscle injuries are more likely to take the form of cell death than inflammation (as the term myocarditis suggests). Direct heart injury may not be necessary for development of post traumatic arrhythmia. Non-heart related conditions are likely to have equal or greater importance in causing arrhythmias.
"
"The prevalence of serious arrhythmias after blunt trauma is relatively low but some patients develop clinically important rhythm disturbances following  trauma to the heart. Therefore, the heart rhythm of all victims of trauma should be carefully assessed.
"
"Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (abnormal patterns of electrical heart beat activity starting in the ventricles) occur in most affected patients. Ventricular rhythms that complicate blunt trauma are often relatively slow and are detected only during pauses in the normal rhythm. They are most appropriately referred to as accelerated idioventricular rhythms (AIVRs), which is recognized by a heart rate that is greater than 100 beats per minute (bpm) but generally less than 160 bpm. Usually, these rhythms are harmless. However, dangerous ventricular tachycardias can also complicate a blunt trauma and can also evolve from seemingly benign AIVRs, placing the patient at risk for sudden death.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Blood tests can be done to check for high serum troponin concentrations, a protein that is involved in the regulation of cardiac muscle contractions, which would suggest myocardial necrosis.
"
"Arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry should be used to determine if the patient is lacking in blood oxygen (hypoxemic). Further diagnostic testing will include X-ray imaging to determine the type of traumatic injuries that are present, and electrocardiogram (ECG) to analyze the ventricular arrhythmias.
"
"
"
"Your dog will be given fluid therapy with electrolytes (if needed) and prescribed painkillers. Oxygen therapy should be given if your dog is hypoxemic. If pneumothorax (air free in the chest cavity - outside the lungs) is present, it will be treated. Antiarrhythmic therapy will only be given if your dog has AIVRs and clinical signs of arrhythmia.
"
"Arrhythmias due to blunt trauma tend to resolve spontaneously within 2-3 days of the beginning of treatment. Anti-arrhythmic therapy can be discontinued after 2-5 days.Although dangerous arrhythmias occasionally complicate blunt trauma, the prognosis for a full recovery usually depends on the severity of extracardiac (outside the heart) injury.

"The term agglutinin refers to an antibody that causes antigens, such as red blood cells or bacteria, to adhere to each each other. Cold agglutinins with low thermal capacity are usually associated with direct red blood cell agglutination (adhesion)  at low body temperatures in the peripheral blood vessel network (i.e., the vessels outside of the main circulatory network). Cold limbs or other peripheral clotting phenomena are initiated or intensified by exposure to cold. This is a rare type II autoimmune disorder in which antibodies that attack red blood cells  have enhanced activity at temperatures of less than 99° F (37.2° C).
"
"Fixation of complement and hemolysis (the release of hemogloblin in the blood stream when a red blood cell breaks) is a warm-reactive process occurring at high body temperatures; therefore, patients may have very high concentrations of cold agglutinins, but these antibodies may be unable to hemolyze red blood cells (erythrocytes) at the warmer temperatures achieved in the bloodstream.
"
"Most cold agglutinins cause little or no shortening of red blood cell life span. High thermal amplitude cold agglutinins (rare) may cause sustained hemolysis, but the resulting anemia is often mild and stable. Exposure to cold may enhance binding of cold agglutinins and complement mediated release of hemoglobin within the vessels (intravascular hemolysis).
"
"A low titer (concentration test) of naturally-occurring cold agglutinins (usually 1:32 or less) may be found in healthy dogs, but this is without clinical significance. The disease has a genetic basis; however, mean age and range, breed, and sex predilections are unknown. The condition is more likely to occur in colder climates.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Diagnosis is made by the historical findings, such as exposure to cold, the results of the physical examination, and demonstrating cold agglutination (adhesion of red blood cells) in vitro.
"
"Skin lesions typically present as inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (erythema), acrocyanosis, and ulceration of the tips of the ears and tail, nose and feet. Other associated conditions to rule out include hepatocutaneous syndrome(skin disease caused caused by liver disease); erythema multiforme (reaction to infection or medication); toxic epidermic necrolysis (blistering and peeling); dermatomyositis (skin rash caused by a muscle disease), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)  – bleeding into the skin; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); lymphoreticular neoplasms (cancer caused by proliferation of red cells in the lymphs); frostbite; lead poisoning; and pemphigus (an autoimmune disease).
"
"A diagnosis of anemia should be demonstrated by blood tests to help distinguish warm antibody hemolytic anemia (autoimmune disease) from other causes of red blood cell destruction/loss. Macroscopic hemagglutination (clumping of red blood cells) in vitro may lead to rouleaux formation (stacks of red blood cells, as with coin rolls); mimicking erythrocyte agglutination (red blood cell clumping) on a glass slide.

"
"Some strains of the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria are resistant to standard antibiotics. When the organism is resistant to methicillin and other beta-lactam types of antibiotics, they are referred to as methicillin-resistant Staph aureus, or MRSA.
"
"Staphylococcus aureus, also called Staph aureus or S. aureus, is a specific type of bacteria. It is commonly encountered and normally does not cause illness unless a person or pet becomes ill or injured, in which case the bacteria can become opportunistic and cause an infection.
"
"People can be carriers of Staph aureus and may be otherwise perfectly healthy. This is referred to as colonization. Though dogs are not normally colonized with Staph aureus, if your dog is exposed to a person that is colonized or who has an active infection, your dog can become infected or colonized as well.
"
"Dogs kept as pets can become colonized or infected by MRSA organisms through exposure to colonized or infected people. Risk factors that may increase the chance of MRSA infections include previous surgery, hospitalization, and/or antibiotic use. Therapy pets, particularly those used in hospital visitation programs, may also be at increased risk.
"
"When exposed to an MRSA organism, your dog may be colonized, in which case the MRSA bacteria may be present in your dog's nose or anal region. Colonized dogs are considered to be carriers of the disease and are often asymptomatic, appearing perfectly healthy. 
"
"Alternatively, your dog may also become infected, particularly if he has pre-existing wounds. Dog can be both colonized and infected simultaneously under the right circumstances.
"
"Most dog are exposed to MRSA infections through human contact. However, once colonized or infected, your dog can potentially pass the disease to other animals, as well as to people.
"
"Diagnosis is usually accomplished through a bacterial culture. Samples for culture may be collected by swabbing the nose or anal region of a suspected carrier, or by culturing an infected wound directly, if present. By definition, if a Staph aureus organism that is resistant to methicillin is isolated, a diagnosis of MRSA is established. In reality, oxacillin (an antibiotic closely related to methicillin) is the antibiotic used to test for susceptibility. Staph aureus organisms that are resistant to oxacillin are considered to be MRSA.
"
"
"
"For dogs that are colonized with MRSA and are otherwise healthy, treatment is usually not necessary. In most cases, assuming that the dog is not re-exposed to the bacteria, your dog will successfully clear the infection, usually within a few weeks. However, attention to sanitary practices is recommended, including household disinfection.
"
"For dog with MRSA infections, local wound treatment is important and may consist of lancing and draining any abscesses, keeping wounds clean and bandaged, and following any directions provided by your veterinarian. Antibiotics are normally chosen based on testing to determine which medications are most effective in killing the bacteria. Finish all antibiotics prescribed for your dog even if his symptoms seem to be improved before the medication is finished.
"
"If your dog is colonized or infected with a MRSA, there are several things you can do to prevent transmission.
"
"To prevent spread of MRSA infections to your pet, hand hygiene is important. If you or a family member are suffering from an MRSA infection or are colonized, wash your hands thoroughly and often using soap and water. Also, avoid kissing your dog or allowing your dog to kiss you or come into contact with any broken skin.

"
"
"
"Your dog will need to be hospitalized in a warm environment until its health has stabilized and the disease is nonprogressive. Supportive care and wound management depend on clinical signs. If necrosis involving the tail tip or feet is severe, amputation may be required.
"
"Removal of the spleen is of little assistance in patients with IgM-mediated hemolytic disorders, but may be helpful in those with therapy-resistant IgG-mediated hemolytic anemia.
"
"Animals that have suffered from this condition are prone to relapse. Keep your dog in a warm environment at all times to prevent relapse. Prognosis is guarded to fair and recovery may take weeks.

"Anemia is a common clinical problem that shows a decrease in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs are produced in the bone marrow and carry oxygen to all tissues in the body.
"
"Dogs show signs of anemia in various ways, based on its cause, severity, and duration. As anemia worsens, dogs show clinical signs of shock and failing cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
"
"Anemia can be severe and life-threatening. Seek veterinary care immediately if your pet has pale gums, is struggling to breathe, is actively bleeding, or has unusual bruising.
"
"In general, there are three ways that a dog can be anemic:
"
"RBC loss: The bone marrow produces normal amounts of RBCs, but they are lost or leak outside the blood vessels.
"
"RBC destruction: The body destroys the RBCs too soon.
"
"RBC decreased production: The bone marrow does not make enough RBCs.
"
"In addition to these general types, anemia may be described by how responsive the bone marrow is.
"
"In regenerative anemia, the bone marrow correctly responds to the decreased RBC count and starts making new RBCs.
"
"In nonregenerative anemia, the bone marrow does not produce enough RBCs.
"

"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Clinical signs of anemia in dogs vary based on cause, severity, and length of disease. Dogs with chronic conditions may have vague, or no clinical signs until the anemia becomes severe. These dogs can acclimate to lower RBC counts over a longer period, whereas a dog with an acute blood loss may immediately show signs of distress and illness. Common signs of anemia in dogs include:
"
"Weakness
"
"Lethargy
"
"Decreased appetite
"
"Pica (eating non-food items)
"
"Weight loss
"
"Pale mucous membranes (gums)
"
"Increased heart rate
"
"Increased respiratory (breathing) rate
"
"Difficulty breathing
"
"Collapse
"
"Small or large bruising over the body (petechiae and ecchymoses)
"
"Jaundice (buildup of yellow coloring in blood and tissue)
"
"Blood loss from nose, mouth, or urogenital or gastrointestinal systems
"
"Anemia occurs in all breeds, ages, and genders of dogs. Some breeds are predisposed to a certain type of anemia, called Immune-mediated Hemolytic Anemia (IMHA) including:
"
"American Cocker Spaniel
"
"Miniature Schnauzer
"
"Collie
"
"Doberman Pinscher
"
"English Springer Spaniel
"
"Poodle
"
"Bichon Frise
"
"Miniature Pinscher
"
"Old English Sheepdog
"
"Maltese
"
"Blood loss, when acute, occurs secondary to trauma, surgery, coagulopathies (poor clotting), rodenticide toxicity, a ruptured spleen, and bleeding cancers (hemangiosarcoma). Chronic blood loss can also lead to anemia in cases of long-term gastrointestinal ulcers, parasites (hookworms and fleas), tumors, lack of nutrition, and some drugs.
"
"RBC destruction occurs when normal RBCs are removed from the system inappropriately and too early. Normally, RBCs last around 110 to 115 days in dogs and are removed by the spleen, liver, or bone marrow when they are old.
"
"Common examples of this type of anemia are:
"
"IMHA occurs when the immune system attacks the red blood cells. This can happen secondary to a trigger, such as some drugs, infections, cancers, or inflammatory diseases. It can also occur with no clear cause.
"
"RBC parasites, such as babesia, can induce anemia.
"
"Oxidative stress causes anemia and occurs in onion/garlic toxicities, acetaminophen and benzocaine toxicities, and zinc toxicosis, for example. Oxidative stress causes the normal oxygen-carrying hemoglobin to change to methemoglobin, which cannot bind or deliver oxygen to cells.
"
"Mechanical damage can occur to RBCs in heartworm disease, vasculitis, cardiac disease, liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and in some cancers.
"
"Other causes of RBC destruction include some infections, incompatible blood transfusions, genetic RBC abnormalities and disorders, diabetic ketoacidosis, propofol administration, and hypophosphatemia (low phosphorus).
"
"Decreased RBC production occurs when the bone marrow does not make enough RBCs. This type is, inherently, nonregenerative. The following can all affect the body’s ability to produce RBCs:
"
"Chronic inflammatory diseases
"
"Chronic kidney disease
"
"Hypothyroidism
"
"Addison’s disease
"
"Immune conditions
"
"Infection
"
"Cancer
"
"Bone marrow suppression via infectious agents, drugs, and toxicities such as:
"
"Infectious agents—Parvovirus, babesia, ehrlichia
"
"Drugs—Chemotherapy agents, lead, methimazole, phenobarbital, fenbendazole, TMS, albendazole
"
"Often, veterinarians may suspect anemia based on a patient’s history and clinical exam findings—especially if the dog has pale gums, bruising, or obvious abdominal tumors. However, anemia is only diagnosed by performing bloodwork to assess the RBC count as well other RBC factors such as size, shape, and color, which may help find the severity, chronicity, or cause of the anemia.
"
"Complete blood count (CBC): This test looks at multiple RBC factors. These all help the veterinarian to chart the best plan of treatment for anemia.
"
"PCV/TS: This is a relatively easy and quick diagnostic tool to look at the packed cell volume, which is another way to monitor the RBCs.
"
"Reticulocyte count: This test looks for increased numbers of young RBCs, showing a regenerative response.
"
"Biochemistry and urinalysis: These tests will look at organ function and other parameters that may be causing the anemia.
"
"Slide agglutination test: This simple blood test looks for abnormal clumping of RBCs in IMHA.
"
"Cytology or blood smear: This test evaluates RBCs under a microscope and may help find the cause and the bone marrow’s response.
"
"Bone marrow evaluation: This test can help look for causes of anemia by examining the bone marrow for cancer, signs of regeneration, or infectious agents.
"
"Imaging: Radiographs and ultrasound may help look for underlying causes of anemia, such as bleeding tumors.
"
"Other tests: Serology for infectious agents, fecal tests, coagulation profiles, endocrine testing, organ function tests, and biopsy of tumors are all other possible tests for dogs with anemia.
"
"The primary goal for dogs with anemia is to treat the underlying condition. Treatment varies based on chronicity and severity of the disease. Some common treatment methods for anemia include:
"
"Surgery to remove bleeding masses or repair traumatic wounds
"
"Vitamin K therapy to treat rodenticide poisoning
"
"Antiparasitic drugs to treat internal parasites
"
"Antibiotics to treat tick-borne or other infectious agents
"
"Discontinuing offending drugs
"
"Steroids or immunosuppressing medications to treat autoimmune diseases
"
"Blood products to provide RBCs and other important blood cells
"
"Supportive care, including intravenous fluids
"
"Most veterinarians use serial complete blood count and/or PCV/TS testing to watch the dog’s response to treatment, in addition to watching any other diseases potentially causing the anemia. In general, if the underlying disease is treated, anemia may take multiple weeks for the dog to return to normal, but clinical improvement is usually noted within a few days.
"
"These dogs may require life-long medical management and monitoring for recurrence. Some causes of anemia such as trauma, infectious agents, or parasites, may be cured. However, severe cases of anemia may be too progressed to treat, even with aggressive therapy.
"
"Management varies based on the predisposing factor and may be lifelong. Dogs with IMHA are at risk for flare-ups. Care should be taken whenever administering medications or vaccines in those dogs to decrease the risk of a recurrence.

"Arsenic is a heavy metal mineral that is commonly included in chemical compounds for consumer products, such as herbicides (chemicals to kill unwanted plants), insecticides (chemicals to kill insects), wood preservatives, and in some drug formulas for treating blood parasites like heartworm. In parasitic treatment drugs, the level of arsenic is in sub-lethal ranges and will not harm a dog, but over-dosage can lead to toxicity. In most cases, dogs accidentally ingest products containing arsenic when they gain access to such compounds.
"
"In case of acute exposure to arsenic, the following symptoms may be present in an affected dog:
"
"Background history is very important in the diagnosis of arsenic poisoning and your veterinarian will need to know about any arsenic-containing compounds you have at home. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A history of any medications given to your dog lately will also help in diagnosis. Frequently, owners will bring their dogs to the veterinarian with the complaint of a sudden unexplained episode of vomiting. However, few owners report seeing their dogs ingest arsenic-containing compounds so this may not be the first cause that apparent. Your veterinarian will perform a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. A sample of the stomach contents may also be necessary. Arsenic in the blood stream or stomach contents will confirm the diagnosis. In cases of chronic arsenic poisoning the level of arsenic in the body can be evaluated from a hair sample, as arsenic is deposited in the hair over a course of time.
"
"If possible, you should collect a sample of the vomit or diarrhea to take to the veterinarian. This will help to speed the diagnostic process so that your dog can be treated before further damage is done.
"
"
"
"Acute (sudden) arsenic poisoning is an emergency and time remains the crucial factor for a successful outcome. Vomiting plays a protective role in arsenic poisoning as it expels a large portion of the ingested poisonous material. However, if vomiting is not initiated in the immediate aftermath, your veterinarian will need to perform a gastric lavage (stomach irrigation) to wash out the stomach contents. As arsenic severely damages the liver and kidneys, dialysis is conducted for dogs that are in a state of kidney failure due to arsenic poisoning. The main objective of treatment is to flush the poison out of the body; therefore fluid therapy and drugs promoting excretion are commonly employed. Also, some compounds are known to chelate (bind) heavy metals such as arsenic, and are commonly used to bind arsenic that is still present in the body. Chelators work both by slowing the arsenic down before it can cross the blood-brain barrier, and by making it more water-soluble so that it can be washed from the body more effectively. Your veterinarian can employ such antidotes to enhance recovery in your dog. Your dog may need to be admitted into the veterinary hospital for a few days until it has stabilized and is completely out of danger.
"
"Conversely, if you actually witnessed your dog consuming the poison, you  can act quickly by inducing vomiting, but this must be done immediately  following the event. Call your doctor for instructions on how to induce  vomiting safely. If time elapses from the time of ingestion, only a  veterinarian can treat your dog. Because induced vomiting can be  dangerous with some toxins, as some poisons will do more harm coming  back through the esophagus than they did going down, do not induce  vomiting unless you are absolutely sure of what your dog has ingested.  If your dog has already vomited, do not try to force more vomiting.  
"
"A final word, do not induce vomiting if your dog is unconscious, is having trouble breathing, or is exhibiting signs of serious distress or shock. Whether your dog vomits or not, after the initial care, you must take it to a veterinary facility immediately.
"
"After returning from the hospital, allow your dog proper rest and protect it from any source of stress. Follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for home treatment, such as medication and nutrition. Easily digestible food is often recommended for dogs that are recovering from a poisoning.
"
"Ensure that all sources of arsenic-compounds are secured or removed. If they must be kept in the home, be sure that they are out of reach of children and pets. Most problems are easily avoided if guidelines for handling and keeping such poisonous compounds are followed.
"
"Keep an eye on your dog and if you observe anything unusual in its behavior, immediately consult your veterinarian. Unfortunately, in many cases of heavy intoxication, very few patients survive unless treatment is started very early.

"Bone marrow plays a pivotal role in the origination and constant replenishment of important cells like red blood cells (RBCs), granulocytes (or white blood cells [WBCs]), and platelets. Once these cells reach the point of maturation they are released from the marrow into the blood stream. In some mammals, it is estimated that as many as three million red blood cells per second are released into the blood circulation, demonstrating the extensive amount of work done by the bone marrow in keeping the numbers of these cells within normal ranges in the body.
"
"Aplastic anemia in dogs is a diseased condition resulting from the bone marrow's inability to replenish blood cells. Where aplastic refers to the dysfunction of an organ, and anemia refers to a lack of red blood cells. Aplastic anemia is a life-threatening condition resulting when normal bone marrow is replaced by adipose (fat) tissue, thus preventing it from releasing the required number of WBCs, RBCs, and platelets and resulting in an overall decrease in the total number of these cells in the blood. RBCs have several vital functions in the body, including carriage of oxygen and removal of waste carbon dioxide. WBCs are essential for fighting infections and foreign particles, whereas platelets are required for clotting the blood and preventing hemorrhage. All symptoms seen in aplastic anemia directly relate to the functions of these cells. In most cases of aplastic anemia, all three types of cells are affected. If left untreated, this condition can lead to death in severely affected dogs.
"
"All three types of cells affected in this disease have different roles to play in normal body functions, therefore, the symptoms will vary depending on the type of cells mostly affected and the severity of the problem. Following are some of the symptoms related to aplastic anemia.
"
"There are a variety of causes for aplastic anemia, including infections, toxins, drugs, and chemicals which may cause aplastic anemia in dogs. Following are some major causes of aplastic anemia in dogs:
"
"Infections
"
"Drugs and chemicals
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a physical examination with full laboratory testing, including complete blood tests, biochemical profiles, and urinalysis. The results of these tests will provide valuable information for the preliminary diagnosis. The count of various cells will be determined; counts that are far below the normal ranges are considered a positive result.
"
"Your veterinarian will also evaluate your dog for the presence of any infectious diseases, but the most valuable test in the diagnosis of aplastic anemia is bone marrow sampling. In this test a small sample of bone marrow will be collected through aspiration or biopsy. The microscopic studies will reveal the important information related to the architecture of the bone marrow and any developmental problems of the various cells in the bone marrow.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will start treating your dog immediately after a confirmatory diagnosis has been made. Your dog may need to be hospitalized for few days to be monitored and treated. With aplastic anemia, there are number of problems to deal with and supportive therapy will be initiated to provide the required nutrition and energy that your dog is lacking. If required, whole blood transfusions may be recommended for severely anemic patients. As this problem is mediated mostly through the immune system, the primary treatment involves suppressing the immune system with drugs like cyclosporine A. Cyclosporine and other related agents suppress the bone marrow’s over-response. Drugs supporting the bone marrow functions are also recommended for these patients. Antibiotics are given to treat ongoing infections as well as for the prevention of further infections.
"
"During hospitalization, your veterinarian will monitor your dog's status daily. Blood tests will be repeated to determine the current status of the problem. In some dogs, bone marrow sampling may need to be repeated in order to see if the bone marrow is responding normally or not. Unfortunately, with aplastic anemia few patients survive despite extensive care and treatment. Young dogs have a better chance of survival, but even if initial recovery is attained, it may take several weeks to months for a complete recovery.

"L-form bacteria are formed as a spontaneous variant of bacteria with defective or absent cell walls, or when cell wall synthesis is inhibited or impaired by antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), specific immunoglobulins, or lysosomal enzymes that degrade the cell walls. L-form bacteria are defective variations of regular bacterial cells, which can be almost any type of bacteria. L-forms are different from most other forms of bacteria in the respect that cell walls are an important component of organized cell division. While L-forms are still able to divide, creating more of themselves, they lack the same organizational structure as bacteria  with cell walls. L-forms replicate without regard to size, big and small, rather than being of one standard size. They have been found throughout nature, in humans, animals, and plants.
"
"They can be induced from virtually all gram- positive and negative bacteria under suitable conditions. They occur sporadically in dogs.
"
"Bites, scratches, or trauma may 	allow the organism to enter the skin  and subcutaneous tissue. Formation is also encouraged by 	antibiotic  treatment of the host, resistance of the host, 	suitability of the site  for establishment of the infective 	bacterium, and relatively low to  moderate virulence of the infecting 	bacterium.
"
"L-form bacteria are difficult organisms to isolate and identify. Using a  process of differential diagnosis, which is guided by deeper inspection  of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common  causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated  appropriately, the veterinarian will make a diagnosis by putting all of  the signs and symptoms together, along with any consistent laboratory  results, to come to a conclusion. Your doctor will also collect some of  the fluid from any draining  lesions, as well as joint fluid fr analysis.
"
"
"
"Gentle cleaning of the wound will help to degrade the fragile L-form organisms. In most cases, doctors allow the open wounds to heal by secondary intention; that is, the open edges of the wound are not intentionally closed (e.g., by stitches), but are allowed to heal by themselves, growing new tissue over the wound. The main treatment in this case is by cleansing the wound, applying antibiotic ointment to the wound, and applying fresh bandages.
"
"Your veterinarian will prescribe medications such as antibiotics to treat the symptoms as well as the disease; however, these organisms are resistant and difficult to target with antibiotics. The fever usually breaks within 24-48 hours. In many cases, arthritic symptoms continue to persist.

"Anisocoria is a condition in which a dog’s pupils are different sizes. The pupil, a small dark circle at the center of the eye, can adjust its size to let light into the back of the eye to assist in vision.
"
"In low-light conditions, a normal pupil will dilate (get larger) to let in more light, enabling your dog to perceive shadows and get around in dim surroundings. Conversely, in bright sunlight, the pupil will constrict (get smaller), reducing the amount of light hitting the retina so that your dog is able to see clearly.
"
"Normal, healthy pupils are symmetrical and, whether dilating or constricting, they change size simultaneously. When one pupil is notably larger than the other, it is called anisocoria.
"
"The pupil is surrounded by the iris, the colored ring of the eye. It’s the muscles of the iris and the nerves that run through the eye, face, and brain that control how big the pupils are. Several diseases and conditions can impact these nerves and muscles, affecting the ability to constrict and dilate the pupils appropriately. There are also a few conditions that can affect the brain, disrupting the necessary signals required for normal pupil constriction.
"
"While many of these diseases tend to be chronic, if you notice anisocoria occurring suddenly, seek veterinary care as soon as possible. Anisocoria is relatively rare. While it can be harmless, that is not always the case. Sudden onset of anisocoria is considered a medical emergency, especially if it occurs following trauma.
"
"When a disease or trauma disrupts the nerves or muscles controlling pupil size, one pupil can become abnormally dilated or constricted. While lighting plays a role in changing pupil sizes, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are also involved.
"
"The sympathetic nervous system is often referred to as “fight or flight.” It’s the segment of the animal’s nervous system that gets triggered when faced with danger or intense physical activity. When the sympathetic nervous system is activated, the pupils dilate to allow more light into the retinas, enhancing vision. This is why frightened dogs often have dilated pupils. On the other hand, the parasympathetic nervous system is nicknamed the “rest and digest” response. It gets activated during periods of relaxation. When a dog is eating or resting, the parasympathetic nervous system comes into play, causing the pupils to become smaller.
"
"The mechanisms engaged in changing pupil size entail the collaboration of multiple elements: nerves, muscles, the brain, and the retina. If any of the processes in this pathway are disrupted, abnormalities can occur. These abnormalities might manifest on the eye’s surface, within the iris muscles, along the nerves connected to the eye, within the retina, or even within the brain itself.
"
"Anisocoria means that the pupils are unequal sizes, signifying that one pupil is either abnormally dilated or constricted.
"
"There are several clinical signs that can occur with anisocoria in dogs, depending on the underlying cause. In addition to asymmetrical pupil sizes, one or many of the following may be noticed:
"
"Redness of the conjunctiva, the white part of the eyeball
"
"Squinting
"
"Drainage from the eye
"
"Eye discoloration
"
"Drooping of the eyelid or face
"
"Head shaking
"
"Elevated third eyelid
"
"Lethargy or reduced activity level 
"
"Several conditions lead to anisocoria in dogs. While some of these conditions are chronic and relatively benign, others are more serious:
"
"Iris atrophy: This condition involves changes to the iris, the colored part of the dog’s eye. This is more common in senior dogs of small breeds, such as the Chihuahua, Miniature Poodle, and Miniature Schnauzer.
"
"Injury to the cornea: The cornea, the eye’s clear surface, can suffer injuries, often in the form of scratches called corneal ulcers. These ulcers can be very painful, resulting in a reduced pupil size in the affected eye. 
"
"Head trauma: Incidents like being hit by a car, kicked by a large farm animal, or experiencing a fall can cause increased intracranial pressure if the brain is bruised or bleeding. This pressure can subsequently result in anisocoria as it compresses the nerves that enter the eyes.
"
"Glaucoma: Glaucoma is an abnormal increase of pressure inside the eye. It’s a genetic condition that can lead to optic nerve damage, anisocoria, and even blindness.
"
"Cancer: Several cancers can cause uneven pupil sizes. Meningiomas, one of the most common types of brain tumor in dogs, can disrupt the eye’s nerve function, causing changes in pupil size. Also, a tumor developing within the eye can lead to anisocoria.
"
"Horner’s syndrome: This syndrome results in one-sided facial drooping, an elevated third eyelid, and a constricted pupil. It is the result of damage to the sympathetic nervous system, either by disease or injury.
"
"Middle ear infection: When an ear infection becomes deep, inflammation can impact surrounding nerves, leading to a small pupil on the affected side. 
"
"Uveitis: Uveitis is the inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. This inflammation can lead to a range of symptoms and complications, including constriction of the pupil, cloudiness in the eye, squinting, and redness.  Various conditions, including  infections and immune-mediated diseases, can cause uveitis.
"
"Other trauma: Sometimes less obvious forms of trauma, such as the use of choke collars or deep ear flushing, can accidentally cause damage to nerves involved in pupillary constriction, causing changes in pupil size.
"
"Anisocoria is diagnosed through an ophthalmic examination. Your veterinarian will use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope to examine the interior of your dog’s eyes. They will likely shine a bright light into each eye to evaluate the normal pupillary light response, to determine which pupil is normal and which is abnormal, and to see how well they constrict and dilate. They will do a full physical exam before deciding if more tests are necessary.
"
"Your veterinarian will likely also perform several tests on your dog’s eyes. They may stain the cornea with fluorescein dye to detect ulcers, assess the pressure of the eyes, and check tear production. Depending on what they suspect the underlying cause to be, they may recommend blood work or imaging, especially if an underlying systemic disease is suspected. 
"
"The treatment approach depends on the underlying cause and can vary greatly, ranging from no recommended treatment to surgery.
"
"Many conditions that can lead to anisocoria, such as corneal injuries or damage to sympathetic nerves, can be effectively treated. Some conditions, like uveitis and glaucoma, can only be managed long-term, but anisocoria may resolve with appropriate management of the underlying disease.
"
"Other conditions may be untreatable, such as iris atrophy or specific cancers. For iris atrophy, no treatment is necessary, as this is considered a benign change. This contrasts with a brain tumor, where treatment may not be feasible if a decrease in quality of life is likely.
"
"Your veterinarian will discuss recommended treatment options after establishing a diagnosis. Anisocoria is a sign of an underlying condition, not a disease itself. Therefore, the focus is not on treating anisocoria, but rather on addressing the problem that led to the difference in pupil size.
"
"Expectations for recovery are dependent on the underlying cause of anisocoria. If it’s due to iris atrophy in a small-breed senior dog, the prognosis for a normal life is excellent. In cases of an injury affecting nerves or the eye resulting in anisocoria, recovery from the injury should lead to resolution of anisocoria.
"
"Some dogs may require lifelong treatment, such as eye drops, if an underlying eye condition is diagnosed. For instance, glaucoma requires consistent use of eye drops and regular veterinary check-ups to monitor eye pressure for the remainder of a dog’s life.
"
"If your dog loses vision because of their condition, the vision loss is usually permanent. While this is not a common outcome for most underlying causes of anisocoria, it can occur if conditions are left untreated for too long. For this reason, it’s important to consult with your veterinarian right away if you see your dog’s pupils aredifferent sizes.
"
"Temporary anisocoria is when a dog’s pupils are different sizes for a short duration of time and then return to normal. This can happen if there is inflammation inside the eye or inflammation affecting the nerves involved in changing pupil size. If this inflammation subsides quickly and pupils return to their normal size, it is categorized as temporary anisocoria.
"
"Anisocoria can occasionally resolve on its own; however, it’s important to consult with a veterinarian right away to rule out more serious underlying causes, such as trauma.
"
"The term for different-sized pupils in dogs is anisocoria. This condition can stem from various underlying factors, ranging from minor issues to potentially life-threatening ones. If your dog’s pupils are different sizes, it means that either inflammation, compression, or injury has occurred affecting the eye, the nerves connected to the eye, or even the brain.

"Amphetamines are a prescription medication used for a variety of reasons in human medicine. They are used to treat ADD/ADHD and narcolepsy. They are used for weight loss as well. They can also be obtained illicitly (crystal meth, methamphetamine, ecstacy). When ingested by your dog, however, amphetamines can be very toxic.
"
"Amphetamine toxicity can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how it affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"Possible symptoms of amphetamine poisoning in dogs include:
"
"Most cases of amphetamine poisoning in dogs are accidental, caused by the dog ingesting pills that are dropped on the floor. Dogs may also find and ingest medication from pill bottles left on countertops and in other accessible areas. Occasionally, the drug may be given to the dog purposely.
"
"After asking you questions regarding the dog's medical history, your veterinarian will observe the animal for clinical signs consistent with amphetamine ingestion. Blood, urine or stomach contents can be tested for the presence of amphetamines, but it generally takes several days for results to be obtained. Therefore, treatment for amphetamine poisoning must be initiated before these results are returned.
"
"
"
"If ingestion has just occurred and the dog is still ambulatory and not having seizures, vomiting may be induced using apomorphine, hydrogen peroxide, or ipecac. Consult your veterinarian for instructions.
"
"Activated charcoal may be used to adsorb the poison in the stomach. Gastric lavage (“pumping the stomach”) may be necessary as well.
"
"Your veterinarian may administer intravenous fluid therapy in order to dilute the toxicity; he or she may also administer sedatives and/or anticonvulsants to control seizures and reduce stimulation of the nervous system. If the dog’s body temperature rises to dangerous levels, cooling measures may be necessary.
"
"Finally, your veterinarian will want to monitor your dog’s blood chemistry results. Kidney function tests must be closely monitored in dogs poisoned with amphetamines. Additionally, blood pressure and body temperature must be monitored.
"
"Once returned home, a dog that has suffered from amphetamine poisoning must be kept in a calm quiet atmosphere to facilitate recovery.
"
"In order to prevent accidental amphetamine poisoning, keep all prescription medications secured in a location inaccessible to your dog.

"While some consider aggression to be normal behavior in dogs, it can be impulsive, unpredictable, and even dangerous. Aggressive behavior includes growling, lip lifting, barking, snapping, lunging, and biting. With aggression directed towards family members or other people familiar to the dog, treatment is currently aimed at controlling the issue, as there is no known cure.
"
"It can be challenging to determine whether a dog is demonstrating abnormal aggression. Aggression is often exhibited near the dog's food bowl, toys, and times when the dog is being handled. This type of aggression is shown to familiar people, most often their handlers or household members.
"
"Aggression can be seen often and it may not even be towards the same person regularly. Aggression is often displayed as:
"
"While most aggression towards familiar people is a sign of a serious problem, there are some instances where an animal will be aggressive following a painful medical procedure or if they are in pain regularly.
"
"Some breeds are more aggressive than others. These breeds include Spaniels, Terriers, Lhasa Apsos, and Rottweilers, amongst others, but aggression can appear in any breed. Dogs will normally demonstrate signs of aggression between the ages of 12 and 36 months, and is seen more in male than female dogs. Medical conditions and the after-effects of medical procedures can also cause an animal to exhibit aggression towards familiar people. In addition, inconsistent or harsh punishment from the dog's owner can contribute to the animal’s aggression.
"
"During a medical examination, your veterinarian will look for fear-based aggression, anxiety conditions, and pathological disease. Typically, however, a traditional blood test will not find any abnormalities.
"
"
"
"Animals exhibiting aggression towards familiar people require strict behavior modification therapy, and possibly medication. Behavior therapy involves eliminating or controlling situations that may trigger aggression. Veterinarians will help the owner identify the triggers and behaviors, so they can work to correct them. Some dogs will require a muzzle until the behavior is under control. Affection control (working to make the animal obey a command before they receive any treats) is also effective for behavior modification. In addition, desensitization can decrease the animal's responsiveness to anxiety and fear.
"
"In some cases, physical activity can help reduce feelings of aggression in dogs. A low-protein/high-tryptophan diet has had success in reducing aggression. There currently are no approved medications to treat canine aggression, but surgically neutering aggressive male dogs is a common recommendation.
"
"The treatment recommendations given to reduce aggression are designed to be lifelong and should be strictly and consistently followed by the dog's owner. There is currently no cure for aggression.
"
"One of the best preventative measures is to not breed aggressive animals, and to begin socialization and hierarchy training at an early age.

"Amebiasis is a parasitic infection caused by a one celled organism known as an ameba. Amebiasis can affect people as well as dogs and cats. It is found most often in tropical areas and can be seen in North America.
"
"There are two types of parasitic ameba that infect dogs: Entamoeba histolytica and Acanthamoeba.
"
"Entamoeba histolytica:
"
"Acanthamoeba:
"
"Entamoeba histolyticus is most often spread through the ingestion of infected human feces. There are two species of Acanthamoeba that are free-living: A. castellani and A. culbertsoni. These species can be found in freshwater, saltwater, soil and sewage.
"
"Young dogs and those that are immunosuppressed are the most likely to become ill.
"
"Blood testing (complete blood cell count and blood chemistry profile) and urine testing (urinatlysis) are usually performed and are often normal although evidence of dehydration, if present, can be seen in these tests.
"
"Other laboratory tests your veterinarian may recommend include:
"
"
"
"Metronidazole is used to control the symptoms of colitis and is usually successful. However, the systemic forms of the disease (i.e. infections that are spread via the blood stream) are usually fatal despite treatment although symptomatic treatment can be attempted.

"The most common type of anal gland cancer in dogs is called anal gland adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinomas are cancers that start in glands.
"
"The anal glands are scent glands that are positioned on either side of your dog’s anus. Anal glands spray a small amount of a foul-smelling substance when your dog poops. This natural function helps dogs mark their territory. Anal gland secretions are stored in the anal sacs.
"
"Cancer can develop in the apocrine (sweat) glands associated with the anal sac. This cancer usually forms a mass that your vet may be able to feel during a rectal exam.
"

"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"The exact cause of anal gland cancer in dogs is unknown. Anal gland cancer can affect both male and female dogs. It is more commonly found in the following breeds:
"
"German Shepherd
"

"
"Alaskan Malamute
"
"Dachshund
"
"Dogs in the Spaniel family, such as:
"
"English Cocker Spaniel
"
"Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
"
"Springer Spaniel
"
"Symptoms of anal cancer in dogs include:
"
"Discomfort in the area around the anus (perianal region)
"
"Anal discharge
"
"Scooting across the floor
"
"Licking around the perianal area
"
"Straining to poop
"
"Constipation
"
"Anal gland cancer may be hard to detect at home. Instead, a mass in the anal region may be noted during a routine vet examination.
"
"If the tumor is large enough, it may look like swelling in the anal region. It may also interfere with your dog’s ability to defecate, or it may cause ribbon-shaped stool.
"
"In about 25% of anal gland adenocarcinoma cases, dogs will also have an elevated blood calcium level. Elevated calcium in dogs may cause increased thirst and urination, as well as decreased energy level and appetite.
"
"Elevated calcium levels in dogs can be harmful to your animal. If high calcium levels are not medically addressed, your dog is at risk of kidney failure or damage.
"
"Anal gland cancer in dogs is usually diagnosed when your vet feels a mass during a rectal exam or you or your vet notice swelling in the anal region caused by the mass.
"
"To diagnose anal gland cancer in your dog, your vet will collect cells from the mass during a procedure called a fine needle aspirate. During this procedure, a thin needle is inserted into the affected gland and used to collect a small sample of cells. These cells are then examined under a microscope.  
"
"If your vet still suspects cancer after the fine needle aspirate, they will confirm the diagnosis and determine the exact type of cancer. This will require a procedure called a biopsy with histopathology, meaning they will collect more cells and closely examine them. Bloodwork, abdominal ultrasound, and chest x-rays may also be recommended.
"
"The bloodwork looks at the overall health of your dog’s organs, including calcium levels, which may be high due to the cancer.
"
"Chest x-rays can detect cancer that has spread to the lungs or other nearby organs.
"
"An abdominal ultrasound can show if the cancer has spread to internal organs and lymph nodes.
"
"Consultation with a board-certified veterinary oncologist is recommended when anal sac cancer is diagnosed.
"
"When a dog is diagnosed with anal gland cancer, surgical removal of the anal gland and sac are recommended. Removing the tumor can help your dog live longer and can lower elevated calcium levels.  
"
"If the cancer has spread to local lymph nodes, they will also likely be removed with surgery.
"
"If the cancer has already spread to other parts of your dog’s body, surgery to remove the anal gland mass may still be performed to make your dog more comfortable, but it might not prolong their life span.
"
"Chemotherapy is frequently recommended to prevent further spread or recurrence. In cases where surgery is not possible, radiation therapy may be recommended to shrink your dog’s tumor.
"
"If surgery is performed to remove the tumor, and there’s no evidence of metastasis (spread), dogs can live 1-2 years.
"
"Anal gland adenocarcinomas are very aggressive and invade tissues around the tumor. They also have a high rate of metastasis (spread). Anal cancer in dogs can spread to any part of the body but usually spreads to local lymph nodes first.
"
"Anal gland cancer can be curable in rare cases if it’s caught in the very early stages and treated aggressively with surgery plus chemotherapy.

"Glow sticks and glow jewelry are available as bracelets, necklaces and wands. They contain a chemical that glows in the dark and are particularly popular around the July 4 holiday and Halloween. However, when chewed or ingested by your dog, the chemical inside of the sticks and/or jewelry cause an intense reaction to the taste of the chemical.
"
"This adverse reaction associated with glow jewelry can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how it affects cats, please visit this page in the petMD health library.
"
"When dogs bite into or ingest glow jewelry or glow sticks, the chemical dibutyl phthalate causes an intense taste reaction. Symptoms seen include:
"
"Other than the reaction to the bad taste, glow sticks and glow jewelry are generally not toxic.
"
"It is the dibutyl phthalate chemical found in glow sticks and other glow jewelry which may cause adverse reactions in dogs and that dogs find offensive.
"
"In addition to taking the dog's medical history, a veterinarian will observe your dog for signs and symptoms associated with ingesting dibutyl phthalate.
"
"
"
"Generally, no treatment is needed for dogs that ingest glow jewelry. However, providing water or food to diminish the taste of the glow stick/jewelry can be useful in alleviating symptoms. Washing the chemical off of your dog’s fur and skin with shampoo and water is recommended also. Taking your pet into a darkened room can help you locate the chemical on your dog’s fur and skin to aid in removal.
"
"Anaerobic infections are those that involve bacteria that are able to grow best in the absence of free oxygen. Consequently, these bacteria often thrive in the mouth around the gums; in deep wounds, such as those caused by puncture to the skin; in wounds caused by fractured bone, where the bone has broken through to the surface; and in deep bite wounds from other animals. Anaerobic infection should be suspected when a wound is healing very slowly.
"
"Although anaerobes are a normal part of the body's chemical community, living in symbiosis in the abdomen, vaginal canal, intestines and mouth, when something happens to disrupt the balance of bacteria, such as what occurs with surgery, deep injuries or internal infections, these bacteria can invade the dog's tissue, leading to deep infection and tissue death. If left untreated, an anaerobic infection can lead to shock and even death.
"
"Depending on the cause of the anaerobic infection, dogs may display a variety of symptoms. Dogs that have developed an anaerobic bacterial infection because of a wound, for instance, may display bite marks, have pus oozing from the wound, or open fractures (where bone sticks out). Moreover, wounds infected with anaerobic bacteria will be slow to heal. Other common symptoms of anaerobic bacterial infections in dogs include fever, lameness, difficulty eating, and loss of appetite (related to infection of the gums).
"
"There are also several types of bacteria that can lead to infections, including:
"
"The ultimate cause of an anaerobic bacterial infection is the disruption of normal bacterial balance within the dog's body. This can be due to deep injury, trauma, or recent surgical procedures (such as abdominal surgery or when metal implants are placed within the body to support broken bones).
"
"You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as injuries, even slight injuries, fights your dog might have had with another animal, problems eating (which may be related to a mouth infection), and any recent surgeries. Your doctor will need to rule out other causes before making a confirmation of anaerobic infection.
"
"Standard tests include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis, any of which may show a higher than normal white blood cell count, or evidence of a systemic infection. Your veterinarian will be taking samples of any pus along with the tissue (skin/muscle) around the wound to be laboratory cultured (grown) without oxygen. If there is growth, this may be taken as a confirmation that anaerobic bacteria are present.
"
"
"
"Your veterinarian will put your dog on long-term antibiotics. While it can be frustrating to give your dog pills for weeks, it is essential to do so for the entire course, even after the symptoms have passed and your dog appears to be better. If even a small amount of the infection remains, it can return worse than before. For especially reluctant dogs, many of them will eat pills that have been hidden in a small amount of human food. If you use this method to give antibiotics to your pet, always be sure that the dog has eaten and swallowed the entire bite of food and that it is not spitting it out in a hidden place (behind a couch, etc.).
"
"Specific treatment will be dependent on whether the infection is in an easily reachable location. If the infection is in the muscles (of the legs, back, rump, neck, etc.) the veterinarian will open the wound, clean out the dead tissue and expose the tissue to oxygen. If the anaerobic infection is within the body, such as an infected uterus, inside the bones, or in the abdomen, then the veterinarian will have to anesthetize the dog to surgically open and clean and/or drain the wounds.
"
"The best way to prevent accidental ingestion is to keep glow sticks and glow jewelry out of your dog's reach.

"
"These infections are often long-lasting and require long-term antibiotics and monitoring by a veterinarian. It is important to give the antibiotics to your dog on time and as your veterinarian has instructed. If there is bandaging, have your veterinarian go over cleaning and redressing procedures, to ensure that the wound is able to heal. You may need to use am Elizabethan collar, or cone, to keep your dog from getting to the wound.
"
"Be sure to take your dog back for regular follow-up appointments so that wounds may be reopened and cleansed if necessary. Biochemical profiles will also be repeated at follow-up veterinary visits to check on the status of the infection.
"
"In-between visits, you should call your veterinarian if you notice any changes in your dog's behavior. If the dog seems very tired, has no appetite, or has any redness, swelling or pus at the site of the wound, for example, be sure to consult your veterinarian immediately.
"
"During the healing process, you may need to avoid certain activities, such as swimming, or you may need to limit your dog's outdoor time, to prevent the infected site from getting dirty.

"Adrenal glands are two small glands in your dog’s abdomen, just in front of the kidneys, and any part of these glands can develop tumors. Not all adrenal tumors are cancer. Some are benign, or noncancerous. Benign tumors within the adrenal glands may still be hormonally active, causing various symptoms.
"
"A dog’s adrenal glands are crucial in regulating heart rate, blood sugar, blood pressure, and secretion of hormones during physical and emotional stress. The glands are divided into two parts: the outer area, called the cortex, and the middle area, the medulla.
"
"The cortex is divided into three layers and secretes the following steroid hormones: 
"
"Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone), which help control sodium and potassium electrolytes
"
"Glucocorticoids (such as cortisol), which have a role in metabolism, reducing inflammation, and helping the immune system
"
"Infectious canine hepatitis is a viral disease of that is caused by the canine adenovirus CAV-1, a type of DNA virus that causes upper respiratory tract infections. This virus targets the parenchymal (functional) parts of the organs, notably the liver, kidneys, eyes and endothelial cells (the cells that line the interior surface of the blood vessels).
"
"The virus begins by localizing in the tonsils around 4 to 8 days after nose and mouth exposure. It then spreads into the bloodstream -- a condition know as viremia (in the blood stream) -- and localizes in the Kupffer cells (specialized white blood cells located in the liver) and endothelium of the liver. Ideally, these white cells, called macrophages, defend the body against infectious invaders, but some viruses  have the ability to macropahages as vehicles for replication and spread. CAV-1 is one such virus, taking advantage of the Kupffer cells to replicate and spread, in the process damaging the adjacent hepatocytes (liver cells that are involved in protein synthesis and storage, and transformation of carbohydrates). During this stage of the infection, the virus is shed into the feces and saliva, making both infectious to other dogs.
"
"In a healthy dog with an adequate antibody response, the viral cells will clear the organs in 10 to 14 days, but will remain localized in the kidneys, where the virus will continue to be shed in the urine for 6 to 9 months.
"
"In dogs with only partial neutralizing antibody response, chronic hepatitis takes place. This severe condition often results in cytotoxic ocular injury due to inflammation and death of the cells in the eye with inflammation of the front of the eye (anterior uveitis). This condition leads to one of the more outwardly visible and  classic signs of infectious hepatitis: “hepatitis blue eye.”
"
"There are no breed, genetic, or gender associations for acquiring the CAV-1 virus, but  but it is primarily seen in dogs that are less than one year of age.
"
"Symptoms will depend on the immunologic status of the host and degree of initial injury to the cells (cytotoxic):
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, previous illnesses, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Contact with other dogs, such as in kennels, or frequency of contact with feces, such as in open spaces where dogs are permitted to defecate, may play a role in acquiring this virus.
"
"Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, with standard laboratory work. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Other laboratory work that will need to be done to confirm a diagnosis of infectious hepatitis include coagulation tests to check for the clotting function of the blood, serology for antibodies to CAV-1, viral isolation of the virus cells, and viral culture. Your doctor will be checking for other common diseases as well, including parvovirus and distemper.
"
"Imaging techniques will include an abdominal radiography to look for enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and fluid buildup in the abdominal cavity, and abdominal ultrasonography, which can give a more detailed view of the liver and whether it is enlarged of is suffering from necrosis (cell death). The latter technique is especially necessary if there is abdominal swelling, as the radiography will show a reduced image detail if there is fluid blocking the view to the liver, where ultrasound imaging will return information based on the depth of frequency of the echo, based on the structure of the tissues. That is, cellular/tissue death in the liver will show decreased echo (hypoechoeic), and severe fluid build up in the abdomen will not return any echoes (anechoic).
"
"A liver biopsy may also need to be performed to make a conclusive diagnosis.
"
"
"
"Sex hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone
"
"The medulla secretes catecholamines, which are important hormones during stress and fight-or-flight responses. In addition, the medulla releases epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine.
"
"The most common disease caused by adrenal tumors is adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing’s disease. Dogs with Cushing’s disease most notably have excessive thirst, urination, and appetite. Cushing’s is very common in dogs, but most acquire the disease from dysfunction within their pituitary gland, not the adrenals. Only around 20% of dogs with Cushing’s disease have an adrenal tumor.
"
"Other rare tumors of the adrenal glands may secrete aldosterone and cause a disorder called hyperaldosteronism, which may cause weakness and lethargy. More serious rare adrenal gland tumors can invade major vessels in the body and cause arrhythmias and clots while severely increasing blood pressure.
"
"The most common adrenal tumors in dogs are:
"
"Adrenal adenoma: A tumor that may be functional (secrete hormones) or nonfunctional (does not secrete hormones). Adenomas commonly secrete cortisol, causing Cushing’s disease, or aldosterone, causing hyperaldosteronism.
"
"Adrenal carcinoma: a tumor that is malignant and can also secrete cortisol or aldosterone, causing Cushing’s disease or hyperaldosteronism. These metastasize, or spread, in up to 50% of cases. Metastasis sites are usually the liver and the lungs.
"
"Pheochromocytoma: A rare tumor in the medulla that secretes epinephrine, norepinephrine, or both.
"
"Paraganglioma: A rare tumor coming from the nerves that can secrete catecholamines.
"
"Most adrenal gland tumors occur in middle-aged to older dogs, but there are no breed predispositions. Larger dogs may be at higher risk of functional tumors secreting cortisol, causing Cushing’s disease.
"
"Symptoms of adrenal gland tumors in dogs vary, based on the type of tumor. Most commonly, tumors secrete cortisol, which is a steroid. Overproduction of steroids leads to:
"
"Increased thirst
"
"Increased urination
"
"Increased hunger
"
"Weight gain
"
"Pot-belly appearance
"
"Skin issues
"
"Urinary tract infections
"
"Hair loss
"
"More serious tumors, called pheochromocytomas, secrete fight-or-flight hormones like adrenaline. These symptoms may be vague, and wax and wane. At times, the dog may even seem normal, but these types of tumors have profound cardiac and other manifestations, such as:
"
"Abnormal heart rate and rhythm leading to weakness and collapse
"
"Increased blood pressure leading to behavior changes or blindness
"
"Increased thirst and urination
"
"Weight loss and decreased appetite
"
"Seizures
"
"Panting
"
"If the infection is in the very early stage and is uncomplicated, treatment may be given on an outpatient basis. However, treatment is usually given inpatient. Fluid therapy will be given for electrolyte imbalances that result from vomiting and diarrhea. Potassium and magnesium are often very low and need to be supplement immediately. Blood component therapy will be given for coagulopathy (disorders in the blood's ability to clot). With overt DIC, fresh blood products and low molecular weight heparin will need to be sued to stabilize your dog's condition.
"
"Nutritional support will include giving frequent small meals as tolerated, optimizing nitrogen intake, and feeding the dog according to protein needs. The amount of protein will depend entirely on your dog's individual condition, as some dogs will have high protein in the body and some will have low. Inappropriate protein restriction may impair tissue repair and regeneration. Nitrogen will be restricted if your dog is showing obvious signs of hepatic encephalopathy (a neuropsychiatric abnormality that causes inflammation of the brain and is related to liver failure).
"
"Partial intravenous nutrition will be given for a maximum of five days, or preferably, total intravenous nutrition if oral feeding is not tolerated by the dog. Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics and/or fluid reducers as necessary.
"
"The veterinarian will schedule follow up visits to monitor fluid, electrolyte, acid-base, and coagulation status, and to adjust supportive measures. Sudden kidney failure will also need to be monitored for. A highly digestible diet will need to be fed to your dog during recovery, and a safe place set aside to rest and recover from the illness. Restrict your dog's activity during the recovery period, as well as access to other pets. be especially mindful about cleaning up after your dog, as the virus can continue to be shed long after the recovery period.

"Prevention of this infection requires a a modified live virus vaccination for this disease at six to eight weeks of age. The initial vaccination is followed by two booster shots given at three to four weeks apart until the dog reaches 16 weeks of age, with an additional booster given at one year. This is a highly effective vaccine.

"Causes of adrenal gland tumors are mostly unknown. However, there may be a genetic predisposition to adrenal tumors and environmental, diet, or medication factors that make certain animals more prone to develop them. More studies and research are needed to better understand the cause of these diseases.
"
"Most adrenal gland tumors are found with an ultrasound, which can assess size, shape, and structure. However, while ultrasound can confirm the presence of a tumor in the adrenals, it can only lead veterinarians to an educated guess about the type.
"
"Benign adenomas are typically small and noninvasive. Carcinomas are usually bigger and can invade the surrounding tissue. Tumors typically only affect one, not both, adrenal glands. A biopsy is required for a definitive diagnosis, although not all dogs are candidates for this procedure.
"
"Based on the clinical signs and severity of the disease, other important tests to diagnose adrenal tumors include:
"
"Routine blood chemistry and complete blood count
"
"Blood pressure measurements
"
"X-rays of the chest and abdomen to evaluate for cancerous spread
"
"Cardiac consultation to rule out heart failure
"
"Advanced imaging to determine the extent of invasive tumors
"
"Hormone testing
"
"Endocrine testing, such as an ACTH Stimulation test or Low-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test
"
"Removal of the affected adrenal gland (adrenalectomy) is the treatment of choice. However, surgery may not be an option if the tumor has invaded major blood vessels or other organs or spread to distant sites (metastasis). An adrenalectomy is a serious surgery and should be performed by a surgical specialist at a 24-hour facility, as complications during and after surgery are common.
"
"For dogs who are not candidates for surgery, medical management may be beneficial for a period of time. However, fatal complications, such as blood clots and arrhythmias, may occur at any time.
"
"Dogs with adrenal-dependent Cushing's disease may improve clinically on the drugs mitotane or trilostane, which work to suppress cortisol.
"
"Dogs with nonresectable pheochromocytomas may benefit from drugs to treat their clinical signs, such as blood pressure or cardiac arrhythmias.
"
"Dogs with nonresectable adrenal tumors secreting aldosterone may benefit from drugs like spirinolactone that help block the receptors for aldosterone.
"
"Supportive care may be required during acute crises. Many dogs need to stay in a veterinary hospital on IV fluids, medications, and supplements.
"
"Dogs with benign, nonfunctional tumors have the best prognosis, followed by dogs with benign, functional tumors. Hyperaldosteronism is rare, and the prognosis is usually uncertain.
"
"Cushing’s disease, caused by a benign tumor, is commonly well-managed by surgery or medications followed by periodic exams and testing. Prognosis is good for these animals if symptoms are controlled.
"
"Dogs with malignant tumors causing Cushing’s disease have a worse prognosis, with relatively high metastatic rates. Some of these dogs may live for a few years after diagnosis and adrenal removal, and just over a year if managed with medication alone.
"
"Dogs with pheochromocytomas have a guarded to poor prognosis, as these are typically invasive and metastatic, with many severe side effects causing a poor quality of life. About 20-30% of dogs may not survive the surgery to remove the tumor. Dogs that do survive surgery have an average survival of around 1 year, with less than 60% surviving longer than 3 years. Survival time decreases as the tumor size increases.
"
"Tumors themselves likely do not cause dogs pain. However, secondary complications of tumors may cause them discomfort and a decreased quality of life.
"
"Some tumors are life-threatening; the majority are less serious but still require medical attention and treatment.
"
"Depending on the type and treatment, dogs with adrenal cancer may live for months to years.

"An abscess is a pocket of inflammation that typically has a “wall” of tissue surrounding it. The center is filled with either thick liquid or solid material consisting of white blood cells, dead tissue, and sometimes bacteria.  
"
"There are four common locations for abscesses in dogs. 
"
"Teeth: In a dental abscess, there is infection involving the root of a tooth. The bony socket surrounding the affected root is usually eaten away by the infection, and the surrounding gum is inflamed. 
"
"Skin: Trauma from a bite, a splinter, or something sharp your dog has stepped on can insert bacteria and other foreign debris under the skin. As the wound heals, it may seal up quickly, trapping bacteria and/or debris and leading to the formation of a fluid-filled, inflamed, painful lump.  
"
"A hot spot (acute moist dermatitis) is a type of abscess that forms on the surface of the skin, commonly because of skin allergies. The area becomes itchy, and the dog traumatizes it by chewing or licking excessively. The skin can become infected with bacteria and/or yeast. 
"
"Anal sac: There are internal sacs on either side of the anus that normally contain a fluid that is emptied when a dog has a bowel movement. If the liquid substance becomes too thick to drain properly, the anal sac is never emptied. The fluid continues to accumulate, and the sac becomes inflamed. 
"
"Infected neoplastic mass: A cancerous mass can become abscessed if it outgrows its blood supply. Sometimes the mass will be unchanged for an extended period, then suddenly become painful and inflamed. 
"

"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Depending on the site of the abscess, a dog may exhibit different signs: 
"
"Dental abscesses are painful and may also be associated with an odor or drool (sometimes blood-tinged). A dog with a dental abscess may not be eating normally and may prefer soft food over hard food or treats. Avid chewers may stop chewing toys and bones they once enjoyed. There may also be facial swelling in the region of the affected tooth.   
"
"The immune system serves an important role in protecting your dog from infections and other microscopic threats; however, it can often be overstimulated and result in hypersensitivities or allergies.
"
"Hypersensitivities can be mild or severe and can be local or involve the entire body (systemic). Severe, systemic hypersensitivities are commonly referred to as anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock.
"
"Though rare, if anaphylaxis occurs in a dog, it is a medical emergency. If you think your dog is experiencing anaphylaxis, contact your nearest emergency veterinary office.
"
"Health Tools
"
"
"
"Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
"
"Anaphylaxis occurs because of the inappropriate release of certain infection-fighting compounds by white blood cells. The most common compound released is histamine. In smaller doses histamine causes hives and itching, but when released in large amounts it dilates blood vessels, increases heart rate, and causes low blood pressure.
"
"In most species, anaphylaxis primarily affects the lungs and airways; however, in dogs the gastrointestinal tract often releases histamine directly into the liver, causing symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea as well as liver enzyme elevations to be more commonly seen.
"
"Severe vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy may occur suddenly and appear to come out of nowhere. If allowed to progress, this can lead to collapse, convulsions, and even death.
"
"Other symptoms of anaphylaxis in dogs include facial swelling, itching, and hives, which may or may not progress to difficulty in breathing. Though these effects are more likely to occur in less severe cases of hypersensitivity, they still warrant prompt evaluation by a veterinarian.
"
"In theory, any foreign molecule can trigger an anaphylactic reaction, though a dog must have been exposed to this trigger at least twice before shock can occur.
"
"Most canine reactions are to insect bites or stings (commonly bees, wasps, and venomous ants), medications, antigens in vaccines, or chemicals. Anaphylaxis related to food proteins is very rare, though it has been documented.
"
"Diagnosis of anaphylactic shock is usually based on clinical signs, physical exam, and history of exposure to an allergen (if the allergy is known).
"
"Skin abscesses are painful, warm, soft, or firm lumps. If the abscess is on a paw or leg, you may notice your dog limping. Your dog may cry out or wince if you touch the abscess site. 
"
"Anal sac abscess pain may result in a dog licking excessively under the tail, scooting on the floor, or straining to have a bowel movement. If the anal sac has ruptured through the skin, you may notice drainage from the site. 
"
"Dental abscesses 
"
"Dental disease—tartar accumulation and gingival inflammation 
"
"Fractured (broken) tooth, with bacteria invading the pulp cavity 
"
"Foreign material stuck in the mouth, such as bone pieces, sticks, metal, plant material, hair 
"
"Skin abscesses  
"
"Any type of penetrating trauma, such as bite wounds or stepping on a foreign object 
"
"Excessive licking or chewing due to skin allergies 
"
"Anal sac abscesses 
"
"Thick anal sac material blocking the duct (tube) through which the anal sac empties 
"
"Abscesses are typically identified during a physical exam. If a firm lump is found, your vet may perform a fine needle aspirate, which involves inserting a needle into the mass to collect cells. The sample is then evaluated under a microscope to determine what type of cells are present. Abscess samples contain a lot of white blood cells, and bacteria or fungal organisms may be seen.  
"
"If an abscess does not respond to initial treatment, fluid or material from the site can be put in the incubator to culture (grow) the bacteria involved. Then, antibiotics are tested to see which will be most effective. Bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics can be found in dogs, just as in humans. 
"
"There are multiple treatment options a veterinarian may recommend depending on the dog’s diagnosis. One option includes opening and draining the site and removing the source of infection. This may involve extraction of an abscessed tooth, removal of foreign material stuck under the skin, or flushing the anal sac duct to re-open it.  
"
"Simple skin abscesses may be addressed under local anesthesia, depending on the location. Complicated sites (especially the face) or involved cases (such as dental or large abscesses) will be addressed under general anesthesia. For cleaning hot spots, trimming away the hair can often be done without any form of anesthesia. There are some hot spots, however, that are very painful, and the dog may benefit from sedation for clipping/cleaning of the site. 
"
"Often, oral antibiotics are administered to a dog with an abscess. Pain medication, including an anti-inflammatory medication, is also important. Also, warm compresses applied to a painful, inflamed site help to enhance blood flow and clean the area. This is frequently recommended for the pet parent to do at home for several days. 
"
"Usually, once the cause of the abscess is addressed and the dog is on appropriate treatment, an abscess starts to resolve quickly, within 2-3 days. The dog should start feeling better quickly as well.
"
"Your vet will likely want to recheck your dog a week or two into treatment to see how the abscess site looks. For long-term management, your vet will make recommendations regarding future dental care (for a dental abscess), routine anal sac expression (for an anal sac abscess), and skin allergy management (for hot spots).  
"
"External abscesses are not usually fatal. Internal abscesses, such as inside the chest or abdomen, are more likely to be.
"
"External abscesses do not usually need to be seen on emergency basis.
"
"Small skin abscesses may break open, drain, and heal on their own. However, it is best to have a vet look to see if there is a possible underlying cause that needs to be addressed.
"
"An abscess may get larger over time, but it does not usually spread to another area of the body.
"
"Yes.
"
"Blood tests may help confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating dehydration or liver enzyme elevations, though these tests can also be normal. Inflammation of the liver and gallbladder may be seen on an abdominal ultrasound. 
"
"Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency, and immediate attention is essential to survival. Your vet will use a combination of medications to reduce the immune response and counteract the symptoms. Epinephrine and corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are commonly used for this purpose.
"
"If a dog has progressed to anaphylactic shock, intravenous fluids may be needed to maintain blood pressure. Severe airway swelling may require a breathing tube, sedation, and even ventilation to ensure your pet can breathe. 
"
"Prognosis will depend on the severity of the reaction and how quickly care is managed. Mild cases may respond to treatment without hospitalization, while aggressively treated animals may still succumb to a particularly severe reaction.
"
"Histamine released in the system works rapidly and if the effects of this compound aren’t counteracted by medications and support very quickly, the decreased blood pressure can give the body further signals to shut down, and these are harder to combat. In the hospital, severely affected patients are usually observed and treated for at least 2-3 days to make sure that no delayed effects are noted.
"
"Anaphylactic and allergic reactions worsen with repeat exposures, so allergy testing may be worthwhile in recovered dogs who experienced severe symptoms. Avoidance of the allergen, if possible, is best. For allergens that are difficult to avoid, discuss an emergency plan with your veterinarian. This may include medications such as steroids or an Epi-pen that can be kept at home for immediate use.

"Pneumothorax is the medical term for an accumulation of air in the pleural space, the area between the chest wall and the lungs. It may be categorized as traumatic or spontaneous, and closed or open.
"
"Both dogs and cats are susceptible to pneumothorax. Large, deep-chested dogs, such as the Siberian Husky, are believed to be more susceptible to spontaneous pneumothorax.
"
"If you would like to learn how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
"
"There are four main categories of pneumothorax: traumatic, spontaneous, closed, and open. Symptoms vary depending on the type of pneumothorax, though some common signs include rapid breathing (tachypnea), difficulty breathing (dyspnea), shallow rapid breathing from the abdomen, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia).
"
"Traumatic pneumothorax, which occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and is due to some sort of trauma, such as a car accident, may be evident by the signs of shock.
"
"Dogs with spontaneous pneumothorax, on the other hand, may show sings of lung disease. Spontaneous pneumothorax is due to a non-traumatic cause, and may be primary (meaning it occurs in the absence of some underlying lung disease) or secondary (meaning it is associated with some type of underlying lung disease).
"
"Open pneumothorax occurs when there is a defect located in the respiratory system, such as a puncture in the chest wall, resulting in contact between the pleural space and the outside atmosphere; closed pneumothorax, meanwhile, is identified as pneumothorax without any respiratory defects.
"
"Traumatic pneumothorax is generally open, while spontaneous pneumothorax is always closed.
"
"Another type of pneumothorax is tension pneumothorax, in which air is transferred into the pleural space during regular inhalation, becoming trapped, and creating a one-way transfer of air into the pleural space.
"
"Causes vary depending on the type of pneumothorax. Traumatic pneumothorax may be due to a traumatic incident, such as a car accident, leading to penetrating injuries of the neck or chest. A surgical incision to the chest, or perforation of the esophagus during surgery may also lead to traumatic pneumothorax.
"
"Spontaneous pneumothorax, meanwhile, may be caused by a foreign body in the lung, lung cancer or abscess, lung disease caused by parasites, or the development of blister-like structures in the dog's lungs, known as pulmonary bullae.
"
"Two primary diagnostic procedures may be done in cases of suspected pneumothorax: thoracocentesis and bronchoscopy. Thoracocentesis, in which an intravenous (IV) catheter attached to an extension is inserted into the pleural cavity, can confirm diagnosis, and can also be used to remove air from the pleural space. Bronchoscopy involves the use of a thin tube with a tiny camera attached to it, inserted into the airways by way of the mouth. This is best done if there is evidence of tracheal or large airway trauma.
"
"Additional diagnostic techniques may include X-ray imaging of the chest, and urine analysis.
"
"
"
"Dogs with pneumothorax should be treated in hospital until the accumulation of air in the pleural cavity has stopped or stabilized. As much air as possible should be removed from the pleural space, and oxygen therapy provided until your pet has stabilized. Air removal can be performed via thoracocentesis, in which an intravenous (IV) catheter attached to an extension is inserted into the pleural cavity.
"
"In cases of traumatic open pneumothorax, the open wounds in the dog's chest should be cleaned and covered with an airtight bandage as soon as possible, and later surgically repaired. The administration of intravenous (IV) fluids is also often necessary in cases of trauma.
"
"After initial treatment, the dog's activity should be severely restricted for at least one week to minimize the odds of recurrence. Vital signs, including respiratory rate and pulse, should be monitored for symptoms of recurrence.
"
"Further care depends on the type of pneumothorax affecting your dog, and the severity of its health. Your veterinarian will advise you on how to provide aftercare to your dog until the follow-up exam.
"
"One key way to prevent traumatic pneumothorax is to keep dogs confined and away from dangerous areas such as roads, where they are most likely to be injured.

"Vesicourachal diverticula is congenital condition in which the urachus -- embryological canal or tube connecting the placenta with urinary bladder of fetus -- fails to close. This impairs the animal's normal urine outflow and makes it susceptible to urinary tract infections. If not treated properly, the condition may persist indefinitely.
"
"Often, vesicouracahal deiverticula occurs in the womb or during the birthing process. However, there is also an acquired form of the condition, which results from diseases that put undue pressure on the bladder (e.g., bacterial urinary tract infections, uroliths, and urethral plugs). There is no breed or age predisposition for vesicouracahal deiverticula.
"
"You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which help identify the underlying cause of the condition and the present of concurrent disorders.
"
"The best tool for confirming diagnosis, however, is X-rays of the urethra and bladder while using contrast medium.
"
"
"
"The course of treatment will ultimately depend on the underlying cause of vesicourachal diverticula. Dogs that do not respond to conventional treatment may require surgery to correct the defect.
"
"You will need to visit the veterinarian for regular follow-up exams, where he or she will take urine samples to evaluate the status of infection. Some animals will require long-term antibiotic therapy to combat urinary tract infections. However, overall prognosis in dogs with vesicourachal diverticula is good after treatment.

"There are numerous reasons for why pet owners would like to prevent pregnancy in their pets.
"
"There are numerous reasons for why pet owners would like to prevent pregnancy in their pets. It is a common concern, and there are ways to perform a safe pregnancy termination if your dog has become pregnant. If you are considering ending a pregnancy in your dog, it is recommended that you first seek the advice and assistance of a medical professional, so that a full risk and side effects evaluation can be done.
"
"On the other hand, it is also important to note that dogs can experience spontaneous abortions or miscarriages for a variety of medical reasons. Both situations will be covered here.
"
"If your dog has experienced a spontaneous abortion, the most common thing you may notice is abnormal vaginal bleeding; in some cases an expelled fetus may be found. The most common cause of a spontaneous abortion is fetal death due to a hormonal imbalance.
"
"In the case of a planned abortion, bleeding is the most common symptom following the procedure. It is advised that you closely monitor your dog so that any side effects or health related issues can be responded to quickly.
"
"An ultrasound machine can detect a pregnancy in a dog. In addition, the ultrasound of a fetus is usually necessary before many health care providers will agree to a medical abortion. Doppler-type instruments can also be used to hear a fetus' heartbeat if the pregnancy is far enough along.
"
"
"
"For owners who are looking for safe options to either prevent an unwanted pregnancy or terminate a possible pregnancy, there are several medical alternatives to consider. To permanently prevent pregnancy in dogs, spaying (ovariohysterectomy) is the best option. For pregnancy termination, these are the most common medical options:
"
"Injectable Estrogens- A medical professional can administer these to prevent a pregnancy. The estrogen must be injected shortly following copulation to be effective. However, there are several potential side effects to take into consideration, including bone marrow suppression and pyometra (i.e., infection of the uterus).
"
"Oral Estrogens - These are not recommended because they are ineffective and may cause pyometra in animals.
"
"Prostaglandin F2 alpha - This is a natural hormone that has shown to induce a safe abortion for pets when monitored by a health professional. Most side effects are often mild, if present at all. Some of the drug's known side effects include panting, trembling, nausea and diarrhea.
"
"Dexamethasone - This is also a viable option to induce an abortion for pets. The injection is usually followed by such side effects as panting, excessive drinking (polydispia) and urination (polyuria).
"
"It is important to note that despite the myths surrounding the method, postcoital douches do not effectively terminate an unwanted pregnancy in pets. Following both a planned and spontaneous abortion, there can be a great deal of discomfort and/or some vaginal bleeding or abnormal discharge. Pet owners should carefully observe the behavior of their animals to ensure more serious problems do not develop as a result.

"Dog tails can sometimes seem to have a mind of their own. They act as extensions of canine emotions and tools for communication. Bumps and wounds are more obvious signs of injury, but if your dog has stopped wagging their tail, this is also usually a sign of an underlying problem/issue.
"
"Here’s some information on dog tail anatomy, signs to watch for, and common tail issues.
"
"A dog’s tail is part of the spinal column. It contains multiple vertebral segments (bones) that progress from larger to smaller from the base of the tail toward the tip. The vertebrae are surrounded by muscles that hold the tail up and allow it to move or wag. There are also multiple nerves along the tail that give it feeling.
"
"Specialized structures called intervertebral discs act as cushioning between each vertebrae, preventing the bones from rubbing together when your dog’s tail is moving.
"
"An injury to any part of the tail—the skin, vertebrae, muscles, nerves, or intervertebral discs—can cause a dog that usually wags their tail to stop. 
"
"Signs of dog tail injury include:
"
"Wounds such as lacerations, degloving (when skin is stripped from the underlying muscle), or abrasions
"
"Less or no tail wagging
"
"Holding the tail low
"
"Limp tail
"
"Pain when touched
"
"Swelling
"
"Kink/bump/deviation in the tail
"
"Chewing at the tail or hind end
"
"There are many types of dog tail injuries. It is important to determine the exact location and type of tail injury to develop a treatment plan, if needed. Your veterinary team can help determine the underlying cause and come up with an appropriate approach.
"
"These are some of the more common dog tail injuries.
"
"“Happy tail” is a condition in which dogs repeatedly hit their tails against something firm such as walls, tables, chairs, etc. This eventually causes a superficial or deep wound on the tail. These injuries are often painful, especially since it’s happening repeatedly, which may cause a chronic wound that requires medical management. 
"
"Your veterinarian will often treat a happy tail injury with bandaging to protect the wound, Elizabethan collars to avoid licking/chewing, and sometimes pain medication and antibiotics. The bandaging allows time for the wound to heal and protects your dog’s tail as they continue to wag it and bang it against objects. 
"
"Severe or chronic happy tail issues that don’t heal may require surgical amputation of the lower tail to avoid further infection, pain, and continued injury.
"
"Limp tail (also known as swimmer’s tail or limber tail) is characterized by a suddenly flaccid tail. It’s often  seen in working dogs. A limp tail may droop completely between your dog’s legs, or it may be that only the tip droops and the rest of the tail is lifted.
"
"This condition is caused by tail muscle straining. It’s thought to be the result of overuse of the tail, whether it’s from wagging the tail in happiness, intense activity, and/or prolonged time in a small cage/crate. 
"
"Signs of a limp tail can include chewing at the tail base, swelling of the tail, pain when sitting, trouble standing, and/or pain when trying to move the tail. Limp tail is diagnosed by asking about your dog’s activities, doing a physical examination, and sometimes taking x-rays to rule out fractures. 
"
"Limp tail is usually treated with rest and anti-inflammatory medications for full healing, but relapse is possible.
"
"Tail biting or chewing can lead to wounds, swelling, and hair loss. A dog will usually chew their tail because of pain, stress, itchiness, and/or a “pins and needles” sensation, which can have a neurologic cause.
"
"If you see hair loss along with itchiness, then your dog should be evaluated by your veterinarian for allergies. All types of allergies—genetic, environmental, flea-based, or food-based—can cause itchiness and bald spots along the tail. 
"
"A specific condition called “stud tail” can also cause itching and chewing. This is a condition where an oil-producing skin gland in the middle of a dog’s tail produces too much sebum. Sebum is an oily substance that naturally lubricates your dog’s skin. Overproduction of sebum causes irritation and discomfort.
"
"This condition is often seen in male intact dogs (not neutered) since their hormones encourage more sebum production. Neutering, topical medications and shampoos, and sometimes antibiotics are used to help treat stud tail. 
"
"Hot spots, otherwise known as moist dermatitis, can also occur on your dog’s tail. Hot spots are usually caused by allergies, any area of discomfort, or insect bites.
"
"This causes microscopic inflammation in the skin cells and leads your dog to lick and chew the affected area. The licking and chewing causes hair loss and infection. Hot spots can be small or very large if the licking goes on.
"
"Treatment of hot spots usually includes clipping the fur around the area, cleaning with antiseptic solutions, topical medications, antibiotics, anti-itch medications, pain medications, and an Elizabethan collar. Hot spots often recur due to underlying allergies and may require more intensive testing to determine the cause.
"
"Anal gland issues in dogs and intestinal parasites such as tapeworms, whipworms, hookworms, and roundworms, can cause inflammation and irritation at the base of your dog’s tail or around their anus. Chewing at the base of their tail can also cause pain, infection, and hair loss. 
"
"Take your dog to the vet if you see:
"
"Your vet will assess and possibly express your dog’s anal glands and/or they may send out a fecal sample for parasitic testing.
"
"Masses and growths may be small or large, and they may be firm or soft and filled with fluid, depending on the underlying cause. Some masses are painful while others are not.
"
"Cysts—These benign masses are often soft and move under the skin when you push on them. Cysts are usually not painful unless they are inflamed or infected.
"
"Trauma—If your dog hits their tail on something, it may swell up (similar to bruising in humans).
"
"Abscess—A pocket of infection in your dog’s tail may swell with fluid.
"
"Tumors—Both benign and malignant tumors can cause masses on your dog’s tail.
"
"Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian for evaluation and possible testing, such as a needle sample to assess cells, if you see any of the following:
"
"Does not go away on its own within 5-7 days
"
"Signs that your dog is in pain (licking tail excessively, howling if you touch it, not moving the tail the same, etc.)
"
"Mass becomes larger
"
"Swelling gets worse
"
"Discoloration
"
"Bleeding or oozing
"
"Abrasions, lacerations, and degloving are all common tail injuries.
"
"Abrasions are superficial wounds that usually result in hair loss, reddened skin, and sometimes scabbing or mild bleeding. These are often caused by trauma or rubbing the tail against a rough surface. 
"
"Treatment usually includes cleaning the area with gentle soap and water and keeping your dog from licking it with an Elizabethan collar.
"
"If an abrasion starts to bleed excessively, becomes swollen, or leaks, take your dog to see the vet. 
"
"Lacerations usually go deeper through the skin, and they can even affect the muscle, nerves, and sometimes bone. Bleeding is often severe. Your dog may continue wagging their tail while bleeding, which can create a messy scene.
"
"If your dog has an actively bleeding laceration, place a towel around their tail and/or hind end and get your dog to a veterinarian as soon as possible. 
"
"Degloving injuries are also very common. This type of injury occurs when the skin of the tail is fileted back to expose the underlying tissue, nerves, and muscle. These injuries often require tail amputation unless they are minor.
"
"Minor degloving injuries are treated by cleaning and bandaging the wound, plus an Elizabethan collar to avoid chewing and licking off the bandage during healing.
"
"Degloving injuries should always be treated by a vet.
"
"Your dog may also break, or fracture, their tail. Common causes of tail fractures include falling or having their tail closed in a door. You may see an obvious kink or displacement, swelling, signs of pain when you try to touch the tail, or even open wounds. 
"
"Knowing the location of the fracture helps determine treatment and healing. If the fracture is at the base of the tail, or if there’s nerve damage from a crushing injury to the vertebrae (such as from slamming the tail in a door), tail amputation may be required. Fractures located at the tail tip usually heal on their own, although though they can leave a permanent bump.
"
"An avulsion injury occurs when a dog’s tail is pulled and causes breakage or severe stretching of the nerves.
"
"In severe cases, dogs can become incontinent, as many of the nerves in the tail also control urination and defecation.
"
"Some types of fractures can also cause nerve damage, which can be detrimental if this occurs at the base of the tail. Nerve function may return with time, but more often, the damage is irreversible and may require further therapy or even tail amputation.
"
"Some dogs have neurologic degenerative diseases (such as degenerative myelopathy) that cause nerves to malfunction, and this affects the tail and the hind end. The most common breed affected by this disorder is the German Shepherd, although other large breeds such as the Great Dane are also commonly affected.
"
"If you see any of the following, take your dog to the vet immediately, as these can all be signs of medical emergencies:
"
"Active bleeding from a laceration/abrasion
"
"Signs of severe pain (panting, pacing, whining or crying, excessively chewing the tail)
"
"Obvious deviation of the tail with a concern for fracture
"
"Any of the above paired with: severe itching, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, incontinence, or trouble walking
"
"If your dog is suddenly doing or has any of the following, make an appointment to see the vet within a few days:
"
"Holding their tail limp
"
"Will not wag their tail
"
"Showing signs of pain when their tail is touched (panting, whining or crying, biting/growling/snapping)
"
"Swelling, growth, or lump that doesn’t go away within 5 days or seems painful
"
"Lump or mass that starts to drain fluid, changes color, and/or gets bigger

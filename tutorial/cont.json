{"value ": "By Dr. Joanne Intile, DVM, DACVMLearning that your pet has cancer is devastating. Deciding on which, if any, treatment path to take is confusing and it is normal to feel anxious as you are making decisions for your pet. Owners frequently struggle with feeling a lack of control and search for options to enhance their pet's prognosis during their treatment plan. While most of these choices are not harmful, sometimes an owner's best intentions can unknowingly offset their pet's progress. The following are suggestions of what to consider avoiding during cancer treatment to optimize your pet's care.Avoid starting your pet on any supplements or medications before talking to your primary veterinarian and/or veterinary oncologist.You might be tempted to start your pet on supplements, vitamins, or other medications as part of a regimen to aid in their body's defenses against cancer and to support them through their treatments. Most supplements do not undergo regulation regarding content. These products, which may be touted as \"natural,\" could negatively interact with your pet's prescribed medications, reducing the benefit of chemotherapy and harming your pet's system.Owners are often surprised to learn that some of the chemotherapy drugs we administer come from plants and are therefore also classified as natural substances. The effects of interactions between different natural substances, such as with conventional medicine and alternative medicine/supplements, are unpredictable at best. Veterinarians who cannot guarantee that mixing the two would not lead to treatment failure or harm will honestly explain their concerns and advise you on how to proceed.See Dietary Supplements and Cancer Treatment: A Risky Mixture to learn more about potential negative interactions between supplements and chemotherapy.Don't overfeed your pet.Some pets with cancer, especially cats, will show signs of a poor appetite during treatment. This occurs because of the disease process itself and in response to the prescribed treatments. In those cases, veterinarians frequently lift the typical dietary restrictions placed on companion animals and permit owners to offer a wider variety of foods, including typically prohibited menu items such as fast food or other kinds of \"people\" food. But for pets whose normal appetites are not being affected by treatment, overfeeding them and/or routinely offering food items the pet would not normally ingest can cause gastrointestinal upset, which may mimic adverse signs from treatment, leading to confusion about how best to proceed. In addition, pets can easily become overweight even with minimal overfeeding, which can exacerbate previous orthopedic disease and lead to concurrent health problems, including cardiorespiratory disease and pain, resulting in a reduction in the pet's quality of life.While it's understandable to want to keep your pet happy during this difficult time, it's better to shower your pet with attention and toys and activity and not to overdo it with calorie-rich \"comfort\" foods.Don't be a loner.You may encounter individuals who question your decision to treat your pet's cancer, arguing that you're being selfish or traumatizing your animals. Personally, I've been told countless times that treating pets with cancer is the equivalent of \"torturing\" them. Such harsh judgment can be isolating, making you second-guess your choices and intentions. Please find reassurance in knowing that there are thousands of owners who choose to treat their pets, just as you are, and these individuals can be your best resources for information and as sounding boards for you to express your concerns, questions, and frustrations.Many owners of pets that have undergone cancer treatment are happy to provide insight and advice to owners considering their options. This may be in person or via the Internet. For example, Tripawds is an online community of owners of pets with three (or fewer!) limbs that is an excellent resource for owners considering limb amputation for bone tumors.Skip the dog park (but only at the specific times outlined by your veterinary oncologist).Pets receiving chemotherapy can experience temporary drops in their white blood cell counts at specified times following their treatment. During these periods where the immune system is being compromised, animals are more susceptible to infection. While the overall risk of illness is low, there will likely be times you should avoid situations where your pet might encounter new pathogens. This may mean occasionally missing a trip to the dog park or groomer, or keeping your typically outdoor cat indoors for a short period of time. In addition, reducing stress levels to a minimum during periods where your pet may have lowered immune defenses is of utmost importance. This means limiting houseguests (two or four legged) if your pet is the kind to become anxious in such situations, avoiding boarding your pet if you decide to travel (get a pet sitter to stay at your home instead), or taking your pet with you rather than leaving them alone if they have a tendency toward separation anxiety.While such physical challenges may seem to cause significant negative impacts in your pet's quality of life, the important consideration is that this change is truly temporary and will only be for a few days following certain medical treatments your pet receives.Don't be afraid to ask your vet questions.You will likely have dozens of questions about your pet's condition and treatment plan and it's important to have those questions or concerns addressed as quickly and efficiently as possible. You probably won't think of all of them right away, so writing them down as they occur to you is important.While the internet is a valuable resource, internet writers do not know your pet personally. Your veterinarian and/or veterinary oncologist will be the most appropriate resource for your concerns. You should never feel that any question is insignificant, and if you are feeling that you or your pet's needs are not being met, voice your concerns. This empowers you to make the best decisions about your pet's care and to feel confident in the plan.Some questions to consider:What is the exact type of cancer my pet has and where in his/her body is it found?What signs should I look for that could indicate disease progression?How will I know if my pet is having a reaction to treatment?What can I do at home to help my pet through treatment and what are the \"triggers\" I should use to know when I need to call my veterinarian?What is the expected cost of treatment and further testing?Joanne Lynn Intile, DVM, MS, DACVIMVeterinarian"},
{"value ": "Do Dogs Get Dementia?Canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CCD or CDS) is a condition related to the aging of a dog's brain, which ultimately leads to changes in awareness, deficits in learning and memory, and decreased responsiveness to stimuli. This syndrome in dogs has been compared to dementia or Alzheimer's in humans.Although the initial dementia symptoms in dogs are mild, they gradually worsen over time, beyond what can be expected with normal aging. These pups experience cognitive decline, or the slow decrease in the brain's ability to perform normal tasks.Dog Dementia StagesDementia symptoms in dogs usually start slowly and build over time. Every pet is different, and the signs will also vary between animals. If your pup is starting to show signs of concern, contact your veterinarian. You can use the DISHAA map shown below to help know what to look for. For each category, give your dog a score from zero to four. Zero means no signs at all, while three means significant changes. If your dog scores more than four when you add up the total categories, it's time to contact their veterinarian.7 Common Dementia Symptoms in DogsThe DISHAA acronym can help pet parents characterize the most distinct signs and changes associated with CCD.DISHA refers to these symptoms:DisorientationInteractions with family members or other petsSleep-wake cycle changesHouse soilingActivity and anxiety level changes Let's look at the most common dementia symptoms in dogs.1. DisorientationOne of the most common things you may notice is that your senior dog gets disoriented even when he's in his normal or familiar environment.Your dog may also have trouble with spatial awareness. They may wander behind the couch and then realize they doesn't know where they are or how to get out.At bedtime, you may find your dog in a different part of the house, staring at the wall instead of curled up in their dog bed.2. InteractionsCanine cognitive dysfunction can affect your dog's interactions with people and other animals.Some dogs with CCD withdraw from their family and their favorite activities. They may fail to notice when the doorbell rings and seem disinterested in greeting visitors, or they may stop barking at the mail carrier. Your dog may not even respond when you get his leash out to go for a walk. Talk with your veterinarian if you notice changes in the way your dog interacts with those around him. They can help rule out potential health issues and help you learn how to support your dog's evolving needs.3. Sleep/Wake CyclesA change in sleep patterns or a disruption in circadian rhythms is one of the more specific dementia symptoms in dogs.Dogs that used to sleep soundly may now pace all night. Many dogs reverse their normal schedules, so their daytime activities become their nighttime activities. This nightly routine can be frustrating and tiring for pet parents.4. House SoilingUrinating or defecating in the house is one of the most common dog dementia symptoms, especially if the dog was previously house-trained.It's important to consider that your dog may have lost their ability to voluntarily control elimination or even to let you know that he needs to go outside.5. Activity and AnxietyDogs with cognitive dysfunction may show a decreased desire to explore and a decreased response to things, people and sounds in their environments.They may not greet you or they may no longer respond on cue to fetch their favorite toy. They may also be less focused and show an altered response to stimuli.6. Having Trouble Finding Food and Water BowlsSome dogs have trouble finding their food bowls. When dogs become disoriented and find themselves somewhere in the house where they do not usually spend time, they may have difficulty tracing their way back to their normal turf, including where their food and water lives. 7. Repetitive or Restless Movements  Although older dogs experience a normal decline in activity levels, they may also experience symptoms that seem like restlessness. Dogs may begin to pace randomly or stare out a window and bark when there is nothing there. They may repeatedly return to an area like a corner and then appear to get \"lost\". This will often be more common in the late evening and overnight hours, particularly if they are not able to use their vision as well as they used to. Using night lights and confining your pup to familiar areas may help to reduce these concerns.It's important to rule out medical conditions as certain symptoms—such as inappropriate urination or defecation—may have other causes.When to See a Veterinarian for Dog Dementia SymptomsMany dementia symptoms in dogs can also occur with medical problems, so it's important to consult your veterinarian when you first notice these signs. Your veterinarian may recommend some baseline tests such as blood work. This is not only check for a current underlying problem, but also to have results to compare to should things change in the future."},
{"value ": "With cancer in dogs and cats, early detection and treatment are critical. By detecting cancer early, you can work with your veterinarian to increase the chance of cure or remission.But noticing the subtle signs of cancer early enough can be difficult if you don't know what you are looking for, and sometimes the signs can be so subtle that pet parents may mistake them as a normal part of aging.Talk to your veterinarian if you notice any of the following subtle signs of cancer in your pet. If the cause is cancer, you can catch it early and start a treatment plan.1. Weight LossUnexplained weight loss in dogs and cats—especially when a pet isn't on a calorie-restricted diet—can be a sign of cancer. While some cancers can cause quick and dramatic weight loss that is hard to miss, it's more common that the weight loss is gradual over time. It can be so gradual that, initially, it goes unnoticed by the pet parent.Sometimes, weight loss isn't even noticed until the pet is taken to the veterinarian and the change in weight only becomes obvious when compared to historical weight measurements.If a pet is losing weight even though they're eating normally, then the top diseases to consider are diabetes mellitus, conditions that affect the digestive tract's ability to digest and absorb nutrients, hyperthyroidism (more common in cats), and cancer.2. Lumps and BumpsWhile lumps, bumps, and other skin changes are easier to notice on short-haired dogs or cats, many times they go unnoticed on long-haired pets.Pet parents will also often postpone a veterinary visit if a lump is small; however, you cannot determine if a skin lump is cancerous based on the size. Even the smallest skin lumps can be cancerous.Tumors of the mammary chain—also known as breast cancer—are often missed by pet owners. Female dogs and cats most commonly develop breast cancer when they were not spayed early in life.Dogs and cats are also subject to cancers of the gastrointestinal system, vascular system, liver, kidneys, urinary bladder, endocrine glands, immune system, lymphatic system, and reproductive organs. These cancers may cause fluid to accumulate or masses to form in the belly. If your pet is large or overweight, you may not notice any changes until they become life-threatening.Another place where lumps and bumps can be hidden is in the mouth. Dogs and cats can get oral tumors on the gums, palate, or tongue. Tumors under the tongue are very hard to find—unless you are looking for them!3. Changes in CoatA normal, healthy pet has a glossy, full coat. Changes in the coat can indicate cancer, such as:Hair lossBrittle or dry hairExcessive dandruff or scalingSkin infections that don't respond well to treatmentExcessive sheddingSkin cancers can directly affect a pet's coat, but so can cancer elsewhere in the body. For example, cancers of the endocrine system, such as tumors on the pituitary, thyroid, or adrenal glands, can all cause changes in your pet's coat.Overgrooming, no grooming, or excessive licking at a body part can also be subtle signs of cancer in both dogs and cats. If a body part is painful due to cancer, a dog may excessively lick that area, which can cause brown lick stains and hair loss.If a cat feels sick or is in pain, they may not groom enough or at all, which can lead to a matted, unkempt coat. Alternatively, cats are also known to overgroom and pull out hair in response to stress or pain.4. Changes in AppetiteAn increased or decreased appetite can be subtle signs of cancer in dogs and cats. If a pet is feeling yucky or is in pain, then they may not want to eat. Conversely, other cancers can cause a pet to eat more than normal. Some cancers consume a lot of calories, which will increase a pet's appetite (if they are feeling well enough to eat).Certain types of aggressive, malignant cancers can cause a pet to eat normal or more than normal amounts of food and still lose weight. And benign tumors of the adrenal or pituitary glands can cause a condition called Cushing's disease that leads to hormonal changes and an increased appetite.5. Changes in Urination or Bowel MovementsChanges in your pet's bathroom schedule are worthy of note when it comes to early detection. Different types of cancer can cause changes in your pet's potty habits, from an increased need for potty time to constipation.For example:Cancer of the gastrointestinal system can cause diarrhea and/or constipation.Cancer of the adrenal gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, liver, or kidneys can increase thirst in dogs and cats and lead to an increased need to urinate.Cancer of the urinary system can increase the urge to pee but sometimes obstruct the urethra, which makes it difficult to urinate. So, pets with urinary cancer may have to pee frequently, have accidents inside the house, or seem to strain when urinating.6. Changes in BehaviorA change in behavior can also be a subtle sign of brain cancer, metabolic changes associated with cancer, or cancer pain. This includes:A lack of energy or lack of interest in the things that used to bring your pet joyAccidents in the houseChanges in sleep patternsPacingIncreased aggression or clinginessSeizures or tremors can also be a sign of cancer, and unless you witness them, they can be missed by pet parents. Some signs that may indicate a pet has experienced a seizure include loss of balance, twitching, excessive drooling, and temporary blindness.7. CoughingCancer can cause dogs and cats to cough, so any dog or cat that develops a persistent cough needs to be seen by a veterinarian. A persistent cough can be a potential sign of a tumor pressing on an airway, fluid in or around the lungs, or lung tumors.Persistent coughing can also be a sign of other pet health issues, so if your pet has a cough they cannot seem to kick, it's always best to take them to their veterinarian.How You Can Help Detect Cancer in Pets EarlyVeterinarians are trained to notice any abnormalities in your dog or cat, and a veterinary examination is your best weapon against cancer.However, most pets only see their veterinarian once or twice a year. So, it's helpful if you play an active role in monitoring your pet's health as well. As a pet parent, you see your pet every day, which means you can keep a look out for these potential subtle signs of cancer.To do at-home checks, you can run your hands over your pet to feel for any lumps or bumps and visually inspect your pet. Don't forget to inspect the nipples and surrounding tissues in female dogs and cats for any changes, lumps, or bumps.Feel your pet's rib cage for any signs of weight gain or loss, or better yet, weigh them monthly and keep a log so you can notice trends early. Look in your pet's mouth and check their teeth and gums. Hold a treat out, and let your pet lick the treat while you visually inspect the top and bottom of the tongue.Pet guardians know their pets best, and by conducting these monthly at-home inspections, you may be more likely to catch subtle signs of cancer early enough to make a difference.Featured Image: iStock.com/Neniia LantiSarah Wooten, DVMVeterinarianDr. Sarah Wooten graduated from UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine in 2002.

{"value ": "Reviewed and updated for accuracy on June 7, 2019 by Dr. Natalie Stilwell, DVM, MS, PhDAh, the joys of the outdoors. Swimming, hiking and going to the park—all reasons to look forward to going outside. But fleas? Not so much.Not only are these blood-sucking parasites unsightly and creepy, but they can also cause some serious issues, such as allergies and skin infections.So, how can you keep your dog flea-free year-round?All pets in your household should receive flea prevention, even if you don't think they have fleas. All pets are at risk, including those that don't spend much time outside. It just takes one trip outdoors to bring fleas into the home, which can quickly infest the house and put you and your pets at risk.It's also important to provide flea prevention year-round, even in colder climates, as fleas will happily survive in a heated home environment for up to a year.Here are 9 methods for keeping fleas away—not just from biting your canine companions but also from getting into your home in the first place.1. Flea ShampooGiving your dog a flea bath with a special medicated flea shampoo can be an inexpensive (though labor-intensive) method of protecting your dog year-round. Many flea shampoos kill fleas on contact and prevent them from returning.In addition to killing adult fleas during bathing, the best flea shampoos for dogs also prevent flea eggs and larvae from maturing into adults for a prolonged period of time. Many of these shampoos also include ingredients like oatmeal or aloe to soothe itchy skin.You may need to give your dog a flea bath as often as every one to two weeks, as the effective ingredients won't last as long as a topical or oral medication.2. Topical Flea and Tick TreatmentsWhile topical flea medications seem like they would only work on the spot they are applied to, they are actually very effective at covering the dog's entire body.The drops work by a process of translocation, where the dog's oil glands spread the medication throughout the body.These medications are not affected by bathing, swimming or being out in the rain.Topical treatments will kill and repel fleas for several weeks before the need for reapplication and may also work to interrupt the flea life cycle.Your veterinarian can help you to pick out the best topical product for your dog that's appropriate for her age, size and breed. You will need your vet's prescription to purchase topical flea and tick medication.3. Oral Flea and Tick MedicationFlea pills are popular with pet parents, and they can be used alone or in combination with topical treatments depending on how severe the flea risk is.Once-a-month flea control pills come in the form of small, chewable tablets. They work to disrupt the life cycle of fleas but will not kill adult fleas on your pet.Flea pills are somewhat easy to administer, even for dogs that are difficult to medicate, with added flavors to make them more like treats.4. Flea CollarFlea collars are another option, though their effectiveness may depend on the invasiveness of the fleas in your environment and how much contact the flea collar makes with your dog's skin (in order to transfer the chemicals).Your veterinarian can help you decide if a flea collar is an effective solution for your dog.Before choosing a particular flea collar, find one that is appropriate for your dog's age and size. Keep in mind that some collars can have a strong smell that may be offensive, so be sure to read reviews before purchasing. After fitting a flea collar for your dog, cut off any excess length of collar to prevent your dog from chewing on it. Watch for signs of discomfort (e.g., excessive scratching) when your dog is wearing the collar in case an allergic reaction occurs.5. Flea DipA flea dip is a concentrated chemical that needs to first be diluted in water and then applied to the dog's fur with a sponge or poured over their back.This is not like a shampoo bath, and you will not rinse your dog off after applying the dip product.The chemicals used in flea dips typically kill adult fleas for two weeks or less. These chemical products can be very potent and are messy to administer, so flea dips have become less popular than other control methods.Ask your veterinarian if a flea dip is recommended for your dog; misuse can lead to toxic reactions, both in pets and in the people treating them.6. Flea Powders, Sprays and WipesFlea powders (the kind you apply on your pet), sprays and wipes are relatively inexpensive methods for repelling fleas.However, the spray or fine powder forms can be irritating to the mouth and lungs if breathed in (for both dogs and humans). It's important to avoid applying these products near your pet's eyes, nose and mouth.As these products will wear off the skin faster than a topical treatment, you may need to reapply them as often as every two days.Ask your vet before using flea powders, sprays and wipes, and use them with caution. These are not the most effective or convenient methods for flea control on your pet.7. Cleaning the HouseDid you know that adult fleas account for less than five percent of the total flea population in an infected home? That's why a thorough house cleaning is a crucial step in breaking the parasite's life cycle for even mild infestations.You will need to clean daily until the situation has been brought under control, as immature fleas can persist for several months in the environment.Vacuum the entire house, giving extra focus to your dog's favorite areas and all corners and baseboards. A recent study has shown that vacuuming can collect and kill fleas at all life stages—it is 96 percent effective at killing adult fleas and 100 percent effective at killing flea eggs.Wash all of your dog's bedding and toys with hot, soapy water, and vacuum the car, too. Even if your dog never rides in your car, you may be carrying fleas on your shoes or pant cuffs.Removing the majority of flea eggs and larvae will help reduce the population of adult fleas hatching in your home.8. Household Sprays, Carpet Flea Powders and FoggersTo further treat your home, sprays, carpet flea powders and/or foggers are available that will kill the adult fleas, as well as the larvae and eggs as they hatch.Sprays and foggers are available at your veterinarian's office, but they must be used with caution, as these products can be toxic to fish, birds, cats and children.Most carpet flea powders claim to kill adult fleas, flea eggs and flea larvae, and some will even kill ticks.Read labels carefully and ask for advice from your veterinarian before attempting to use these products. If you're concerned about treating your home thoroughly in cases of severe infestation, you may want to hire a professional exterminator.9. Trimming Your Yard           Keeping your lawn, bushes and trees consistently trimmed back will help reduce the population of fleas in your backyard.If you still have a problem, consider using yard sprays or granular treatments. Or, you might consider hiring a pest control service for regular yard treatments.Just be careful when using these products, as they can be harmful to pets, pond fish and humans.Talk to your vet about which of these methods you should be using for your own flea situation—you might need combine several to provide comprehensive flea treatment for your pets and your home.Featured Image: iStock.com/sanjagrujic"},
{"value ": "What Is a Urinary Problem in a Dog?A dog's urinary tract consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. These anatomical parts of the urinary tract are located inside the abdomen as well as in an area in the back of the abdomen called the retroperitoneal space.The urinary tract has many functions, some of the most important include filtering the blood to remove toxins, maintaining balance of electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium), and reabsorbing water for the body. Urine is created as a waste by-product. Unfortunately, problems can occur at any of the areas along the urinary tract. Problems of the urinary tract can range from an uncomplicated infection to serious cancersUrinary Tract Infection in DogsUrinary tract infection or \"UTI,\" is a general term most often used to describe infection of the lower part of the urinary tract (the urinary bladder and/or urethra). Urinary tract infections can cause straining to urinate, blood in the urine, frequently urinating small volumes only or urinating in inappropriate places. Urinary tract infections are common in dogs and can be caused by many different types of bacteria. Urinary tract infections can also occur secondary to an underlying problem such as urinary crystals, stones, or cancers.Urinary Bladder Infection in Dogs Urinary bladder infections are also common in dogs and typically are treatable and curable. A UTI can be painful and require a prescription medication to resolve. Some dogs with a urinary bladder infection will drink more water. Therefore, it is important to monitor your dog's drinking and urinary habits. Lower Urinary Tract Disease in Dogs\"Lower urinary tract disease\" is a general term that can describe multiple problems of the bladder and/or urethra. Some dogs experience infection, while others can have inflammation without infection (sterile cystitis). The symptoms are similar for both issues, but are treated differently, depending on the cause. Many dogs will drink more, strain to urinate, pass blood in their urine, or have accidents in the house.Urinary Bladder Stones in Dogs Stones that develop in a dog's urinary bladder can become an emergency, if left untreated. When first formed in the body, they may go unnoticed for some time. However, if a stone from the urinary bladder moves to the urethra (which has a much smaller diameter), it can become stuck and block the flow of urine.This can cause the urinary bladder to overfill and rupture, causing dogs to become septic and die from urine leakage inside the abdomen. Many dogs with urinary bladder stones will strain to urinate or attempt to urinate repeatedly but pass only small amounts of urine.Urinary Bladder Cancer in Dogs The most common type of cancer that develops in the urinary bladder in dogs is called transitional cell carcinoma. It most often develops in an area of the bladder called the trigone, where urine exits the bladder into the urethra to be voided. This painful cancer can cause symptoms such as straining to urinate, blood in the urine, and urinating small volumes at a time.Urinary Incontinence in DogsUrinary incontinence is a common urinary problem seen most often in female dogs, but it can also occur in males. Urinary incontinence typically is seen as leaking of urine (large or small volumes) where the pet has been lying. Urinary incontinence often results from weak sphincter muscle tone at the urinary bladder.Kidney Failure in DogsThere are many causes of kidney failure in dogs, including injury, infection, toxins, some medications, and cancer. Ultimately, when the kidneys can no longer perform their function, dogs struggle with multiple symptoms. Typically, dogs suffering with kidney failure have a decreased appetite, often urinate large amounts of urine, experience possible weight loss, and may have episodes of vomiting and/or diarrhea.Less Common Urinary Tract Conditions in DogsDiseases of the urinary tract in dogs that can have similar symptoms—but are less common—include pyelonephritis (kidney infection), kidney stones, proteinuria, neurologic conditions affecting the urinary bladder (atony), and problems of the ureters or urethra (e.g., strictures, diverticulum).Diseases that start in other body systems, but may show signs in the urinary tract, include prostate diseases in male dogs, pyometra in female dogs, Cushing's disease (hyperadrenocorticism), diabetes mellitus, and diabetes insipidus. Symptoms of Urinary Issues in DogsAs a pet parent it's important to know your pet's normal patterns and behaviors when drinking, eating, urinating, and defecating. For pets that live in multiple-pet households and share the same bowl for water, it can be difficult to tell, so you may need to temporarily separate your pets to determine what is normal and abnormal for each.The most common symptoms of urinary issues in dogs are related to the amount of water consumed (too much or too little) and abnormal urination patterns such as straining to urinate, urinating small or large volumes, having urinary accidents, or having blood present in the urine.Causes of Urinary Issues in DogsUrinary issues in dogs are common and many are treatable. Dogs of all ages, breeds, and sizes, as well as both male and female dogs, get urinary issues. Sometimes the cause can be prevented with proper hygiene and weight management. Other times, genetics, diet, and lifestyle play a role in the development of urinary issues.How Veterinarians Diagnose Urinary Issues in DogsMany types of urinary problems have similar symptoms. However, treatment is different based on the cause of the issue, so it is important to make a proper diagnosis. Your veterinarian will likely order some tests to aid in determining the cause.Initially, a urinalysis test is performed to examine your pet's urine. This urine sample needs to be fresh. Sometimes, your veterinarian may also analyze bloodwork, submit urine for culturing, take X-rays, or use an ultrasound to better evaluate your pet's urinary problem. Most of these tests can be done with your regular veterinarian, but in some cases pets may need to be referred to an internal medicine specialist for more advanced testing like an endoscopy or biopsy sampling.Treatment of Urinary Problems in DogsDepending on the issue, treatment can range from a short course of medication or dietary changes to surgical intervention. When you notice any urinary issues, it is best to seek the help of your veterinarian as soon as possible to determine a diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy.   Recovery and Management of Urinary Issues in DogsMany urinary issues can be resolved with therapy, and your dog can get back to its normal activities. If your veterinarian recommends follow-up testing after a course of medications, it is important to complete this step to make sure that the problem is stabilized, improving, or completely cleared. When your dog has its annual exam, make sure to discuss any changes in eating, drinking, and eliminating with your veterinarian.Try to keep your pet at a proper weight and follow strict hygiene, as long hair/mats around the urogenital area can contribute to urinary problems. Occasionally when a pet has diarrhea, it can lead to urinary issues, as the rectum and vulva in females are near each other. Be sure your pet has access to clean, fresh drinking water at all times.Some people even choose to use bottled water for their pets with urinary problems. There are some diets and supplements based on promoting urinary health that can be beneficial. However, different urinary problems require different approaches to maintain bladder health, so always work with your veterinarian before starting any therapy, including diets and supplements.References Veterinary Information Network.
